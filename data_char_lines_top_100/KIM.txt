I'm really not interested. You were about to try to sell me something, right? And you happen to have several to choose from? We were warned about the Ferengi at the Academy. That's right. What I meant was My name? Kim, Harry Kim. But I You know, I think a memento for my parents would be a great idea. Really. What are these? It would make a great pendant for my mother. Cufflinks. Great idea. How much for the entire tray? Thanks. Er, I haven't paid my respects to the Captain yet either. Thank you, sir. I'm sorry, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. (Rear of the bridge, on the right as we view it.) Thrusters ready. Is it true? They said you falsified reports. Why? But then you came forward and you admitted that it was your fault? It must have been especially tough for you, being the son of an admiral. I don't need anyone to choose my friends for me. Captain, I'm reading a coherent tetryon beam scanning us. I'm not sure. There's also a displacement wave moving toward us. It's some kind of polarised magnetic variation. The graviton field had no effect. The wave will intercept us in twelve seconds. Five seconds. Three. (Cavit is sent flying across the bridge as the wave hits. White out. The bridge is a mess with broken conduits and shorting cables. Janeway checks Cavit for a pulse. Nothing.) Hull breach, deck fourteen. Comm. lines to Engineering are down. Trying to re-establish. Captain, there's something out there. I don't know. I'm reading. I'm not sure what I'm reading. I'm trying. (A space station with four arms upper and lower, and two larger ones centre, appears on screen. It is firing energy pulses in one direction, away from Voyager.) Captain, if these sensors are working, we're over seventy thousand light years from where we were. We're on the other side of the galaxy. (After Voyager moves in closer to the station and finds the little Maquis ship, the dead and injured are being stretchered off the bridge.) I'm not reading any life signs on the Maquis ship. Our sensors can't penetrate it. Massive bursts of radiant energy. They seem to be directed toward a nearby G-type star system. No response from the array. Multiple percussive injuries. He's dead. Trianoline? That could be a problem. We're pretty far away from replacements right now. (The EMH gives one man a hypo then hands it to Kim.) There's no indication of stable matter. All this must be some kind of holographic projection. What's down there? Paris, she's only a hologram. Whoa. Sporocystian life signs. What's in the barn? There is a life form here. Just one. It's everywhere. I'm also reading some kind of matrix-processing device. It may be the holographic generator. Paris, humanoid life signs over here. I'm reading a Vulcan and several humans. What am I doing here? Where am I? Ill? No, no. There's some mistake. I'm not (He sees growths on his forearm and chest.) It's okay. It's okay. My name is Kim. Harry Kim. I'm an ensign on the Starship Voyager. I was kidnapped from the array just like you were. I don't know where we are. We were looking for you, actually. One minute we're in the Badlands, the next Yeah. Consider yourself captured. Oh, I know I have a phaser here somewhere. There's no point. It's locked. Hey! Hey, hey, hey. What's that going to accomplish? Look, do you want them to sedate you again? What's your name, Maquis? What's wrong with us? What are these things? We're underground. The Warming? (A crowd gathers.) Is this how the Caretaker communicates with you? (The eating area has large picture windows showing different scenes - sunset, clouds, waterfall.) I'm curious to know how you've interpreted the Caretaker's reason for sending us here. Look, I'm sure Captain Janeway is doing everything she can to find us. Should I call for some help? Appreciate this, but the only way we're going to survive is if we can get to the surface and find our own people. Power supply. Nobody knows why? How? Please. It's our only chance.  [Sickbay] (The EMH is treating the young girl's bruises.) I'm sorry. Maybe I'd do better if I had a little Klingon blood in me. You know, I spent my whole life getting ready for Starfleet. And on my very first mission, I'm going to die. Sneezy? You went to the Academy. You know, I never really liked Zakarian. Took you long enough. Friend? What makes you think I'm your friend? I don't know, Doc. It's my first mission. (Chakotay, Torres and Kim leave.) Aye, Captain.  [Barn] (Owls hoot and dogs bark.) The Kazon just got some back up. Channel open. They're increasing fire, Captain. Shields are holding. The lead Kazon ship is hailing us.
Not yet. We tried hooking them to the power grid and we ended up blowing out half the relays. The holodeck's energy matrix, it just isn't compatible with the other power systems. What about Cargo Bay two? It was designed for organic storage and it already has adjustable environmental controls. I think I've found the source of the transmission. (The distant image of a ship appears on the viewscreen against the black hole.) No. The subspace interference is too heavy. We're little busy right now. We'll get to it  [Sickbay] KIM Engineering, check your power levels. I'm showing  [Engineering] KIM Power to the tractor beam is down eighty percent. The gravimetric force of the singularity is pulling us in! I'm picking up a highly localised disturbance off the port bow. Well, they show we've travelled one point four light years away from the anomaly, but I've confirmed our position against the star chart. We're definitely back where we started. Doesn't make sense. Distance from the singularity is ten million kilometres and increasing. Eleven million. Twelve million. (beep beep) I don't get it. Mister Paris, have we altered course? Then something's really wrong here. It's ahead of us again. I'll have the results in about an hour. So, I hear there's been some trouble down in Engineering. That's not what I hear. I hear that the whole department's up in arms, that the Maquis and Starfleet people are almost at each other's throats. I just hope you're right. Things are bad enough around here without, ow! Yeah. I just have this splitting headache and (Kim falls to his knees.) Dizzy. Can't, can't focus.  [Briefing room]  EMH [on It's working. We're cutting through the distortions. Compensating for amplitude distortion. Could we have travelled back in time and met ourselves? So what do we do to get out? Initialising plasma flow. Not yet. Warp particles at full intensity. The rupture's over fifty million kilometres away. We don't have enough power to project a dekyon beam that far. They've widened the rupture by almost thirty five percent. Hull integrity has dropped  [Shuttlecraft] The rupture's now one hundred twenty metres in diameter. That leaves us with less than two metres clearance on either side. The rupture's collapsing. It's down to one hundred ten metres wide. Switching to auxiliary power.
No, I really want to get on that transtator assembly diagnostic. I'm sorry. I've got a girl back home. I plan on seeing mine again. I hope so. I told you, I need to run a transtator diagnostic. What did you tell them about me? Record. I never broke any record! Minor hull breach on deck three. Contained. Shields are holding. All vegetation on the planet has been destroyed. This is one of the subspace fractures we've located with a magneton scan of the surface. This is the time of the explosion, where the fracture opens. Then as the shock waves dissipate, the fracture grows more narrow. We believe that the Captain and Lieutenant Paris are trapped at the narrow end. That's consistent with the subspace damage we've observed. We're counting on it. First we have to find a fracture in a location where they've been. Then we have to microscan the fracture to try to pick up the signal from their subspace beacon. We're not sure yet. [Sickbay] (The EMH is scanning Kes with his medical tricorder.) At intense levels it can open a subspace fracture. Only problem is, at the necessary intensity, the polaric generator will burn itself out after thirty seconds at best. Commander, I'm picking up a signal from a comm. badge. No, it's not on subspace. It's here, now. Kim to Janeway. Kim to Paris. Yes, sir. This way. [Room] The comm. badge is designed to self-activate when the casing is destroyed to help searchers locate victims. Got it. Initiating generator. We figure the Captain and Paris might have looked for the origin of the explosion to try and prevent it. The polaric levels are higher here than any place we've been so far. Aye, sir.  [Corridor ] (Janeway is working her way closer, hiding behind blocks that link tubes together. She has a local weapon ready.) I have it. Initiating generator. If the widest point of the fracture represents the time of the explosion, couldn't we open a hole just before the widest point? Increasing generator to maximum output. The generator's overloading. I hope so. I told you, I need to run a transtator diagnostic. What did you tell them about me? Record? I never broke any record!
We're picking up definite dilithium signatures, Captain. The strongest readings are originating from ten to twenty kilometres inside the planetoid. Deck four. [Planetoid] What's happening, Doctor? Captain, I've analysed the sensor logs from Neelix's tricorder. The bio-scanner picked up a single class three humanoid organism. Sounds like our tricorders aren't giving us the real picture behind what's going on here. You're right, Captain. There's a two degree differential in this section of the wall. So there are actually no dilithium deposits on this planet. Are these organs? Captain. (He has found another door.) I can't scan the interior. The surface stratum is made up of some sort of neutronium alloy. It doesn't look like a natural formation. It's possible. Not yet. [Sickbay] (The area above Neelix has been decorated, and the lights dimmed.) We appear to be seeing Voyager and the alien ship reflecting off the walls of the chamber. Aye, Captain. [Doctor's office] The power drain is coming from somewhere in this chamber, Captain. It's some kind of dampening field. It's bleeding energy directly from the warp nacelles. It appears to be coming from two one seven mark zero one five. Distance, five hundred and forty seven metres. Wait a minute. I think I've found the real ship. Picking up two life signs.
There's an ancient Chinese curse, Captain. May you live in interesting times. Mealtime is always interesting now that Neelix is in the kitchen. We should've asked her to join us. Why not? Well, what's wrong with showing a little courtesy? Well, who else is she supposed to get chummy with out here? There aren't many other captains and admirals for her to talk to. I think you're working from an old rule book, Paris. (Janeway tries to pour herself a cup of coffee at the counter, but the jug is empty.) Seven AU's in diameter. Sensors are picking up intermittent gamma and thermal emissions. Nothing our shields can't handle. I've never seen anything like it. (Tuvok uses his comm. badge.) Yes, sir. Can't do it, Captain. The thoron emissions of the barrier would interfere with the transporter signal. Kim to Tuvok. In other words, you've never seen anything like it. Oh, I promise not to tell the junior officers. We've lost five percent of our energy reserves. Recommend we shut down all non-essential systems. Energy reserves are down eight percent. Thrusters firing. (Thump!) Energy reserves are still falling. Eleven percent, Captain. What? See? How'd you get in here? Are you kidding? MacAllister got me through fourth year quantum chemistry. Besides, I got used to wearing it. Something about it that reminds me of being in the womb. I remember being in my mother's womb. I do. So what is it you have to show me? What is it, a French bistro? Hi. (RIcky gives Paris a passionate kiss.) Just a cup of tea. I don't like to drink this late at night. I get an acid heartburn. Sorry. Somebody picked your pocket? On Earth? Mosconi? Was he some famous billiard player? I'll keep it in mind. What's a fin? You shrug it off, or you like to make the rest of us think you're shrugging it off, but you miss it too, don't you? Home. (Paris breaks.) If my research is right, releasing positive ions through the nacelle should repel some of the dust out there. I believe so, Captain. Ion release confirmed. We're being hit by some kind of multi-polar charges. They're not like anything we saw the first time. Electroplasma leaks reported on deck fourteen. Repair crews are being dispatched. Otherwise, we seem to be in one piece. Yes, sir. I'll get right on it. Affirmative, Captain. Aye, Captain. Microprobe is loaded and ready. Acknowledged. I will. (Kim gets out of the turbolift then turns.) Captain? Well, I don't mean to be out of place, but if you'd care to join us, you'd be welcome.
There. It's registering only on subspace bands. We don't even have it on long range sensors yet. Too far away. We'd have to be within a thousand kilometres to get a detailed analysis. That would mean a significant course change. Affirmative, Captain, and the anomaly is still registering on subspace bands. Aye Captain. It's virtually microscopic. The aperture is only about thirty centimetres in diameter. That's right. It could carry a compressed data transmission to Federation space in minutes. I can't get any directional readings at all. The aperture is too small. We're receiving telemetry. (The viewscreen shows a green tunnel.) Microscopic gravitational eddies, extremely constricted spatial dimensions. The pathway's barely wider than the probe itself. No, I can do it. Maybe it'll take longer to get through, but the wormhole's still stable enough to carry a transmission. I'll try extrapolating the verteron exit vector. No, I can't get it. There's a strange phase variance in the radiation stream. We'll have to wait until the probe exits. It's stuck. It's mired in a gravitational eddy, and because the wormhole's in a state of collapse, those eddies are incredibly dense. That probe will never break free, Captain, and we'll have no way of finding out where the wormhole ends. Captain? Our probe was just scanned. There's somebody on the other side of the wormhole. [Sickbay] (The Doctor and new assistant Kes have a patient - a man with a sore wrist.) That's possible, but you'd think our probe would have detected something like that. But until then it should continue to transmit telemetry. Yes. I can modify our subspace communications band to accept the probe as a booster. This has to work. It'll mean so much to people back home to know we're alive and headed for Federation space. It's still going to be hard on my folks. I always called them once a week, even when I was on my training missions. I've never been out of contact for so long. How about you? Any family? And your mom? You think? Isn't there anyone back home who'll be worried about you? Engineering to Bridge. [Bridge] Okay, we'll be ready to go online in a couple of minutes. Let's try inverting the narrow band filter. (Janeway enters from her Ready room.) I think we're ready to give it a try, though we're pushing through some pretty heavy gravitational interference. I can't guarantee the clarity of the transmission. Narrow the bandpass some more. Try again, Captain. No response, Captain. We didn't have any trouble configuring the protocols, but that phase variance in the radiation stream gave us a few problems. Torres is going to balance it manually from Engineering. I'll increase power to the [Bridge] KIM Thirty seven megajoules. [Bridge] (The cylinder solidifies and Telek takes hold of it.) Then lets do it. It's better than trying to spend the next seventy years trying to get back. Phase variance is out of synch again.
There was no reason to say no, but if we hadn't gone with him that night, none of this would have happened. [The Ren's home] (A small hairy dog is yapping.) We went into the other room and started to work on the navigational beam specifications. [Sickbay] Acknowledged. (They watch the shuttlecraft being dragged towards the stern of the Numiri patrol ship.)
The element has an unusually large atomic mass, over five hundred and fifty nucleons. And the readings are constant. The element appears to be stable. The element is present in most of the asteroids that comprise the rings. I can isolate a sample and beam it aboard. I wouldn't miss it, sir. [Asteroid tunnel] With all due respect, Captain, I have to disagree with the Commander. This is our first contact with this race, and I think we should be learning all we can about them. [Bridge] KIM Commander, thanks for letting me voice my opinion to the Captain. What was it? What makes you think they believe in an afterlife at all? A dimensional distortion is forming. Some kind of subspace vacuole. Let me out! [Waiting area] (Divided into cubicles by movable metal screens. A woman gives an ornate box to a man.) Come back from where? I'm not sure. I just sort of woke up inside one of those pods. I was conducting an investigation on an asteroid, we found some dead bodies, then there was some kind of subspace phenomenon. Ensign Harry Kim of the Federation starship Voyager. We call ourselves human. We come from a planet called Earth in a distant part of the galaxy. Look, can you tell me where I am? Just Harry's fine. We were investigating one of the asteroids in the rings around your planet. So the subspace vacuole must have transported me somewhere else. Do you have any star charts I could look at? I'd like to figure out where I am now in relation to where I was. Another dimension? Dying. So she wasn't dead yet? Spectral rupture. This looks like what we would call a subspace vacuole. Does the cenotaph create these ruptures? That's right. There were seven females, eleven males. Some of the bodies had been there for years, others just for a few days. Well, that's what it looked liked to us. Doctor, maybe I should just stop right there. This is what my people call a first contact situation, and we've learned to be very careful about how much we tell alien cultures we've just met. Bioanalysis? Look, all I want to do is get back to my ship. And I think there might be a way to use this spectral rupture of yours to I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Everyone keeps asking me that, and I just keep giving the same answer. I don't know. I come from a different reality, maybe another dimension. Maybe it is your afterlife. I don't know. All I do know is that there are countless billions of people there who are born, live and die, just like you do here. Yes, but, look, for all I know, your thanatologists are right, and all I saw were the corporeal remains of your people, and you do go on to a higher consciousness. I, I really can't say. I don't know what happens to your people after they die. I don't even know what happens to my people after they die. Well, sort of. There have certainly been medical experts, philosophers, theologians who have spent a great deal of time debating what happens after death. But no one's come up with an answer yet. Is that why you're here? Because you're not happy with your life? Your family? It's not my place to judge your culture, but from my perspective, it's a little chilling to hear that. Look. If my ship is still searching for me, they're not going to stay there forever. I have to get back. Then maybe I can figure out a way to get back. Let me take a look at one of those cenotaphs. Wait! What are you doing? So they make you wrap yourself in your own death shroud. Can't you just back out? Say you've changed your mind. What if you did disappear into the mountains, but your family thought you were dead? I mean, they're here for a transference ritual, right? It's perfect. Those cenotaphs send your people back to my dimension, which is where I want to go. Voyager's probably still near the asteroid searching for me. As soon as I appear, they'll pick up my signal and beam me aboard. And you, you can just disappear. Your family will think you're dead, and you can live out your life in the mountains. Well, if Voyager can beam me aboard quickly enough, our doctor should be able to revive me. Medicine's pretty advanced in our culture. I've heard of cases where people have been dead for hours and still been brought back to life. No, it's not, but I think this is my only chance to get home. No, not at all. Please. Better. I'll be ready for duty tomorrow morning. Captain, I'm fine. Thank you, Captain. I have been a little preoccupied with the experience. I mean, all those people think that they know what happens after death. They look forward to it. They're prepared for it. But the truth is, none of it's real. They don't have an afterlife. They just decay inside those asteroids. Are you saying you think they do have an afterlife? That the energy field is where they exist at a higher level of consciousness, just like they believe? Thank you, Captain. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Is what true? What have you been telling people? The holodeck? You've got to be kidding. That lasted all of fifteen minutes. Nothing. Nothing. We talked, and then I fell over the side. Captain, sensors indicate five lifeforms aboard. Aye, Captain. (The image of a human looking man comes on the viewscreen.) That's beautiful. Are you a musician? Then it must work on a principle of non-linear resonance, adjusting to the dynamic variables in the atmosphere. In a sense. Can you show me how to operate it? So the whole thing exploded and there we were, seventy thousand light years from home and no way to get back. It felt pretty lonely. Noble? Sure. It's no secret. Go right ahead. I've got a few others too. Why is it so much warmer here? (A breeze starts up.) What is that? Dawn? We just got here. That's, that is an amazing feeling. What's happening? I'll say. Why am I seeing two suns? But your planet only has one sun. Eudana, where are we? How far? Please, it's important. That's almost forty thousand light years. (Euphoric Eudana cuddles up to Kim.) Er, we have to go back. No, er, we're going back, and I need you to tell me everything you know about that platform that got us here. [Plaza] Captain! Excuse me for interrupting but I've just found out about something incredible. That platform. It's a transportation device. Extremely sophisticated. It operates on the principle of folding space. Well, these people have. I've just been to Alastria and back. Alastria is forty thousand light years away. Apparently it's never been used to move anything as large as Voyager, but as I understand the principle of space folding, the size of the object isn't relevant. But we wouldn't abuse it. Don't you see what it would mean to us? Still, there's a reason why it's Starfleet's General order number one. On the whole, it does a lot more good than harm. Stories. Stories are an important part of their culture. They seem to provide more than entertainment. They're kind of a measuring rod of values and beliefs. We have a huge library in our databanks. We could offer them the whole thing. All the great literature of dozens of cultures. What's wrong? She will. [Janeway's quarters] (Janeway is entertaining Gath with a piece of pie.) I don't understand. Why is it so important I come here now? What's this about? Is that something you're authorised to do? So you'd stand to benefit from this arrangement, right? Captain Janeway has asked the Magistrate to send us forty thousand light years. Right. No, he just made it clear that our only choice was to get the trajector technology from him. Goodnight, Captain. Lieutenant. (Kim leaves.)
Where's Ensign Seska? She was picking berries with our group over by the hillside. There were caves nearby. There are fluctuating nucleonic patterns. It might indicate a reactor breakdown on board. Captain, I'm showing an unauthorised autosequence in Transporter Room two. Someone's left Voyager. I've got a lock on her, Captain. Do you want me to transport her back? Energising. [Sickbay] Four minutes.
Yeah, good work. Would you mind telling me where I was? Captain's log, stardate 48710.5. Since the return of our missing crewmen, we've been unable to locate any further traces of the photonic aliens.  [Doctor's office]
[OC]: Bridge to Captain Janeway. Two, but they're very faint. Aye, Captain. [Sickbay] (Tuvok is unconscious on a biobed.) According to my readings, the command was issued from the conn. Course laid in. Our new heading is one twenty one mark six. The helm's not responding. I'm locked out. (Tuvok goes over to help.) Captain, we're dropping to impulse power. I'm reading a massive energy drain all over the ship, and the warp core is shutting down. The captain wants to seal off all critical areas of the ship. Make sure the access hatch of Jefferies tube A-seventeen is secured. We're not sure yet, but we think it's some kind of noncorporeal alien. Medical emergency. Deck seven, section thirteen alpha. Captain's log, supplemental. It appears that Mister Tuvok and Kes were both hit by an unidentified energy discharge. Tuvok was not badly hurt, but Kes is in a coma. [Briefing room] Whoa. What did I do? I was just thinking. I was remembering an old study I saw about magneton scanners. I guess my mind started to wander a bit. Not yet. Whoever did this put up one hell of a roadblock. I'm going to have to break through at least six levels of encryption to access the holo-emitters. Two, maybe three hours. [OC]: Bridge to Janeway. We're approaching the dark matter nebula. No sir, I won't do it. Captain, I'm picking up some kind of energy pulses in the nebula, highly coherent, with a biomatrix. And they're heading this way. I don't know. Unless there are two aliens. How is that possible? But he's in Sickbay. He's brain dead. Captain, we're under attack. We're being bombarded by the energy beings. (Janeway activates the flash-scan. Tuvok is stunned and blinded, so Paris can take the phaser off him. Tuvok collapses before Paris can stun him. An energy leaves him and goes through the bulkhead. Paris runs a medical tricorder over Tuvok and nods to Janeway.) Looks like he's joined his friends outside. (Whumph.) I don't know if that'll work, Captain. Tuvok was navigating a complicated course. We could be going deeper into the nebula. I'm on it, Captain. (Whumph.) I'm not having any luck. Tuvok deleted the navigational logs as he went along. He wanted to make sure we didn't get out of here. Aye, Captain. (A picture of the medicine wheel is on the viewscreen.) We're passing the third planetoid now, Captain. The dark matter density is thinning. Reading normal space ahead. We've cleared the nebula, Captain. Main power coming back online. Shields at full strength, hull integrity normal. The alien beings are not pursuing. Captain's log, stardate 48735.9. We have returned to the co-ordinates where we ejected the warp core and have successfully retrieved it. Now we're hoping the Doctor will be able to successfully reintegrate Commander Chakotay's consciousness. [Sickbay] (Janeway and Torres are looking over the EMH's shoulders.)
We scanned the entire surface. No sign of them. They must still be underground, but I can't locate them there either. Take a look at this. This is the cave system nearest the beam-in coordinates as it appeared in our initial geological scan. And this is the same system now. This tunnel here has shifted to the west by almost seventy five degrees. Apparently so, Captain, but our initial scans didn't indicate tectonic activity of anywhere near that magnitude. Breadcrumbs. I'm sorry, Captain. What I mean to say is I think I can modify some subspace transponders which could be deployed along the Commander's path, kind of like If they're placed at regular intervals I believe they'll maintain a signal link with the ship and they could serve as a transporter relay in case we need to stage an emergency beam-out. Any sign of them? Delightful spot to get lost. Five? There were only three in the away team. This is solid granite, more than fifty metres. Commander! (Two Vidiians duck out of sight.) So far long range sensors haven't located any alien vessels near here. Captain, take a look at this. Using our tricorder data I've been able to scan the entire planet for the forcefield signature, and it looks like the field surrounds an area more than six hundred kilometres in circumference. Every reconfiguration I've tried has failed. Less than one micron. And they close up within a few seconds. So then it occurred to us. If we could narrow the transporters energy beam tightly enough, it might be possible to transport one of us through the microfissures. Initiating auto sequence.
The alien ship is entering visual range, Captain. The shuttle is hailing us, Captain. Channel open.
I've checked the transporter logs for the past month. There's no indication that the biofilter picked up anything suspicious. Right. Varmeliate fibre, whole green putillos and schplict. Grakel milk. I've looked at the logs, everything checked out. He's been at it since before I got here. Tuvok told him to use the micro-resonator. Sounds like a Tuvok estimate. Oh, you missed a spot. TUVOK Torres is working on it, but it's a long way from being ready. It couldn't even maintain life support at this point. Every system on the main grid is down. Communication, transporters, turbolifts and life support. It's having an affect, Captain. Temperature is at three hundred and forty Kelvins. Can we get the engines a little hotter? Okay, we're at three hundred and sixty Kelvins. Aye, Captain. [Cargo bay] (Chell and Dalby prise the door open and hold it with a metal bar. Dalby and Henley go to get Tuvok and Gerron.)
Are you the Emergency Medical Hologram? We've got wounded here. Yes. What? The programme must be malfunctioning. Let me see if I can reset the holographic projector. What did you do to him? Voyager encountered a subspace anomaly which created a kinoplasmic radiation surge throughout most of our computers. Unfortunately it happened while you were using the holodeck. Barclay was part of the original engineering team that designed your programme. He was in charge of testing your interpersonal skills. It's good to have you back, Doctor.
On all frequencies. No response. Picking up floating debris composed of duranium, magnesite and electroceramics. Also heavy traces of carbon residue. Transport complete. I'm picking up debris again. More duranium, magnesite, carbon residue. It's the remnants of another ship. Transport under way. [Engineering] And we found a residual energy displacement within the debris field that isn't consistent with the explosion itself. I've got a Kazon raider approaching at bearing two eight eight mark nine. They're moving into a lower orbit. Looks like they're intending to enter the atmosphere. Shall we take Voyager down?
Libby. This can't be happening. Libby, it's really you, isn't it? What? The date. What's the date? What day is today? So this isn't the past. It's the present. San Francisco. This can't be a dream, it's too real. It's too clear. So what does that leave. A holodeck? A hallucination? Some kind of trick? The last thing, I remember was piloting a shuttlecraft on my way back to Voyager. No, you can't be Libby. It's not possible. My name is Ensign Harry Kim of the Federation Starship Voyager. Where am I? Is this some sort of simulation? Danny? Danny Byrd? What is going on? [Outside Cosimo's Coffee Shop] (Harry leaves his apartment building in what according to a banner is the Mission District of the Old Town, which is having a festival on August 14. It is completely pedestrianised, with a subway entrance. Harry walks towards a coffee shop on the next intersection and the owner calls to him.) Thanks. What do you mean? Look, I know this is going to sound a little funny, but how long have I been coming to this coffee shop? Eight months. And you've seen me every day? Fiancée? We're getting married? I don't think you've ever had a morning quite like this one. (Another Starfleet officer calls to Harry.) Er, where? I, I'm not sure I can go. I'm not feeling very well. Maybe I should just go home. The what? I forgot to bring it. I'm sorry. Actually, sir, there is. Yes, sir. I'm very ill. I would like to continue this presentation at a later date. Guess I'm pretty good. Computer, display my service record. (reads) Graduated Starfleet Academy stardate 47918. Requested duty on USS Voyager. Request denied. Requested transfer to Starfleet Engineering Corps. Transfer approved. Starship design specialist. Awarded the Cochrane Medal of Excellence for outstanding advances in warp theory. Computer, access Starfleet Science Academy database. Have there been any temporal anomalies in the space-time continuum reported in the last forty eight hours? Computer, has there been any contact with the starship Voyager since it was lost in the Badlands? No problem. It's my ship, or at least I thought it was. Access Voyager crew manifest. Who was the operations officer on board? Danny. [Outside Cosimo's Coffee Shop] Oh, hi. I wasn't feeling too well, so I decided to come home. Thanks. Listen, I know this is going to sound strange, but I forgot to look at the street number when I left this morning, and I don't remember which building I live in. Could you No, like I said, I haven't been feeling well, and everything's kind of foggy. Thanks. It's just me, Libby. (Libby comes in.) Yeah. I'm fine. Nothing. Everything. I'm not sure what happened. Just tell me you love me. No. In fact, pretend I haven't heard you say it in a long time. Pretend that we haven't seen each other for months. Oh, on a starship, thousands of light years away. Yeah. We got a little lost. You can't imagine. No. No pleasure planet excursions, I'm afraid. Every day. Every nanosecond. Hmm? Orlando, Parsons, Peterson, Platt, Porter. Wait a minute. Paris. Where's Tom Paris? Computer, access service record of Starfleet officer Thomas Eugene Paris. (reads) Convicted of treason. Sentenced to eighteen months at the New Zealand Penal Settlement. Paroled on stardate 48702. Last reported whereabouts, Marseilles, France. Oh, I couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd catch up on some work. (He turns off the screen.) There's nothing going on, okay? Libby, it's hard to explain right now. And I do want to tell you, but I need you to trust me. All right. This, this is going to sound a little crazy from your perspective, but I am not who you think I am. All of this, it's not supposed to be happening. I don't belong here. You don't understand. What I'm trying to say is, I'm from another reality. That's right. I know. I'm scared too. I will, but there's someone else I need to see first. Marseilles, France. I've got to see Paris. It's a long story. Trust me, okay? Tom. You don't know me, do you? No. Try Voyager. You know about the mission to the Badlands? But you said no? That Ferengi, was he trying to sell you Lobi crystals? Because I was there. In my reality, anyway. Tom, I know this is going to sound crazy, but I was on Voyager and so were you. You never got into a bar fight with that Ferengi. You stopped him from selling me Lobi crystals. And you did lead us into the Badlands. Something's happened. Somehow, reality has been changed. A temporal anomaly, an alien influence, I can't explain how. All I know is that it's true. I was in a shuttlecraft heading back to Voyager, and then I woke up here on Earth. Come with me to Starfleet Headquarters. Help me run a computer simulation of what happened on that shuttle. You're the best pilot I've ever seen, and if anyone can figure it out, it's you. What are you talking about? It's not a game! You once told me that you used to treat life like one big game. Rules, players, winners, losers. You never took any of it seriously until you lost. You also told me you were afraid of what would happen to you if you didn't take Captain Janeway up on her offer. Now I see why. A loser and a drunk. (Paris tries to punch Kim, and ends up with his arm behind his back, pushed down onto the pool table.) I guess in this reality, that's all you'll ever be. (Someone just like Cosimo watches Kim leave.) [Kim's apartment] (Two Starfleet security officers are waiting as Kim enters.) What's going on? Why does everyone say relax when they're about to do something terrible? Which is what exactly? I haven't forged anything. And I can explain. I don't think I have a choice at the moment. I'll see you later. [Starfleet Headquarters] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Like what? That's crazy. I am Harry Kim. Check my DNA if you don't believe me. Run a microcellular scan of my cerebral cortex to see if my memory's been altered. Everything I'm saying is true. I went to look up an old friend. I tried to tell him what's happened. I wanted his help. To figure out how I got here and how I can get back. There must be a temporal anomaly somewhere or. You think I'm a spy, don't you. You think I'm working for the Maquis. That's it! I'm not answering any more questions until I have legal counsel. Yes, Admiral. You could say that. Who are you? Well, you've got to get me back. What? Well, that's not good enough. There's got to be something we can do. Where is this time stream of yours? Maybe I can use it to get back. What do you mean? I guess I'll have to take that chance, because somehow I have to get back. What about Danny Byrd? He isn't so lucky. And Tom Paris? Fate wasn't so kind to him. No, it isn't supposed to be this way. I'm supposed to be on Voyager in the Delta Quadrant. And that's where I have to go. Thanks. Libby. I didn't hear you come in. No. I'm just trying to get back to where I belong. Look, I know the last few days must have been pretty tough on you. It's still me. The guy who was in your seat at the Ktarian music festival. The guy who took three weeks to work up the courage to ask you out. The guy who still wakes up in the middle of the night and says your name out loud, hoping you'll answer back. I'm not trying to get away from you. I love you. And I promise you, I want to stay here more than anything. But I can't. I don't think anybody knows me as well as you do, so you of all people should know that once I've made up my mind about something, I can't let it go. In some ways, it'd be a lot easier to forget about Voyager, just settle in here and build a life. But that wouldn't be me. You wouldn't be getting the Harry Kim you fell in love with. Does that make any sense? (The anklet starts beeping.) The tampering alarm. Security will be here any second. I'd better go. I promise you, I'm going to try to get back. It may take a while, and I may not make it, but I swear, I will try. (Security beams into the alcove. Kim gets out onto the fire escape. Libby closes the window and stops the security officers from following.) What are you doing here? So, how did you find me? Yeah. Starfleet thinks I'm a Maquis spy. You're the last person I expected to help me. Call me Harry. You always did. Wait. I found a way to get back to my reality. The problem is I'll need a ship to do it. I think I have access to a runabout, but I'm going to have to break it out of Spacedock. Know anyone who's qualified? I have an office at Starfleet Headquarters. I think we can access the runabout launch codes from there. Main complex, level six, subsection forty seven. Let's do it. [Kim's office] The alien said that if I recreate the conditions of the accident and fly into the time stream, there's a chance I might be able to get back into my reality. He couldn't give me any guarantees. Almost there. I've bypassed the runabout's security lockouts. Hold on. I almost got it. (Security enter.)  Overriding initialisation codes. Main power coming online. Powering up main fusion reactor. Warp core and main propulsion are online. I'm entering the coordinates of the time stream into the main computer. We've got a starship on our tail. Nebula class. They're going to try to do everything they can to stop us. They think we're trying to steal this prototype. Shields down to seventy percent. Fifty percent. (Bang! Sparks.) Twenty nine percent. It is, but it looks like they haven't finished working on the defensive systems. In fact, some of the safety interlocks aren't even in place. A few more of those hits and I don't. (Bang!) We're losing antimatter containment. Attempting to stabilise the field. The containment field is weakening. We could be looking at a core breach. If we can't shake them off, maybe we can slow them down a little. This runabout is equipped with tetryon plasma warp nacelles. Tetryon plasma emits multiflux gamma radiation. It disrupts subspace. Exactly. Venting drive plasma. All right. Let's recreate my shuttle accident. I think I was travelling at one hundred and forty thousand kph. Look, that was another lifetime. I'm doing the best I can. Now, I also remember running a polaron scan. The scanning beam was sweeping at a radius of half a million kilometres. No, wait. A quarter million. Activating polaron scan. That should do it. Did we miss it? I have to get into that time stream. Wait a minute, I'm forgetting something. The emergency transport. The last thing I remember hearing was Captain Janeway's comm voice. She said she was trying to beam me off the shuttle. That's it. I've got to beam off the ship. We have to recreate all the conditions of the accident, including that one. We just lost antimatter containment. Twenty five seconds to core breach. Not yet. The core is breaching. We've got to shut it down first. In fifteen seconds this ship is going to explode. You'll be killed. And if I'm wrong, if this doesn't work, you'll be blown up right here. Kim here, Captain. Stand by. [Bridge] KIM A time stream? I've already been briefed, Commander. I owe you one. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

That was me. I keep hearing my mother say, practice, Harry, practice. So I ate Neelix's food for a week and used my replicator rations. Well, I've only had it for a few days, and I don't think Different? Why? Something bothering you, Paris? What's new? What's new? Kes! In your arms? Paris, you didn't. If you ask me, I say you enjoy it. Only thing that makes sense. You've been doing the same thing to yourself your whole life. Setting yourself up for rejection. You must enjoy playing the part. There's an old Chinese expression. Stay out of harm's way. If it works, use it. That's a pessimistic view.  Listen, why don't we take in a holodeck programme later? A Moliere comedy. That'll cheer you up. What do you want to do? But that's rude. Hair pasta? That is just an expression, isn't it? Have a nice lunch. (Paris sits with his back to Kes, and smiles at Neelix. Kes leaves. Neelix goes over to Paris.) However, we have been running computer simulations to determine if the EM disturbances follow any specific pattern. Our data analysis suggests that there may be occasional atmospheric windows that would allow us to get through. We should see one every thirty hours or so, but they may only last for a matter of minutes. I can't be sure yet. We're doing everything possible. The transporter just doesn't want to work in that atmosphere. How are you doing? You had a every right to be. Guilty? Why? Look. You know if there was any way to land that shuttle, Tom Paris got it down. I'm sure they'll both be fine. They're professionals. They're powering down their weapons systems. The EM disturbance patterns match the computer simulations. I'd say we'll get a shot at an atmospheric window in about fifty three minutes. I think so. I'll try to get you a better one, Captain. Coordinates entered. The atmospheric window is forming, Captain, thirty degrees off the predicted co-ordinates. Nine minutes. Ready. The atmospheric window is at full aperture, Captain. We should have at least seventeen minutes before it starts to close. Nine minutes, twenty seconds. One minute, ten seconds, max. [Outside the cave]
Not exactly. The holoemitters would be set up in certain key areas, the Bridge, Engineering. We'll be able to transfer him to those locations. I have the holoprojector online. We're ready to start. Initiating transfer. Here he comes. (The EMH appears, six inches tall.) Just a small oversight. No pun intended. Maybe a couple of hours. I wonder why he wouldn't let us see his face. We found several of them in storage. We've been reconfiguring them one by one. I think we should check out the imaging systems on the holodeck. There might be a simple malfunction. I show it on a direct intercept course. I'm getting them too. Residual energy displacements. Two discrete readings. One off the port bow, one off starboard. Two ships decloaking. They're turning back for another strike.  There's something weird going on, Commander. I'm not reading any life signs on the two ships that just decloaked. Looks like the ships are automated. They're being controlled by the Bothan ship. Commander, the three ships are manoeuvring to surround us. The ships are powering their weapons, preparing to fire. We've got damage on all decks. Reports of injuries. I see my girlfriend, Libby. I'm trying, Captain. It won't terminate. Captain, I'll do it. Running a multiphasic scan.
Showing no life signs. That is an unusually high EM reading for a natural occurrence. Doc, I don't feel so good.  You'd think with warp technology, they would have encountered other alien life before now. What seems to be the problem? I'm reading a electrical storms forming all around us. The barometric pressure is continuing to fall. We're looking at monsoon conditions out there. (The storm is building on the surface. Chakotay explores and finds a cave, but lightning strikes are guarding the entrance. He takes a chance and manages to dodge inside.) Captain, it's a cyclone. Could we go to low warp under these conditions? I'm showing an eight percent boost in the engines. Impact in twenty seconds.  Impact in ten seconds. (The shaking suddenly stops.) The storms have completely dissipated. There's not a cloud in the sky.
Spatial resolution at maximum. Boosting the signal gain. The configuration is similar. So is the surface composition, but it's only about one tenth the size. No, but I am picking up over two thousand carbon based life forms. They appear to be. Wait a second. Confirming. Captain, they're Ocampa. Shields are holding. Captain, there's a subspace rupture forming directly ahead. We're losing hull integrity.
Kim to the Captain. I'm picking up several vessels converging on the Nistrim's location.
The anti-matter reaction rate is down to twelve percent. If it drops below nine, the plasma injectors will lock up and we'll never be able to re-initialise the nacelles. If we're going to reduce our power demands even further, we're going to have to drop the shields. All other systems are already offline. Life support is at minimal. You asked for options? That's our last one. That helped. It's only a matter of time. There's nothing more we can do without the tellerium. Re-routing emergency power to Transporter room two and energising. (Neelix and the vial are beamed into Engineering.) Unlock the control conduit. Keep an eye on the flow rate. Reaction rate has stabilised at thirteen percent. Up to fifteen, eighteen. Maybe. Once the rate is up to normal, we'll try getting the warp drive back online. Then we'll see if there was any damage. Commander, I think we're ready to give the engines a try. I'm opening the plasma injectors. Warp engines are back online. All systems normal. There is a periodic fluctuation in the shield's energy pattern. I'm working on a way to take advantage of it. We can't locate the away team from here. The detention level is subterranean and the rock is too dense for our sensors to penetrate. You'll have to look for them after you beam into the prison. We may still be able to surprise them, even if they do see us coming. We can modify the main deflector to send out dozens of radion beams which should penetrate the prison shields. One of them will carry our transporter signal but the sensor net won't be able to distinguish which one, so the Mokra won't know the exact location we're beaming to. That's the best head start I can give you. I can do it right now. Deflector ready, Commander. Sending out the first volley. It's working. They're getting through the shields. Transporter room two, synchronise your confinement beams to (Boom!) That came from the surface. Shields at ninety percent. It's a precision hit right to the source of the beams. Main deflector is now offline. We're being hailed from the surface. Commander. There's a disruption in the shields around the prison. Wish I could take credit for it, but it's coming from inside the prison. Yes, but the Mokra will detect our transport. Shields at sixty percent. Minor damage on deck fourteen. They're firing again. No effect. Direct hit to the port nacelle. Two more coming in. [Prison complex] There's no sign of them. Wait! Set a course bearing two one nine mark four seven. There's a large magnetic storm over the northern magnetic pole. It's giving our sensors some trouble, it should do same for theirs. Exactly. If we maintain our position directly above the storm, their sensor net may not be able to keep an accurate lock on our position. The storm's already dissipating. A few more minutes? Captain, are you all right?
What about an interface with an EPS power conduit? Maybe we're overloading it's systems. Got it. Five seconds at three percent, on your mark. We'll have to watch the pressure on the connectors. Flux capacitance is spiking intermittently, but I don't think that's a problem. It's not a cyborg. It's completely robotic. No organic components of any kind. But I'm not detecting any pathways for transmitting information. Maybe it needs to interface with a outside source. We don't know that. It may just be some kind of recording. B'Elanna, we don't even know if it can see you, much less understand a word you're saying. We've been trying for hours. We need a break. The EPS charge should hold till morning. If you're staying, I'm staying. You may think you're tougher than everybody else, B'Elanna Torres, but I can go without sleep just as long as you can. If you insist. But let me know if you come up with anything, Lieutenant. Chief Engineers log, supplemental. I've tried thirteen different methods of reinitialising the robot's power source and I'm still having no luck, so I've decided to go to the mess hall to recharge my own declining energy reserves. [Mess hall] Plasma injector is sealed. Initiating plasma flow. Got it. I'm taking it to thirty percent. Thirty five percent. But it needs more plasma. Aye, Captain. I can't block it. The patterns are already in the buffer. They're gone, Captain. I can't get a lock on her. They're not responding. Channel open. They heard us all right. They're just not answering. Re-routing power to aft shields. Initiating emergency containment field. We've lost artificial gravity on deck eight. They're hailing us, Captain. And last but not least, the dilithium matrix is destabilised, so we can't get the warp engines running. How does seventy two hours sound? Our transporters could get the job done. No sign of organic life aboard that ship either. The second ship is hailing us. We're still an hour away at best. Aye, Captain.
Having no trouble penetrating the crust, Captain. [Transporter room] JANEWAY Captain, there are no stars outside. Captain, I don't believe this, but according to my readings, we're being attacked by protons. We've been reduced to subatomic proportions.
It looks like the Kazon have retreated, Captain. Yes ma'am. [Sickbay] Captain, you can't be serious. This goes against everything Why don't we just contact Seska and form an alliance with her? I don't see any trace of him. Shields at full power. Captain. Ships. Kazon ships on long range sensors, closing fast. They're hailing us, Captain. I'll put it on screen.
What about a duranium alloy? We could try using it to reinforce We've hit a wall. Neelix, it would take too long to Nothing in the universe can go warp ten. It's a theoretical impossibility. In principle, if you were ever to reach warp ten, you'd be travelling at infinite velocity. If Voyager achieved warp ten, we could be home in as long as it takes to push a button. The problem is, every time we simulate crossing the transwarp threshold, the nacelles get torn off the ship. No, the simulations don't indicate any kind of subspace stress on the nacelles. What do you mean? The hull of the shuttle is made of tritanium alloy. At the speeds we're talking about, that alloy could depolarise. That means we just have to set up a depolarisation matrix around the fuselage. After that, we'll analyse the shuttle's sensor logs. Once we know it's safe to travel at transwarp, we'll try a more extended flight. Aye, Captain.  Yes! Captain, he just disappeared off sensors. Nothing. I can't find him. He's gone. (Later.) I've done three full sensor sweeps. No sign of the shuttle within five parsecs. If that's true, then he could be anywhere in the universe. He's alive, but his life signs are weak.  Acknowledged. I'm downloading the logs into the Engineering computer core. [Engineering]  Phaser discharge on deck six. I'm still having trouble with internal sensors. It came from somewhere between sections twenty one and twenty seven alpha. Commander, someone's depressurising shuttlebay two. There's a launch in progress. It's offline. I've got main power back. They're approaching warp nine point nine. No, and they're still accelerating. Warp nine point nine seven. I've lost them, Commander. They've gone to transwarp. (Janeway wakes up and experiences the wonder of transwarp travel for herself.) First Officer's log, stardate 49373.4. It's taken us three days to locate the shuttle. It appears to have dropped out of transwarp in an uninhabited star system. [Sickbay]
What kind of stakes? Wait a minute. Are you saying he deliberately let me win? I won that game, and I'll beat you again. A week's worth. I'm in too. Very funny. Two, by my count. Ten percent of the day's action. The only one who wins every day is you. Thanks a lot. [Brig]
I'm not reading any organic material in the debris field. It must have been an unmanned vessel. Possibly a probe. Captain, the wreckage is composed primarily of duritanium polyalloy. How did it get here? I think I've got it on long range sensors. Got it. Elevated neutrino levels. Locking in coordinates. It's within visual range. We're being hailed by the missile. Reading an energy build up in it's reactor. It should overload in about thirty seconds. Wait a minute. There's a plasma surge coming from it's core. What the hell? (Whumph!) It sent a plasma burst along the tachyon beam into our main power system. We've got EPS relays burnt out all over the ship. Don't worry, we'll find a way to get you back over there. You couldn't expect to guess every move it made. It's only as smart as you made it. And I bet it doesn't spend much time worrying about what it could have done differently. Channel open, Captain. Audio only. Shields are holding. Damage reported on decks three and four. Repair crews responding. Captain, I've broken through the interference. I'm not sure how. We have communications. Checking on transporter signal. I have a lock on her. Captain.
See you later. (King Abdullah of Jordan leaves.) Uh, yes, yes, I did. I'm not sure I care for all the frosting. [Turbolift] Deck four. Recipes, music, jugglers. It's sort of like a steady diet of dessert, which is fine, but pretty soon you want some meat and potatoes. When I was in school, I was editor of the Academy newspaper for a year. I monitored subspace transmissions. I got reports on some of the first activity by the Maquis against the Cardassians. I wrote an editorial about it, and the students became polarised on the issue. They debated the pros and cons, and gained an insight into the entire history of the political rebellion. Now, that's the power of journalism. I didn't tell them. It's the job of a journalist to be independent. Captain, do you think? I mean, it's possible Tom might change his mind to come back. Maybe you shouldn't replace him so quickly. Captain, message coming in from the Talaxian convoy.  We're in transporter range, Captain. It's the Kazon ship, Captain. Captain, we've lost weapons. It looks like the phaser arrays have been disabled from Engineering. Weapons are back online, Captain. Yes, ma'am. (Voyager disables the Kazon ship's engines.) [Engineering] (Neelix locks down the plasma leak and lowers the forcefields.)
According to the bioscanner, it's a Vidiian female. No response. Aye, Captain. [Sickbay]
Four days? We hit some kind of subspace turbulence as we were coming out of the plasma drift. I can't tell if (The power goes down.) We're losing main power. Switching to backup power. Captain, three EPS conduits just ruptured in Engineering. They took heavy casualties. [Sickbay] (Bang!)  She's right. The main sensor array is offline. Not a single burst was fired. Our antimatter supply is too low. There's just not enough power to go (Whumph, bang!) Captain, I've been working on a way to enhance our portable forcefield generators. It might be enough to seal that breach.  Jefferies tube twelve runs right over the breach. If we can get close enough, we should be able to set up a portable containment field.  Here it is. The breach is directly below us. (Kim opens the bulkhead and goes down the ladder.) Just give me a minute. [Sickbay] Hold on. My minute isn't up yet. (The breach opens and Harry grabs a ladder rung to stop himself being sucked out. Torres climbs down.) You're welcome. But you should also thank the Doctor. It was his counterpart who saved her from the Vidiians. I really didn't have time to ask. Thank you, I think. I'm not sure. I mean, this isn't really my ship, and you're not really my captain, and yet you are, and there's no difference. But I know there's a difference. Or is there? It's all a little weird.
There's heavy solar flare activity. It's causing electrodynamic disturbance throughout the system. (Torres and Neelix enter.) The Drayan ship still hasn't responded to our hails. They're receiving it, they're just not answering. We've also had some indications of life signs on the surface. A while ago there seemed to be four of them. Now we can only distinguish two. There must be at least twenty people on the surface. I can't tell if the two life forms we detected before are still there. Captain, there's a break in the turbulence. I'm picking up a comm. signal. There's nothing I can do, Captain. The signal's breaking up. There's no structural damage, some power fluctuations. He should be able to take off. I've been studying the energy signature of the Drayan shuttles. They're using some kind of dielectric field to protect them from the turbulence. It won't be very stable.
Sorry! It's the darn fluid conduits running through the walls. They conduct sound. You'd think when they designed this thing, they would have Where am I supposed to practice? Bad acoustics. We couldn't do that. Could we? Look, I'm trying to prepare for an important performance. No, Susan Nicoletti and I have been working on a new orchestral programme for the holodeck. Not when she plays the oboe. EM signature indicates that a major solar flare occurred here nineteen years ago. It did a lot more than that. They were hit by magnetic storms and extreme levels of radiation. The biosphere seems to be recovering. Scanning the settlement. There's evidence of advanced technology, warp reactors, subspace transmitters, but no lifesigns. Captain, I'm picking up something from the surface. I think we're being hailed. There aren't. I scanned the entire surface. It must be an automated signal. I would think so, Captain, unless. Checking below the surface. Nothing one kilometre down. Two kilometres. Wait a minute. I think I've got something two point three kilometres down. Extremely faint bio-signatures. Three humanoids. Not at this distance. But I am picking up two more humanoids at the same location who are dead. Not that I can see. I'm not reading any pathway failures in the hibernation pods. The circuitry all seems to be functioning. Looks like their brains are interconnected in a complex sensory system controlled by this computer. According to these indicators, Captain, their minds are active. The encephalographic readings suggest they're dreaming, but there's some kind of interactivity with the computer. It's not just scanning their brain functions, it's sending a data stream back to them as well. For the moment, it's as good a theory as any. Exactly. This subroutine has remained available to these people since it was activated four years ago. It's literally an escape hatch. No. That's what's so odd about this. As far as I can tell, it's working perfectly. I don't know. The Doc is right. I have no idea how to disconnect them without causing neural damage. I just don't know the system well enough. We could add a backup life support system, using our own computer and medical stasis technology. How do you feel? These must be characters generated by the computer, but I don't see our people. Excuse me. We're trying to find some friends. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bump into you. Yes, we are. We're not getting very far. (A very large figure with a mask of giant teeth stops them.) That's right. Three of them. You've got it. (They try to fight the acrobats and dancer, but to no avail.) Are you a lifeform? Or some kind of computer virus that penetrated this system? Disappear. Because you're characters created by this programme, and once their minds stop interacting with the system, you won't exist anymore. The two we found dead both suffered from massive heart attacks. You scared them to death. [Cargo Bay 1] That would be a mistake. You'd be missing an opportunity. Fine. So you know. You'll also know that what I'm about to tell you is the truth. You'd be smart to let one of us go. This is your chance to send the outside world a message. To tell them your demands. Otherwise, you run the risk of our people shutting down the whole system. Because I promise you, they won't let us stay in here for long. (The characters go into a huddle.) How did this happen? It's almost as though he can read our minds. He seems to know what we're thinking. Look, we don't have time for regret. My people are working on a way, right now, to get us out of here. And we have to help them if we can. Why does he do it? This is not reality. It's an illusion. Like the man said, The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. No. The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. No! (Someone takes the Clown's hand and lifts it away from Kim.) Starting to feel better. I don't know that for sure. I'd rather die than spend my life in here with you. She knows that. Yes. The captain would sacrifice herself to save the hostages.
Try narrowing the annular confinement beam. Let's try it again. Kim to Away team. Sorry for the delay. We're ready to bring you back. Energise. Tuvok or Neelix? Abort. Kim to Security. Intruder alert, Transporter Room One. Identify yourself. That's right. Possibly. I'll know more after we've run a diagnostic on the bio-filters and transporter logs. According to the transporter logs, they were optimal at the time of transport. It was a perfectly routine beam-out sequence. No anomalies, no power overloads, no malfunctions. And if the enzymes that cause symbiogenesis interacted with their DNA while they were in the matter stream, it might have caused their patterns to merge. Acknowledged. Energising. (Kes, Kim and Tuvix peer at the strange admixture that appears on the transporter pad.) [Sickbay] The genetic codes of the chrysanthemum and the clematis are so scrambled that the targeting scanners can't recognise the original patterns. How can I help you, Doc? Well, I think so, but we'd have to modify the molecular imaging scanners and find a way to compensate for the higher levels of radiation. Wait a second. What's going on? This is about Tuvix, isn't it? I'm on my way. [Sandrine's] Instead of barium, we've come up with a radioisotope that attaches itself to the DNA of one of the merged species, but not the other. You see these? They used to be a single merged flower.
I know how they feel. B'Elanna, I've been talking with some of the Starfleet crew. They're not happy about what happened. I was wondering, how are the Maquis taking it? Then why don't we do something about it? I don't know. It seems like we shouldn't just accept this.  Captain Tuvok? I'm picking up a convoy on long-range sensors. It's Vidiian, sir. Approximately one point five light years. Sir, the Vidiians. They're within hailing range. We could ask them if they know anything about the Captain's illness. Yes, but it's not like we went out of our way to find them. We would just be taking advantage of an opportunity that's presented itself. Sir, how can we turn our backs on this chance to do something? Don't we have to try? Don't we owe that to the Captain and the Commander? What's wrong with the rest of you? You know I'm right. We have a chance to help them. How can we ignore that? Sure. Have a seat. That's what I think, but Captain Tuvok's made his decision. Two ensigns and a crewman won't change his mind. Really. Come on. (They go to Torres' table.) Did you hear what happened this morning? Three weeks ago, you said if I had an idea about what to do, you'd listen. Have a seat, Neelix. We might have come up with the biggest morale booster you could possibly imagine. [Tuvok's quarters] Can I have a moment, sir? Yes, sir, but this is important. First of all, I want to apologise for my behaviour yesterday. I'd like to suggest a plan. It's something a lot of people have helped to develop. We have two big bargaining points when it comes to dealing with the Vidiians. First, there's the woman Doc treated, Denara Pel. They were very close, so I'm sure she'd help us if she could. And then there's B'Elanna. Her DNA might lead to a cure for the phage. We could offer them some, in exchange for their help with a cure for the Captain and Chakotay. Sir, I think you should know how many people on this ship disagree with you. Everyone I talk to thinks we should give this a try. But if we're willing to take that risk in order to help the Captain Yes, sir. [Outside the shelter] (Chakotay is smoothing some wood.)  Sir, the Vidiians are hailing us. I have them, sir. Approximately twenty hours. Got something. Vidiian ship, bearing three two five mark five. They aren't responding. Trying on alternating frequencies. I've got it. Now a third. None of them are answering hails and their weapons are powered. Shields down to fifty eight percent. Firing. Torpedoes armed. Aye, sir. [Engineering] Firing torpedo. (KaBOOM.) The Vidiian ships are all disabled, sir. They're not pursuing.
 Captain, we're being hailed on a subspace frequency. It looks like a Kazon signal, Captain. Captain. I could programme the deflector grid to make it look like we have help on the way. I'll show you what I mean. Excuse me, Doctor. Exactly. This is how we'd look to the enemy's sensors. If we generate multiple decoy images like these, the Kazon would think that ships are coming toward us. We could create as many as we want. We're going to use up a lot of our power reserves trying to pull it off. Just a signal, Captain. No response to our hails. Visual range. Showing one life sign, adult Kazon male. He's in critical condition. Plus, we confirmed nitrogen tetroxide fumes were in the cabin. If all this was part of a Kazon scheme, he had to be willing to breathe poison for hours before we got there. No. Signature is Kazon. Shields are holding. Minor damage to secondary command processors on deck twelve. EPS power supplies and isolinear controllers are offline. No casualties, though. They're coming at our starboard ventral again. Our shields there haven't been repaired yet. We're going to sustain more damage to the secondary command processors. Control units are responding, Captain. Deck twelve is in shambles. At least no one was hurt. The secondary command processors are non-functional. We'll have to rebuild them. I'd say we're looking at two days work if we're not attacked again. Echo displacement ready, Captain. Activating deflector grid. They should be seeing the same thing on their scanners. Ten ships with Talaxian signatures. Shields are holding. No damage. Shields at ninety percent. (In his quarters, Teirna starts chanting.)  Four Kazon ships dead ahead, but they're dividing their fire, Captain. The holograms are working. Shields at eight five percent and holding. Minor damage reported deck fourteen. I'm reading a massive discharge on deck eight. We've lost a primary plasma conduit. I'm showing power failures all over the ship. (The holographic ships are destroyed.) [Engineering] Shields at seventy percent and falling. Starboard targeting scanners are offline. Shuttle is clear. So far, so good. Voyager to Paris. Please respond. Tom, can you hear me? I've lost contact with the shuttle. Shields at thirty percent. They're buckling. (Big bangs. Consoles explode.) The driver coil assembly has been destroyed. Impulse engines are offline. Maybe Tom's shuttle got through. Gamma team. Captain. How do you like your eggs? And that's not all. Cucumbers, or something like them. There are vines full of them two hours from here. There you go. (Torres takes it to Chakotay and puts it by the friction hole in the log. The spinning stick finally makes it catch fire. A local watches his warm his hands by the flames. Later -) Those tremors seem to be getting stronger. Do you really think Commander Chakotay would go in there after what happened to Hogan? A couple of phaser blasts would do the trick. Captain! (There is a nearby volcanic eruption.) Suder? We thought he was killed during the initial attack. All propulsion and navigational systems are functioning within normal parameters, Captain.
Then we'll bring scanning equipment down and investigate for ourselves. I will make a full report to our Captain. I'm sure you'll be hearing from her. And Captain, the implant also contains a homing beacon which we'll be able to pick up no matter how far into the sanctuary you go. Just tap it like a comm. badge and we'll transport you immediately.
You have an incoming message from the Magistrate.
Based on the residual neutrino levels, I'd estimate it's been at least six months since the wormhole's last appearance. Aye, Captain. If they've got a replicator, it could mean the wormhole leads to the Alpha Quadrant, and that someone's travelled through it.  We've been able to confirm that the wormhole does lead to the Alpha Quadrant. So we were thinking, if you can't bring the ship to the wormhole, bring the wormhole to the ship. We've detected a subspace instability at our current location that's a result of the wormhole's last appearance here. We haven't figured that part out yet. [Temple square] (The deal has been done.) Apparently, but we've confirmed what nobody knew at the time. The wormhole is fixed in the Alpha Quadrant. But in the Delta Quadrant, it jumps around. It turned out to be worthless. So far everything is going according to plan, but it's tricky. There are a hundred factors that could deflect it from this sector. A gravimetric shift, a solar flare. Aye, Captain.  Initiating photon bursts. [Town square] (Three bright lights appear in the sky.) Boosting power to the annular confinement beam. [Temple] CROWD Activating emergency containment field. I'm trying, but the targeting scanners are out of phase.  Captain, the Ferengi are emitting a graviton pulse. It's throwing the targeting scanners off again. Not only that, it's destabilising the wormhole. (The ship shudders again.) Captain, the entrance to the wormhole is moving. The Ferengi graviton pulse must have increased its rotational momentum. The Ferengi graviton pulse knocked the wormhole completely off its subspace axis. It's jumping erratically now on both ends. There are none.
It's a class seventeen nebula. I'm detecting standard amounts of hydrogen, and helium, and seven thousand parts per million of sirillium. I checked all the sensor logs. There's no sign of anything emanating from the nebula that would have affected Tuvok or Voyager. No, it's a standard class seventeen. I don't see any connection between this nebula and the one the Excelsior saw eighty years ago. This one's a class seventeen, while theirs was an eleven. Both contain trace amounts of sirillium, but that's about all. To the naked eye, but not to sensors. Technically, they're very different. You know, I've been talking to the doctor, and he tells me it's not unusual for a repressed memory to resurface because of a smell or a visual detail. Maybe the visual similarities between the two nebulas simply triggered Tuvok's memory of the Excelsior. Who knows that goes on in a Vulcan's mind. Maybe there is no connection. And going back to the memory of the Excelsior was just an accident, a stray thought Tuvok was having because of the similarities between the two nebulas. What do they say? Nothing? You mean he falsified his logs? No replicators, no holodecks. You know, ever since I took Starfleet history at the academy, I always wondered what it would be like to live in those days.
Tom. (Paris punches Kim in the stomach. He goes down.) Wait. This is a mistake. I don't belong here! Did you have to hit me so hard? Thanks for the tip. Is there any food? How long is that? The Akritirians interrogated me. When I wouldn't confess to the bombing, they dragged me in front of a judge. He said you'd already confessed for the both of us, then he pronounced me guilty. We've got to explain to somebody that there's been a mistake. A guard, the warden. A prison without guards. Can I have some more? Take it easy. The what? (Paris shows him a small metal object embedded in the back of his skull.) What is it? What do you think it's for? We could try taking them out. Let's get something straight first. The next time you take a swing at me, I'm hitting back. (The klaxon sounds.) What's that? He's dead.  What took you so long? I've been back at least half an hour. I guess I am. How about a seven course dinner? I suppose you didn't find any food. I take it that's a no. Great. All we need are the Delaney sisters and we could make a day of it. If you mean an escape route, I ran into nothing but solid walls. Question is, how do we get into it without getting fried by that forcefield? You saw what happened to the man who reached inside. It's worth a try. Come on, come on, come on. Damn! I can't think! I can't concentrate! Or how about shrimp with fettran sauce, flambé noodles and fudge ripple pudding. Right now, I'm so hungry I could eat a bowl of Neelix's leola root stew. I'm ready to give it a try. So far, so good. (Kim touches the forcefield with the pipe, and gets thrown backwards.) A pipe. Come on, Tom. (Paris knocks Pit down, and gets stabbed by another prisoner.) Tom! (Kim breaks free and goes to Paris' help, swinging the metal pipe.) Back off! Back off! Back off! Back off! Hang on. I'm getting you out of here. We've got to get him to a doctor. You can make it. Just a few more steps and we'll be back to the shelter. Yeah. I'll take care of it. What? Quiet. (A man comes out of their hovel.) Hey! What are you doing in there? This place is ours. Okay, here's the deal. My boots for some clean cloth, a litre of water, two of those food cakes and my friend gets to stay in there until he's better. What about the rest of it? Just tell me what you want for the food and the bandages, okay? I can't trade the pipe. I'll take you with me. I know a way out of this place. The chute. With this pipe, I can disable the forcefield. With a little luck, we can make it to the surface. What are you staring at? Neither. And I'll prove it to you. Then we have a deal? I can handle him. Try to get some rest. What deal? I think the clamp must really be starting to make you crazy. I've got to go. Damn it! How do I do that? I feel like there's a million fire ants in my brain. How? I'd rather use my energy to work on getting out of here. I guess so. Okay. Sure. Whatever you say. Yes. I plan to be out of here before it even becomes an issue. Go ahead. Touch it. (The chute forcefield is neutralised. Zio pushes open the iris and Kim leads the way up the chute.) [Top of the chute] Some kind of hatch. (Kim wedges himself safely and starts rubbing at the hatch.) How are you feeling? Next time I'll try not to wake you. Not yet, but we're very close. It's just a matter of time, so you've got to hang in there, okay? Easy, Tom. You got stabbed, remember? One of the prisoners. I'm trying to change your bandage. Please! I'm trying to help you! Tom! Tom, give me the pipe. We need it to get out of here, remember? It's okay. Let me take it. You're going to be okay. Yeah? Close your eyes. [Outside Zio's hovel] (Later -) No. Shut up! The chute leads to a docking port, right? Some kind of ship must come to drop off food, drop off new prisoners. So maybe we could get aboard the ship. I know we could do it. We'd have the element of surprise. If we could hold them off, distract them, just for a few minutes, I could establish our location, get a message to Voyager, and they could get us out of here. We'll need weapons. I don't want to read your crazy manifesto. Now, are you going to help me or not?  Listen! Listen to me, everybody! This is important. I've got something to say. Something you'll want to hear. It's what you've been waiting for. I've found a way out of here. There is! Through the chute! I've been inside! Listen! We have to work together! They'd like us all to kill each other, but we have to cooperate. If we do, we can get out of here. Space. It's the truth! We can escape, if we work together! (Someone throws a missile at Kim, that hits him on the head.) [Zio's hovel] (Paris is pulling the wires off the pipe.) What the hell are you doing? You've ruined it! You He's my best friend! That's not true! Quiet! What the hell are you talking about? You're insane. I don't need your protection! I'm not a killer. If that's what it takes to stay alive, then I'd rather die. (He drops the knife.) This man is my friend. Nobody touches him!  Captain. He needs help. (More security men have arrived.) Zio was right. I guess so. Tom Tom, listen to me. I, I almost killed you. I was ready to hit you with the pipe. Don't you remember? So what's for dessert? What about the fudge ripple pudding?
Sure. I'd be happy to help. Well, if we're done for the night, maybe we could go get something to eat. So, I guess it'll just be the three of us. So what exactly is this big surprise? What happened to the tables and chairs? Maybe later. (Kim goes to sit next to Jessen. They are all listening to a man running his fingers over a large hemisphere in a piece of carved wood, similar in size and shape to a ukulele.) I know B'Elanna and I trust her. It can't hurt to listen.
If this is any indication of their borders, it's a huge area of space, hundreds of sectors. If we were to go around it it would take months. Tom and B'Elanna hit a sensor net as they crossed the border. We have to figure we'll run into it when we try to cross. But there are ways around sensor nets. Their sensor net uses a series of interlaced tachyon beams. If we adjust our shields to refract those beams around the ship we can slip across without appearing to have disrupted the net. I'm ready whenever Lieutenant Torres is. Engineering, initiate the refraction pulse.  [Engineering] The net is registering as intact. If those vessels get the same reading they won't suspect a thing. I think we did it, Captain. Like a snake through the tube! Captain, sensors indicate a resonance particle wave. It's dampening our warp field. We're losing speed. I'm checking. Only one, and it's faint. Aye Captain.  [Sickbay] It's one of the swarm. I'm working on it. Getting a general idea, something like, too late, should have listened. We've been hit with some sort kind of polaron burst. Captain, the burst has changed the shield polarity. It's now rotating at ninety two gigahertz. Captain, they're only forty thousand kilometres away. Still no weapons signature. Each one of those little ships is emitting an interferometric pulse. They're modulating in opposition to our shield frequencies, completely cancelling them out. The interferometric pulses they're emitting. They've reflected the energy of the phasers right back to us. I'm on it.  [Sickbay] Captain, I've got a pattern on the interferometric pulses. It's a lattice, connecting all the ships to each other. Shields are back to full strength.
It's a distortion in the space-time continuum, but it's got a graviton matrix. It's being artificially generated. Sensors can't get inside. The distortion field's fluctuating. Something's coming out. There's a subspace signature emanating from the ship. Captain, it's Federation! He's firing some kind of sub-atomic disruptor. Voyager's molecular structure is coming apart! It's working. The temporal rift is closed. According to astrometric readings the year is 1996. Yes, Ma'am! We've got an away team down there. How close to the surface would we have to get to beam them up? If we do that somebody's going to see us. (Tuvok's replacement gets a beep.) On screen. Absolutely not. [Santa Monica] (The away team follow the tramp as he puts up The End Is Coming signs on lampposts.) Anything so far? I can't imagine just watching the story and not being a part of it. Good work. Keep me informed, and don't get too swept away. What's our transporter status? That's exactly what the Captain ordered us not to do. We'd be risking detection. And if somebody sees a starship flying through the clouds? Helm, get a fix on Chakotay and the Captain. B'Elanna, stand by emergency transporters. Get ready to beam them directly to the bridge. Take us down. [Chronowerx - Starling's office] We've terminated the downlink, Captain, but he got at least twenty percent of our main computer files. I asked Neelix to monitor Earth broadcasts. I'm transferring it to the main viewer. (Amateur footage of something crossing the night sky very quickly.) Captain. I've analysed Braxton's schematic. The temporal technology is incredibly complex. The instant he jumps to the twenty ninth century, there won't be a twenty ninth century. Not for Earth anyway. The entire solar system will be destroyed. I'm isolating it, and suppressing the amplitude. Got him. Captain, there's a transport in progress. Starling's gone. He's beamed to the surface. He sent a transporter signal through our shields like they weren't there. Tracking the signal. He's back at the Chronowerx building. [Chronowerx - Starling's office] I think I can reroute fire command through the helm. Captain? Captain, with the activation sequencers down, you'd have to launch from inside the tube. It's too dangerous. The plasma exhaust will The Captain's in torpedo tube one. She's preparing for a manual launch. Commander, the field he's creating? It's unstable. On screen. He's entering the rift. Captain, the rift is opening. There's something coming out. It's the timeship. The timeship is re-entering the rift.
This is a real place? Yeah, it's nice. Loosen it up. Computer, add characters from Kim Sports Programme Theta Two. (Three fit young ladies in tight, shiny beachwear.) Volleyball. They're a Championship team. Gold medal winners in 2216. You know, this would be even better with more upbeat music. Great programme, Neelix. Not from here. We'd have to get within five thousand kilometres. I'm diverting warp power to the targeting scanners, trying to get a pattern lock. There's still too much interference. I've got a lock. Initiating transport. I've got them, Captain. All three passengers are in sickbay. I'm locked out. Commander, it's one of the shuttlecraft. Someone is beaming it into space. [Transporter Room one] It looks like the shuttle's plasma injectors were remodulated to suppress their warp signature. It takes some incredibly precise calibrations. Someone on that shuttle really knows what they're doing. [Shuttle] There's a residual trace of transporter activity. Looks like four people beamed from the shuttle to the surface. I can't. Some kind of interference has gone up around the whole structure. I've been scanning it for weaknesses. The system goes through a maintenance cycle every ten hours. There are a few seconds when it might be vulnerable to a narrow band EM pulse.
That's the edge of the shock wave. The pressure's over ninety kilopascals, thirty percent more than we predicted. But neither one was this close. Less than ten billion kilometres. Definitely a record. Sure beats working on the bridge. That'll be the day. (The ladies are removed to a newcomer.) Did it ever occur to you that she just doesn't like you? Make that two supernovas, Commander. I just picked up another one at two one seven mark four seven. Estimated time of implosion, sixty seven seconds. Commander, according to these readings, the shock waves have knocked us sixteen billion kilometres from our previous location. Er, Commander? She's put us on a direct course for another star about to go supernova. Captain, are you all right? Put down your weapons! No, ma'am. Nothing but calm space ahead. Looks like the war is over.
There's a lot of bioelectrical interference. I can't get a clear reading.
Sorry, Captain. Full spectrum scans. I'm on it. Er. That's kal-toh, isn't it? Vulcan chess? I should have known. Tuvok, I need your help. I want to eliminate emotions, like Vulcans do. I realise that. And I also know that Vulcans use certain techniques. I'm willing to learn. I have feelings I don't want to have. I'm in love, and I don't want to be. Her name is Marayna. She's not a member of the crew. She's a character on the holodeck. That's the problem. (Tuvok places his final rod, and the construct transforms into an elegant polygon.) I told you. I'm in love. I can't get her out of my mind. Not for a second. No. No. Yes! But we're talking about a holodeck character. Neelix. Have you seen Marayna? I completely forgot. The luau. Where's Marayna? She's part of this programme. How could you miss her? She's tall, athletic, blonde. Hi, Marayna. You were? She's a great instructor. It's like a knot. Yes. Er, yeah. Yes. What do you mean? That's not true. I guess it really did bother me. I was embarrassed, and I was sure Kes would take one look at my face and know exactly what I was feeling. Let's not even talk about that. [Turbolift] It's all so predictable. How does it end? I can't have a balanced, stable relationship with a holodeck character. Marayna's a computer programme. She could never feel for me what I feel for her. To tell you the truth, I don't even like hydrosailing. [Bridge] Captain, the temperature is nine thousand degrees kelvin. I'm picking up a subatomic cascade reaction. The plasma strand completely burned itself out. Sensors show some kind of dampening effect between the strands, but I can't isolate it. Come in. Hi, Tom. A Vulcan meditation. To suppress my emotions. Not really. Marayna. How did you know that? Am I that predictable? You sound like Tuvok. Logically, the best course is retreat. Meditation helps. I'm not hiding out. I'm deconstructing the emotional complex. No, wait. Computer, standard illumination. I'm getting tired of this anyway. What? I don't know. Maybe this isn't a good idea. Listen, I'm going back to my quarters. Tom! Yes, Captain. But it'll take a while. We'll have to simulate the process on the computer, and then try to recreate it with the deflector dish. Probably a few weeks. The warp drive seems okay. Impulse too. I think the problem must be somewhere else. I think maybe the helm's being blocked. Maybe. I'm sorry. I guess I've got a lot on my mind. What did Tom say to you? Hi. My name's Harry read-me-like-a-book Kim. Apparently it is. I can't get her off my mind. Thanks. I'll be in my quarters if you need me. [Turbolift]  Deck three. Computer, belay that order. Holodeck one. [Outside the holodeck]  Computer, activate Neelix resort programme. Enjoying yourselves? Now I know why you told me to keep off the holodeck. Stop analysing me! I respected you. I trusted you. And you did this right behind my back. Then what do you call this? I'll accept that from her, Tuvok, but not from you. You said to stay away from her. You should have done the same. If you say so, Lieutenant. I think it's a little late That's not going to help. I never should have come to you in the first place. I should have worked it out myself. [Bridge] Aye, Captain. We studied that case at the Academy. It gained control of the ship from inside the holodeck. This all started the day we got here. That's when I first met her. Maybe the nebula is somehow affecting the holodeck. Still holding, Captain, but the inertial dampeners are offline.  Transporting to the source of the uplink. [Holodeck – Paxau resort] I can't Captain. Something's blocking the signal. [Space station] Captain, ship's systems are coming back online. I thought kal-toh was beyond human understanding. Don't worry about it, Tuvok. Apology accepted. (Tuvok activates the kal-toh base.) Won't this take years to learn?
The forward array is ready to scan for temporal phase-shifting, chronoton particles or field flux. I would, sir. I know Captain Janeway wouldn't want us to be sitting around moping. She'd want us to be cheering each other up, remembering the good times. Like the away mission when we found all those bushes of over-ripe fruit. I must have eaten half a kilo. My hands and mouth were all purple, and the Captain. The Captain came and sat down next to me, and her mouth was all stained too. She put her arm around my shoulder and she said. She said, Ensign, these are the times we have to remember. It. It's. Sorry.
Aye, Captain. They're not responding. Still no response. He's right, they're adrift. I'm not picking up any active energy signatures. And no life signs. But what caused the shut-down in the first place? Or what? I'm only picking up one signal. It's in a heavily populated region. The signal's very weak. Electrodynamic turbulence from the nebula's interfering with transmission. It's going to take me a while to clear it up. [Settlement] (After the lovemaking, Chakotay is mending the communications array.) No response. Voyager, Emergency beam-out! [Bridge] Captain, the Borg ship has initiated a self-destruct sequence. It'll go in three seconds. Shields are holding. No injuries or hull damage. Audio transmission, Captain, from the planet surface.
Not sure. Sensors showed a simple nickel-iron composition. We shouldn't be seeing fragments more than a centimetre in diameter. Incoming hail from the surface. It's coming from one of the heavily damaged areas. I've lost the transmission. I can't find him. Too much interference. No response. Captain, I'm getting more detailed sensor readings on the approaching asteroid. It's huge, over half a kilometre in diameter, and it's moving faster than the others. Approximately two hours. [Mag-lev carriage] (Everyone except Tuvok is having obvious difficulty breathing.) There's a large crew compliment. At least two thousand. (Chakotay is at Tuvok's station.) Shields down to eighty five percent.
The operator's not responding. No response. And I can't get a fix on their positions. There's some kind of scattering field. Kim to bridge. We got them. And the Doctor seems to be back to normal. [Bridge]
Didn't we already pass a trinary system like this? It just seems familiar. Yeah, I guess so. They're hailing us. That ship's going to fire! Captain, we've got to defend ourselves. Raising shields and firing phasers. (Kim blasts a hole through the Narada's starboard wing.) Captain, I had to act quickly. Their weapons were charging. They were about to fire at us. We could have been destroyed. Then they must have fooled our sensors somehow. I detected a tetryon surge coming from their ship. No! It was their weapons. That whole welcome to Nasari territory was a trick. I can't explain that. I just knew. I was only trying to protect the ship. Is she going to be all right? B'Elanna almost got killed. It's my fault. I started that fight. I thought I was doing the right thing. For a moment I was absolutely sure. It's fading. What I did, and how I felt. It doesn't make any sense. And it could have been worse. What if they'd been more powerful than we were? I could have gotten everyone killed. You're right. Thanks. [Kim's dream] (Memories interspersed with a view of a planet from space.) Raising shields and firing phasers. I can't explain it. I just knew. I never wanted you to get hurt. I'm sorry. I try to be. Mom! (Kim wakes and goes to wash his face. He discovers interesting blotches around his hair and jaw lines.) [Sickbay] And the bad news? Last night I had a dream about being sick with the Mendakan pox when I was nine. Do you think this could be a recurrence? What? Is that serious? Doctor, you don't think there could be any psychological effects from this disease, do you? I've been having this strange deja-vu feeling. Then yesterday on the Bridge I had this sudden instinct, and I acted on it by firing without orders. We're still trying to figure that out. B'Elanna, I'm really sorry you got hurt. I know, but, er Never mind. I'm glad you're going to be all right. Take care of yourself. I was right. As soon as I saw their ship, I felt this sudden suspicion and loathing. I knew we were in trouble. How did I know? I really wish I could tell you, Captain, but for the past few days this area of space has seemed more and more familiar to me. If I didn't know it was impossible, I'd swear I've been here before. Oh, believe me, I have been. Space-time anomalies, alien telepathy, alternate realities. The list gets weirder as it goes on. Let me see a star chart of this region. Head for this system. I think we can make it. We'll be safe there, I'm sure of it. Taresia. Yes. It was in my dream. We'll be all right. (The new ship passes Voyager, firing at the Nasari.) They're already hailing us. Do you know me? What? Er, wait a minute. I still don't understand how this is possible. Our Doctor has found some genetic fragments in my DNA which could be part of an alien genetic structure. What I want to know is how I could have gotten them. My mother. What did you do to her? But you're saying I'm not. (The only other male there speaks. He has two adoring women hanging on his arms.) That's how Taresians say thank you, isn't it? But how could I know so much about a place I've never been? Yes, I can. These are words. Almost. I'd like to find out if I have any relatives here. Maybe talk to my biological parents. I'd like to stay for a while. I still have a lot of questions. Like me with Starfleet. All my life, that's all I ever wanted to do. Now I guess I know why. Strange to think that some alien DNA fragments have been controlling my life. Yes, I always wondered why I loved music so much when my parents, my human parents, were practically tone deaf. (The girls inject Taymon with a hypospray, then go to Kim.) Wait, wait a minute. What is that? I think I'll pass, thanks. First? And you're already planning on a second? It's called marriage, but it's usually one woman with one man. I wouldn't miss it. That's what my human parents used to say to me. How special I was. They'd been trying to have a baby for years until I came along. They called me their miracle child. They spoiled me rotten, making sacrifices so they could give me everything I wanted. But I never felt like I deserved that kind of devotion. I didn't see what was so special about me. I used to imagine that I had these hidden powers. I'd grow up to be stronger than a Klingon or able to read people's minds. Anything to make me more than just an average kid. Yeah, it does. That would be great. I already like it. I don't know about that. I'm happy where I am on Voyager. Thanks. I mean (strokes her cheek.) [Bridge] (Voyager is surrounded by the Nasari ships.) Why did they tie him like that? I guess I hadn't really thought of it that way. Actually, I should check in with Voyager. They'll be back by now. Kim to Voyager. This is Ensign Kim calling Voyager, do you read? It's been interesting. I was wondering if there's been any word from Voyager. It's been a long time. I hope they didn't run into trouble with the Nasari. Maybe so. No, I'll be fine, thanks. Goodnight. You're going to tuck me in? It's a human custom. Parents tuck their children into bed, tell them a story or sing a lullaby to them to help them get to sleep. (Eliann dims the lights and fetches a small pot from the dressing table.) Pleasant dreams. (She kisses him.) Mmm, that smells good. What are you doing here? Look, I appreciate the offer, but I'd really rather be alone. I can try. (He puts his boots back on.) I'm not joining with you or with anybody. No. Like I told you before, I'm going back to Voyager. My loyalty is to my crew and my family back home. Maybe this life wouldn't be so terrible. Three wives. I've got to think about my choice. You're right. I felt it too. I'm definitely considering you as one of my wives. (Kim sits Eliann on a chair, then takes Rinna's sash.) Well, it's like you said before. This could be exciting. Remember, you both want to make me happy, don't you? Sorry about that. [Outside Taymon's room] Are you in there? (He turns on the lights to discover a desiccated corpse on the bed, still with the blindfold on. He hears the door controls being operated, and grabs a metal instrument from the bedside table.) So this is what I should expect on my honeymoon? You mean easier for you to lead me to the slaughter. What'd you do to Taymon? That's why there are no men here. They don't leave with their embryos in stasis. They're killed. Was anything you told me true? About Taresians being born on other worlds? About my being one of you? Transformed. That's what these genes are doing to me. Don't count on it. You're going to take me to a communications terminal where I can contact my ship. (He takes her hostage. The other two wives enter.) Stay out of my way! I won't let you do this to me! Captain. They won't. He told his crew to cover their ears so they couldn't hear the Siren's song. But he also had them tie him to the mast of the ship so he could listen himself without being led astray as they sailed past. It wasn't just the women. There was also something exciting about having a new identity, and being more than just young Ensign Kim. Being likeable is fine, but sometimes I wish I could be more, oh, confident with women. More like you. That'll be the day. Thanks a lot. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Sweetheart, I understand how upsetting this is, but if it were you on that biobed, I'd feel just like Tom does. Your grandmother's very sick, son. Say cheese! (Kim takes the photograph that was by her bedside.) So how does it feel to be a grandfather? It's 56947. Why? To do that we'd need to know the precise temporal variance of the specific torpedo which contaminated the ship. Hull breach on deck seven. We're losing life support. That could work. If we remodulate the scanners to a parametric frequency we might be able to destroy the torpedo launchers before they fire. Including Captain Janeway and B'Elanna, we lost eleven people. Starboard shield generators and warp drive are offline, and power is down on decks four through twelve. Aye, sir. So, Kes, have you regained all your memories of the past? Don't worry, I haven't forgotten. Hey, give him a little credit. I bet he gets married and has a family. Don't mention it.
We should be getting close. That's funny, I'm not detecting it. Yes, and. Hold on. Now I'm getting something. It's debris. Boronite, sarium, carbon 60 composites. I'm not picking up any lifesigns, Captain. There don't appear to be any survivors. Maybe we can find out, Captain. There's a strange pattern that seems to be emanating from subspace. Looks like some kind of plasma particles. Wait a minute. Something. Can't tell, but it's getting more intense. (The ship starts shaking.) Something's coming out of subspace. (It is big, bright, and wormhole like.) Propulsion is offline, so is navigational control. It hit our starboard shields. No indication of casualties. It's highly charged with plasma. That explains the particle wake. Captain, we don't have any idea what caused that phenomenon, or what made it dissipate. So how do we investigate it if it's gone? We're starting to receive telemetry. Captain, this is one weird disturbance. I'm reading a temperature gradient of nine million Kelvin's, massive discharges of plasmatic energy, and there's a perfectly calm eye at the centre. It's disappeared. It's still transmitting, but there's a lot of interference. Captain, the eddy is starting to dissipate. Captain, subspace disruption. It looks that way. Transporters are offline. The shuttle's being drawn inside the eddy. Getting a lot of interference. Can't tell if it's a transmission or not. I've adjusted the encoding filter. Try it now. Not yet. Everything's too unstable. I'm trying. Hang on. Got it! The shuttle's aboard, Captain. One life sign.
Yes, ma'am. This is strange. I'm picking up spatial fluctuations. They're coming from the bridge. Not sure, but they're highly localised, with modulating phase variance. Looks like some kind of cloaking technology. Scanning on all subspace frequencies. I'm picking up two lifeforms. Mission Ops one. Captain, the lifeforms left the bridge. They're now on deck two, section thirteen. Mess hall. I'm reading a massive spatial displacement dead ahead. We're being probed. No response. They're locking onto the ship with an energy beam. It's cutting right through our shields. It's some sort of transporter. We've been beamed inside the alien vessel. I'm locked out of command control. All systems are shutting down. (Voyager goes dark and quiet.)
Internal sensors aren't showing anything unusual in the corridor where the Nyrian appeared, or Kes's last known location. I'll get it started. It may take a while. I er, wouldn't describe you that way, no. No, of course not. Very different. Way off. Looks like a surge of polaron particles. Captain. (One of the rocks is fuzzy. An alien steps through it.) Captain, there must be some kind of forcefield here, but I can't find it.
Still working on it, Captain. [Holographic Cargo Bay] Kim to Engineering. I think I can give you transporters now, Captain.
I've already configured the long range sensors to scan for transwarp signatures. An early warning system. In case we take on some uninvited guests? Captain, long range sensors are picking up transwarp signatures. Five point eight light years distant, closing from behind. I'm reading two Borg vessels. Make that three. Four. No, five. Fifteen Borg vessels. Distance two point one light years and closing. I'm picking up a polaron beam. We're being scanned. (A green vertical beam passes around the bridge.) No. Shields held. Warp engines are coming back online. All primary systems are stable. Yes, ma'am. Something strange is going on. They're dead in the water, about five point two light years from here. We're approaching the ships. A few, but they're erratic. But they did it. Fifteen Cubes! We might've just found our ticket through Borg space. An ally. Hold on. I'm picking up some sort of bio-readings. They're coming from the outer hull of one of the Borg ships. It's definitely organic, but our sensors can't penetrate its surface. I can't get a lock on it. Whatever that thing is, it's impervious to our technology. Looks like they're a little preoccupied. Commander. (Kim has found Kes' pile of Borg.) Didn't Kes say we were all going to die? Doesn't look like he's having much luck. It's a ship? Aye, sir.  There's someone in here with us and it's not the Borg. I can't localise it but it's within twenty metres. From where? (The alien appears. It is bipedal, but walks like a bird, leaning forward. It turns and slashes Kim with its claws. He screams as they are beamed out.) [Bridge] Thanks. Reporting for duty, sir. The Doctor gave me a clean bill of health. Did I miss anything? Transporters are offline! Shields and weapons are down. [Borg Chamber] I'm reading power fluctuations in the deflector array. It looks like the Borg have accessed deflector control. They're trying to realign the emitters. They've bypassed security protocols. (A green beam is emitted from the deflector dish.) I still don't have deflector control. Borg modifications are complete. Torpedo launch tubes active. Hull armour engaged. Shield enhancements stable. I've got a visual. Shields and weapons are offline! They're charging weapons! (Then one by one, the bioships go KaBOOM.) Captain, she's tapping into helm control. She's trying to access our coordinates. I can't.
Matter antimatter reaction at twenty two cochranes and rising. (Then it stops again.) Intake manifolds eleven and thirteen are still blocked. How could we forget? Amazing. How did you come up with the pattern duplication design?  I'll start here. You said the Borg got this stuff from species two five nine. Who are they? Guess the Borg meet a lot of people, don't they? Stupid question. So, what's it like out there in Galactic Cluster three? Try me. Ah. Interesting. (Seven's eyepiece zooms in on a communications node - Starfleet ID 59S47B.) The bulkhead in that section is coming apart. I've been trying. Her atomic structure is completely destabilising. [Shuttlecraft] We're coming apart!
