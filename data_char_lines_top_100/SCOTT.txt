Thank you, lad. We've got to get Franklin out of there. Aye, lad. Franklin. We went in together. Something's wrong. One of the inducers has failed. Boost the gain on the matter stream. Come on, Franklin. I know you're still in there. It's no use. His pattern's degraded fifty three percent. He's gone. So am I. He was a good lad. The Enterprise? I should have known. I bet Jim Kirk himself hauled the old girl out of mothballs to come looking for me. Captain Montgomery Scott. Tell me, how long have I been missing? Lieutenant? You've changed the resonator array. What have you done with the duotronic enhancers? Ah. Aye, that's right. We had an overload in one of the plasma transfer conduits. The Captain brought us out of warp and we hit some gravimetric interference and then there it was, as big as life. Is that a conduit interface? Aye, an actual Dyson Sphere. Can you imagine the engineering skills needed to even design such a structure? Well, we began a standard survey of the surface, and we were just completing the initial orbital scan when our aft power coils suddenly exploded. The ship got caught in the sphere's gravity well and down we went. Franklin and I were the only ones to survive the crash. Well, we didn't have enough supplies to wait for a rescue, so we had to think of something. I think it was only fifty percent brilliant. Franklin deserved better. From what I've seen, you've got a fine ship, Mister La Forge. A real beauty here. I must admit to being a bit overwhelmed. Thank you. Well, I'll say this about your Enterprise. The doctors are a fair sight prettier. Thank you, sir, and call me Scotty. I don't know. How am I feeling? I don't feel a day over a hundred and twenty. Well, I was never actually a member of the crew. I was just a passenger. I was heading for Norpin Five to settle down and enjoy my retirement. I'd be happy to. Sir. Engineering? I thought you'd never ask. (disappointed) Aye. [Scott's quarters] Good Lord, man, where have you put me? Bigger? In my day, even an Admiral wouldn't have had such quarters on a starship. You know, I remember a time we had to transport the Dohlman of Elaas. You never heard anyone whine and complain so much about quarters as she did. You know, these quarters remind me of a hotel room on Argelius. Oh, now there is a planet. Everything a man wants right at his fingertips. Of course, on the first visit, I got into a wee bit of trouble. Oh. Well then. Thank you. [Engineering] Oh, I don't think so, lassie, but I'll let you know if you can. We're in Engineering. Call me Scotty. I'm not here for a tour, laddie. I'm here to help. I was a Starfleet engineer for fifty two years, Mister La Forge. I think I'm still useful. Good. Let's get to work. [Bridge] Laddie, you need to phase-lock the warp fields within three percent or they'll become unstable. Well look here. The warp field is (the computer rejects his commands) Oh. Well, that would make the difference. I remember a time when the old Enterprise was spiralling in toward  Psi two thousand. The Captain wanted to try a cold start of the warp engines. I told him that without a proper phase lock it would take at least thirty minutes You canna change the laws of physics, I told him, but he wouldn't believe me, so I had to come up with a new engine start-up routine. Do you know that your dilithium crystals are going to fracture? Do you mind a little advice? Starfleet captains are like children. They want everything right now and they want it their way, but the secret is to give them only what they need, not what they want. How long will it really take? You didn't tell him how long it would really take, did you? Oh, laddie, you've got a lot to learn if you want people to think of you as a miracle worker. Now listen I was driving starships while your great-grandfather was still in diapers. I'd think you'd be a little grateful for a some help. I'll leave ye to work, Mister La Forge. [Ten Forward] Aye, lad. Scotch, neat. Thank you. (takes a drink) What in blazes is this? Laddie, I was drinking Scotch a hundred years before you were born and I can tell you that whatever this is, it is definitely not Scotch. Synthehol? You're not quite human, are you? Synthetic Scotch, synthetic commanders. What is it? Ah! [Corridor] (bottle and glass in hand, Scott walks carefully to the holodeck) The android at the bar said you could show me my old ship. Let me see it. The Enterprise. Show me the Bridge of the Enterprise, you chattering piece of NCC One Seven Oh One. No bloody A, B, C, or D. Here's to you, lads. Not at all, not at all. Have a drink with me, Captain. I don't know what it is, exactly, but I would be real careful. It's real (Picard knocks it back in one) Ah. Aye. You're familiar with them? I actually served on two. This was the first. She was also the first ship I ever served on as Chief Engineer. You know, I served aboard eleven ships. Freighters, cruisers, starships, but this is the only one I think of. The only one I miss. It's like the first time you fall in love. You don't ever love a woman quite like that again. Well, to the Enterprise and the Stargazer. Old girlfriends we'll never meet again. She's a beauty, with a good crew. But. When I was here, I could tell you the speed that we were traveling by the feel of the deckplates. But on your ship, I feel like I'm just in the way. I'm not eighteen. I can't start out like a raw cadet. No, there comes a time when a man finds that he can't fall in love again. He knows that it's time to stop. I don't belong on your ship. I belong on this one. This was my home. This is where I had a purpose. But it's not real. It's just a computer generated fantasy. And I'm just an old man who's trying to hide in it. Computer, shut this bloody thing off. It's time I acted my age. [Ready room] Never get drunk unless you're willing to pay for it the next day. I'll manage. The primary computer database should be online now. Give it a try. Bunch of old, useless, garbage. I say it's old, Mister La Forge. It can't handle the interface of your power converter. This equipment was designed for a different era. Now it's just a piece of junk. A century out of date. It's just obsolete. Maybe so, but when they can build ships like your Enterprise, who'd want to pilot an old bucket like this? We used to have something called a dynamic mode converter. You wouldn't have something like that on your Enterprise would you? Interference? They could've crashed into the sphere like the Jenolen. There's another possibility. They could be inside the sphere. Are ye daft? The main drive assembly's shot, the inducers are melted, and the power couplings are wrecked. We'd need a week just to get started. But we don't have a week, so there's no sense in crying about it. Come on, We'll see what we can do with your power converter. [Bridge] Shunt the deuterium from the main cryo-pump to the auxiliary tank. Where'd you get that idea? Regulation forty two slash fifteen, pressure variances on IRC tank storage? Forget it. I wrote it. A good engineer is always a wee bit conservative, at least on paper. Just bypass the secondary cut-off valve and boost the flow. It'll work. If we've done our jobs properly, the engines should be coming back online about now. Take the Bridge, Commander. I may be captain by rank, but I never wanted to be anything else but an engineer. The Enterprise ion trail leads right to this point. I'll bet you two bottles of Scotch that they're inside the sphere and that they went in right through that hatch. Look at the momentum distribution of the ions. It would take an impulse engine at full reverse to put out a signature like that. Aye. We found hundreds of them when we did our initial survey seventy five years ago. Aye. That was standard procedure at the time. We did it right before we crashed. Frequencies like our standard ship's hail. Very nice piece of reasoning, laddie. Nice indeed. Maybe all we need to do is to get our foot in the door. We might not be pulled inside when the hatch opens if we keep our distance from the sphere. Say, half million kilometres. Then when the hatch starts to close, we move in and we use the Jenolen to jam the hatch open, hoping that the Enterprise will escape. Geordi, the shields will hold. Don't worry about that. I can get a few extra gigawatts out of these babies. Geordi. I have spent my whole life trying to figure out crazy ways of doing things. I'm telling you, as one engineer to another, I can do this. Engines are ready. The plasma intercooler's gone. The engines are overheating. It's coming apart, Lad. I can't do anything else. [Bridge] There now, that wasn't so bad, was it? Captain's log, stardate 46125.3. Starfleet has dispatched two science vessels to study the Dyson Sphere while we proceed to Starbase fifty five. [Corridor] You're pulling an old man's leg. You soured the milk. Enjoy these times, Geordi. You're the chief engineer of a starship, and it's a time of your life that'll never come again. When it's gone, it's gone. Now, lad, I thought you were going to buy me a drink in Ten Forward. You're giving me one of your shuttles? Laddie, every woman has her own charm. You just have to know where to look for it. The Norpin Colony is for old men to retire. Maybe someday I'll end up there, but not yet. Thank you, sir, for everything. (each says their personal farewell and leaves) Bye, bye. (a kiss on the cheek) Thank you. A good crew. A fine ship. A credit to her name. But I've always found that a ship is only as good as the engineer who takes care of her, and from what I can see the Enterprise is in good hands.
