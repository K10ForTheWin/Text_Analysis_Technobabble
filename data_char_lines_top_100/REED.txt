You're breaking up, can't read.
Armoury.
Reed to Sickbay. Medical emergency. [Cavern]
Lieutenant Reed, sir.
Hello? (He sees a figure move, and talks into his communicator.) We're not alone, sir. There's someone in the forest. I believe he went in there. Yeah, he appeared to be a couple of metres tall, biped, odd-looking scales. It'd be best if I went first, sir. (He crawls through a small opening into another cavern. There's a noise behind them, and they see the tail of an armadillo-type creature disappearing through another hole.) Captain. I'm all right, sir. (He gets jumped by a man. Arche is on the other side of the opening.) Fancy meeting you here. I've lost a bit of blood, sir, but I don't think it's too serious. Don't worry about me, sir. I was just getting used to the place. That all depends. What's for dinner? (Athan puts another 'bowl' in front of Reed.) Looks a little undercooked. (eating a piece) Not bad. (Some young people are playing wind instruments made from digger skulls and other bones, a haunting gently melody.) [Ready room] Captain. Not badly, all things considered, but I really wouldn't mind getting this bullet out of my leg.
Andorians, yes. [Bridge] Well, what do they want?
No, sir. Yes, Captain.
Understood.
For example, what kind of weapons they carry. Why is that? I'm reading hull damage. Their warp reactor's offline and most of their primary systems are down. Some of it doesn't appear to be from the Fortunate. The main hatch is damaged. No chance we'll get a positive seal. If you didn't need our help, why did you send out a distress call? Get down. What was that? (The module gently floats away from the freighter.) [Bridge] (The viewscreen is showing it happening.) It's difficult to be sure at this distance, sir. Looks like some kind of plasma discharge. I can't rule out our boomer friends. Fore and aft plasma cannons. I doubt those shields of theirs would hold up to our torpedoes. One of the Nausicaan ships has locked weapons on us, sir. The Nausicaan ships are firing, sir.
Understood.
Yes, Captain. Aye, sir.
It's pretty crowded out there. A lot of spacecraft and artificial satellites.
Almost certainly? Is this how you protect your visitors? From what we can tell, the entire capital is surrounded by a shanty town. There are almost as many biosigns on the outskirts as there are inside the city. Not yet. They must have switched it off. Sir, I've got a rescue team standing by in the launch bay. It's our shuttlepod. I'm certain of it. All I'm suggesting is we go down and have a look around. They called the Captain 'her'. Are we sure they've got the right hostages? For how long? We don't have forty phase pistols, we've got fifteen, and even if we give them to these people there's no guarantee they'll keep their word. We know where the shuttle is. We have to send a team down now while we still have the element of surprise. Sounds to me like you're planning an assault. This isn't your planet. Maybe the Coridan government has something to say about this. Yeah. (They get jumped and dragged off with bags over their heads.) [Another room] (The bags are removed.) So, you and the rebels figure you both have a common enemy. How many? Unless he's going to take out these guards, you're not going to have an easy time getting all the way to the hostages. (Shran gets weapons from a box.) Our escape plan's shot to hell. Yes, sir.
You heard the Sub-Commander. Load two this time. [Shuttlepod]
A ship?
Sir, there's a ship approaching at half impulse. They're hailing us. Hoshi says they're using a Vulcan frequency. [Bridge] (A small ship with curved nacelles is on the viewscreen.)
Sir, I'm picking up a small planet on our current heading. It's not a system, Captain. It's just a planet. I'm picking up a power signature near the equator. There's a ship down there. Well, the proof's in the pudding, Captain. Follow me. You were a Boy Scout, sir? Oh, so was I. Twenty eight. You? Oh, that's not bad, sir. Actually, I already have that one. [Campsite] (Complete with tents and a fire.) Did you hear that? Anything? It's not gone. (They are jumped by two people wearing red goggles and camouflage-style overalls.) Captain, are you all right? Pleased to meet you. Your friends nearly shot me back there. Mmm. No argument here. I'm curious why our sensors didn't detect you. That gear you carry seems pretty elaborate to take down a few game animals. I wonder if I might join one of your hunts. You were able to sneak up on us without being detected by our night-vision sensors. I'd like to see how you did that. I promise I won't kill anything, sir. Like those bore worms. I wouldn't miss it. Night. I suppose I'll turn in then. A nightgown, sir? These can detect infrared. (Damrus takes them off him.) I'll try to keep up. What is it? Is there something out there? Well, let's find out. I didn't see it. We split off to follow another trail. So, how'd you lose them? They're well armed and they know the terrain. I wouldn't want to try and take their weapons from them.
I've located the ship, sir. Aye, sir. This is where they say their engines were hit. Impact damage, sir. No scorch marks, no melting. No indications of any weapons fire. It's possible. They also say they haven't sent out a distress call because it'd give away their position. They crashed three years ago, sir. Whoever attacked them has to be gone by now. Why are they still hiding? There's also their airponics bay. How are they surviving down there? It doesn't make any sense. Hoshi translated the data module we found on their ship, and we were able to reconstruct what happened right before they crashed. There are some gaps in the data, but it looks like some kind of catastrophic malfunction. There was a massive depressurization when the ship went down. When their story didn't check out the Captain asked me to run some detailed scans of the ship. According to the oxidation rate in the hull plating that ship's been sitting down there a lot longer than three years. Check the scans yourself. The data also shows that they launched a number of escape pods just before the crash. I think it would be better if we stay together, sir. Unfortunately, that rules out using the transporter as well. (The security team board the pod.) And with a bit of luck, near T'Pol and Commander Tucker. [Alien computer core] Yeah. Where did he come from?
Congratulations, Ensign. Your case is about to be dismissed. (A little later - it's that map again.)
Doctor?
Captain, can you come to the Bridge?
I can't localise their biosigns. I'll take a shuttlepod and find them myself. I've lost sensor contact with the surface. Some kind of orbital dispersion field. I can't get any readings below a hundred kilometres. [Desert] (A perfect blue sky, pale pink sand dunes stretching for ever with Archer and Trip following a sharp wind-cut ridge.) There were eighty nine. There were only eighty nine Suliban, not thousands. I would hardly call it an army. It was more like a few dozen prison guards, and to be honest they didn't put up much of a fight. Actually, I'm the tactical officer on this ship, and I don't have any experience at waging desert warfare. I'm afraid you've come to the wrong people for help. How did you get here without them seeing you? I'll need all the pertinent data. I'm a quick study. Then they'll have to wait a little longer. You're the one that got our people stranded down there. (doing the flying) If we increased our altitude this would go a lot faster.
(getting drunk) That place up the street looked pretty lively.
She's all yours, Captain. Good luck.  (Archer hands phase pistols to T'Pol and Tucker.) Go ahead. Bridge to Archer. We're getting some strange readings, sir. It might not be a bad idea for you to come out here. [Bridge]
Hello? Please repeat. I can't understand. I still can't understand you. Try modulating the sub-carrier wave.
I'm removing the panel. [Hull] Go ahead. The closest thing I'm familiar with that this device resembles is a Triton-Class spatial torpedo. I've disarmed at least half a dozen of those. I believe I can do it, sir. [Bridge] Another one of those spikes I told you about.
It can't be ethical to cause a patient this much pain. When will I be able to return to duty? Two weeks? You're not putting any more of those things inside my leg. You still haven't found the last one. Are you sure this thing knows what it's doing? You didn't answer me the first two times. Lovely. None. [Ready room] Honestly, I started to feel a little sorry for the Doctor. There wasn't anything for him to do but stand there and watch this thing work. A starship without a Tactical Officer? I can't say I see the point. I suppose you're right. I don't follow. Well, that compartment's the only place it could be, but it's barely half the size of this one. You could always ask. Well, I guess that's that. This computer might not take kindly to people snooping around. I left it in a Romulan minefield.(He sighs and gestures for another look at the PADD.) [Station corridor] (Tucker is sitting on Reed's shoulders to remove a If the Captain learns about this we'll both be scrubbing plasma conduits for a month. (They climb up into the ventilation shaft.) [Travis's quarters] (The comm. beeps.) Are you sure this is the right direction? (An alarm goes off, an iris closes off the shaft in front of them, then they get beamed away to...) [Bridge] Aye, sir. It might be a good idea to check his quarters as well. Aye, sir. [Station diagnostic room] No. It doesn't look like Travis used the comm. system last night. Crewman Hayes says she passed him on his way to the launch bay but they didn't speak. She said he seemed to be in quite a hurry. (There is text on a monitor.) It's a letter to his sister. It was on the monitor when I came in. I'm afraid there isn't much here. He mentions something about cancelling breakfast with him. Sub-Commander T'Pol's working on it, but it could take some time. Cargo ships aren't always easy to track down. (comm. beeps) We were within twenty metres when we tripped the sensors. I believe so. There's no effect. They're going offline. We're losing main power. It did some heavy damage, sir. Power levels are dropping, but the plasma hasn't ignited the O2 conduits yet. Yes, sir. (A pause, then the ship starts to shake.) I'm reading secondary explosions throughout the station. (The station starts to fall apart, and Enterprise's light come back to full brightness.) One of those arms is still locked onto the hull. At this range, sir, I wouldn't recommend it.
Go ahead, Captain. The Klingon ship's gone to warp, sir. I'm sending a shuttlepod down.
I could use a few days to recalibrate the torpedo launchers. Water polo? Are you sure the Captain wouldn't have a problem with you using his dining room? While we're on the subject of approvals, I promised Captain Archer that I'd recalibrate the torpedo launchers. I'll need to divert computer access from Main Engineering. It'll only be for a day. We're not exactly going anywhere. Is that the Chief Engineer talking, or the Acting Captain?
With your permission, Captain, I'd like to write the report to Starfleet. It was my first visit to a pre-warp culture. Seems only fitting.
This is a Tactical Alert. All hands report to your stations. I repeat, this is a Tactical Alert. [Bridge]
I read you, Commander. You can do it, Ensign. It's as easy as one, two, (A crewman steps into the turbolift and activates it.) [Sickbay] The stream's too unstable. You can do it, Ensign. It's as easy as one, two The stream's too unstable. You can do it, Ensign. (she jumps onto the alien transporter pad) It's as easy as one, two (she dematerialises) [Transporter alcove]
Lieutenant Reed. The Captain asked me to escort you back to your ship. I'm afraid I'm under orders. It's just a precaution. He's trying to break loose. Direct hit to the port nacelle. He's dropping out of warp. So did I. That cloud he released, it got into the plasma vents. They'll have to be purged. The prisoner, sir, as ordered. Will there be anything else, Captain?
If we reinforce structural integrity we should be able to weather it without too much trouble. Actually, there is something. (Reed climbs down into Phlox's area.) I assume I can depend on doctor-patient confidentiality. Is it that obvious? The EV simulator at Lunaport, or as Starfleet trainees call it, The Vomitorium. Thank you, Doctor. Never better. (Reed leaves.) I'll see your strawberry shortcake, and I'll raise you one pineapple cobbler. (Hoshi puts down her bet.) Oh, what I wouldn't give for a shower right about now. When this hand's over maybe you could look into building one. You knew we'd be stuck in here for over a week. You might've given it a little thought to making it tolerable. Well, I obviously overestimated your people's abilities when it comes to indoor plumbing. Pot roast? Oh, come on. That's the third time in three days. We're having movie night in here? They're trying to re-initialise the warp reactor, sir. It seems to me they've already decided to help themselves to Enterprise. I could take a security team and bring back more. Aye, Captain. (Archer heads off on his own to the Galley, and gets at a control panel there.) [Catwalk command area] Go ahead. [Catwalk command area] It's hard to tell them apart in those ridiculous hats.
I detected weapons fire and then both ships just disappeared. Approximately fifty thousand kilometres, bearing zero zero three mark two seven, I think. I can't be more specific. It's the damned interference.
I don't know about you, but I find her quite attractive. (Tucker gets on the other bicycle.) You haven't done anything to make her think that you Tell him what? That his wife is trying to seduce you? Not a good idea. It might be a lot easier to avoid her advances than to get Phlox angry. I once saw him lose his temper when one of his creatures bit him. It wasn't a pretty sight. [Sickbay]
And our officers? I think the Vulcans see them, too. They're breaking orbit. Probably giving themselves room to manoeuvre. The Vulcans are charging weapons. The Andorians as well. If you don't mind me asking, what do you have in mind? [Colony] (Archer is making his way underneath the position of the second sniper to sneak up behind her. It's Talah.) Locked and ready.
I'm not reading any weapons signatures. Possibly some sort of accident. If it is, it's been fused shut. With your permission, sir? (He gets a phase pistol and starts cutting into the thing. When he's done, Archer forced the hatch open and starts coughing. T'Pol checks that the air inside is safe. Archer climbs inside and finds a seat at the far end. He turns it around to discover a desiccated occupant.) Maybe he got a ride from someone. Could be an escape pod. Commander. (They've uncovered a round thing with thick wires leading off it in 4 directions.) Registers as some kind of bio-matter. Maybe we should get Phlox to come down and take a look. I see it. (it is a ladder heading off down into somewhere that shouldn't be there, given that the pod is no taller than a person.) It could be a hologram. You're not going down there? We should call the Bridge first. Let them know This gives space exploration a whole new meaning. You're the engineer. I'm picking up an energy signature. It's very faint. [Bridge] Commander! (A Suliban gets into the bay control room.) [Bridge] I'm getting unusual thermal readings. It's awfully warm inside that ship, more than two hundred degrees. That beam's interfering with our targeting scanners. Assuming that is the power grid. It boggles the mind, if you think about it. That ship could be from the thirty first century. When I was young, I always wanted to build a time machine, see the future. Don't tell me you've never wondered what it would be like. How our mission will turn out. If Daniels came here and offered you a chance to go to the thirty first century, you wouldn't take it? And you call yourself an explorer. Absolutely. Think of all the awkward first dates I could avoid. Sounds perfect. If we're happily ever after, what difference does it make? They're similar to the ones in the cockpit. He'd probably make a quick meal of you. If I could travel back in time, I know exactly what year I'd pick. 1588. England defeated the Spanish Armada. He'd probably make a quick meal of you. It seems like we were just in here. If I could travel back, I know exactly what year I'd pick. I think we're spending far too much time together. (They haul a plate off the Tardis exterior - again) I always wanted to meet a stegosaurus. The stegosaurus was a herbivore. [Bridge] We didn't imagine what happened. [Situation room] (T'Pol is studying the large display table.) We've spent a fair amount of time around that ship. They're charging weapons. We're losing ventral plating. Direct hit to the launch bay doors. They're trying to blast them open. They're offline, too. The hull plating's depolarising. I never thought I'd be glad to see the Suliban. Four minutes. Less if I had some help. I recommend moving the warhead as little as possible once we remove it. It was only an estimate, sir. I'm going to release the couplings. You'll need to disconnect the power conduits. The blue and red ones first. Turn the release counterclockwise until you feel it detach. [Engineering] Sir, if you'll hold it by the locking brace. (They remove the warhead. Archer helps to undo the casing.) It was only an estimate, sir. It's happening again. We've had this conversation before. I'm not certain. If time's not repeating outside the launch bay, the Tholians could be close. Aye, Captain. (Archer places the warhead inside the Tardis.) It was only an estimate, sir. At least twice, maybe more. I'd recommend putting more distance between us and that ship. Good question.
They took some weapons fire. Main power's offline. Gravity plating, life support. None. [Situation room](A little later, in the situation room at the back of the Bridge.) Pan zan? Too badly damaged to be much help. If they were, they didn't go without a fight. Are your patrols in the habit of arresting innocent people? You certainly made one this time. And we're determined to get our people back. A good place to get lost in the crowd. Two. It's them. I recommend we use the transporter once we're in range. I don't think so. Four biosigns. They're all Enolian. (The Enolian looks at the image on the viewscreen.) Fore and aft particle cannons. Nothing we can't handle.  [Prison transport Bridge] Loud and clear, sir. (Tucker holds up his shackles.) Captain, Travis says he can't maintain the docking seal much longer. It's now or never, sir! (Kuroda shuts himself in the Bridge. Reed drags Archer onto the shuttle which then disengages and escapes back to Enterprise. Then Kuroda discovers that Archer was telling the truth, and braces himself for a fiery death.)  [Enterprise docking port and corridor]  
Captain, look at this. (He holds out a scanner.)
Captain, please report to the Bridge. [Bridge] (A Klingon ship is on the viewscreen.)
You must be joking. Yes. Well, they'd better post a psychologist onboard because I'd need one if my parents were roaming the corridors. Thermal shear. Some of those eruptions are getting close to Enterprise.
Then why don't the Denobulans evacuate their own scientists? Five hundred metres. (with scanner) Nothing but three humans, one of which is not entirely convinced we're going in the right direction. There's an opening. Over here. (further on they come to a sheer drop) Still willing to bet they came this way? Travis! Hey, what's that? (Tucker dusts off a metal box.) You don't suppose Denobulans carry out everything they bring in? Looks like we're on the right track. (They prepare to follow Travis.) [Sickbay] They went that way. Well, look at those. (He shines his light on some pretty crystals.) If I was a geologist, that's the way I'd go. I don't have much choice. It's getting steeper. We're already behind schedule, Ensign. We can't have you slowing us down. Thanks for getting us this far. More of the same. I didn't see any other passage. Three biosigns. Denobulan. About fifty metres. (They come out into a proper big cavern with artificial lights set up and scientific equipment.) The Denobulan Science Academy asked us to find you. Not quite. Your Science Academy will hold us responsible if we come back alone. You can't stay here forever. (further back) What's the problem? Feels like weapons fire to me. Pretty high yield by the sound of it. You mean to tell us that you climbed down that rock face without any ropes, any safety equipment at all? I'm fine. We need to get out of here before it starts up again. [Sickbay] Minimal damage. They're using low-power particle beams. [Bridge]
How long before it goes supernova? We may not be able to get any closer, but someone else has. Bearing two six one mark four. They must be at least twenty thousand kilometres farther in than we are. Aren't you going to introduce me? Very pleased to meet you. Indeed. I was just speaking with their Chief Engineer and his wife. Maybe you should say hello. (Tucker hands his sundae over to Reed.) Actually there are hundreds, maybe thousands. They have the strongest smells of anything we have on board. You said our food was aromatically bland. I thought this might change your mind. Try some. How about this one? (He offers a blue-veined cheese.) Stilton. Chef says it's pretty pungent. Not for a long time. I'd say that's more than a little spicy. (He eats it.) Alsatian Muenster. Very. There's an old Earth expression. I'll show you mine if you show me yours. [Stratopod] Photonic? I'm not familiar with that. This technology must seem pretty antiquated to you. Is that how you see us? Quaint? Sarium micro-cells. I suppose that's very quaint, too. Maybe you'd like to see the phase-cannon assembly. After you.(He enjoys the sight of a tightly-trousered rear end.) It has multiphasic emitters and a maximum yield of eighty gigajoules. I'm sorry it's so cramped in here. Really? On Earth, it's customary to ask a woman to dinner first before spending the night with her.
That should do it. We'll reach that transport in less than an hour. Let's modify as many of these as we can. [Bridge] (The Arctic transport is a lot more angular now, with a green glow at the stern.)
Follow me,  Sub-Commander. (She rushes at him and gets stunned.) [Skalaar's  ship] (Docked 
Captain, we've got Suliban ships. Eight of them, approaching at high warp.
Is there going to be some kind of service?
No, sir. [Locker room] (Archer, Reed and some MACO's are getting into EV suits.) And don't forget, just because sensors didn't pick up any biosigns doesn't mean you won't encounter anyone. Weapons fire. (Kemper opens a door and seeing a corpse.) They're charging weapons. I'm sorry, sir. Yeah. (checking internal sensors) Two in Cargo Bay one, four more in Engineering. Woods, you're with me. [Bridge] Black tea, hot. You finished rewriting the physics books? A few hours rest might do you a world of good. You still can't sleep? I wasn't thinking anything. The Captain and I managed to bring the guidance systems online, but we're going to need more time for the aft launchers. Fuller knew those torpedo systems better than anyone. He won't be easy to replace. Considering all the hostile aliens we've met, I suppose it's fortunate we haven't lost more people. There's no reason to get cynical. What do you suggest we do, turn around and go back to Earth? Captain, the particle decay rates don't match. This one is at least nine hours old, this one was left less than an hour ago. Power's fluctuating. Forward plating's down. Who could build something that big? That cloaking field is enormous. Whoever built this thing went to a great deal of trouble to conceal it. We've cycled through the standard frequencies. On the lower right side. What's that down there? Let's hope there's no one home. We're all clear, sir. They're not going to run out of stem-bolts any time soon. This way. Starfleet ration packs. (Archer takes out his anger on the stacked contraband until his communicator chirps.) Check behind those canisters. (Meanwhile, Hoshi is in the Situation room, working on translating the manifest.) Captain? The airlock's decompressing, sir. He'll die. Sir. Captain! (Orgoth drops to his knees, Archer opens the door and lets him crawl out.) Let's go. (Reed and the guard haul Orgoth away.) [Situation room] Hull plating's holding. Not without risking damage to their main computer. Their engines are down.
Captain, I'm picking up a metallic signature at the northern end of those equatorial islands. It looks like a landing craft. What about him? (sweating) I never much care for the tropics. (alien) We don't have time for this. We have to find Urquat. It's all that matters now. We have to keep looking. It's somewhere close. They can help us, tell us what happened, why we can't remember. Have you got anything for my stomach? The Chef's food isn't sitting too well. What do you suggest I eat? Not bad, sir. How about yourself? Thank you, Captain. I could use a little rest. (Reed leaves.)
Bridge to Captain Archer. Two vessels are approaching from aft. Sir, [Bridge] Bridge to the Captain. The smaller ship is approaching the starboard docking port.
Go ahead sir.
Go ahead. (the figure is gone) Hoshi? Is everything all right? Hoshi? [Command Centre]
There are no defensive systems? It's also possible that what we've been told about this colony isn't accurate. We're putting a lot of faith in Hoshi's telepathic friend. (Archer brings up sensor readings of the planet.) If anyone sees us, they'll think we're a meteor.  [Forest] Eight hundred metres, just over that rise. (A little farther on.) REED: That's definitely the source of the energy readings.(Archer looks through his binoculars.) I'm not picking up any security devices. Approximately eighty inside the complex, but not within a hundred metres. (Archer uses his phaser to cut through the metal grill.)  [Refinery Storage room] (One window looks out over a massive industrial area. Reed scans some canisters.) Captain. Some kind of radiolytic compound. It doesn't match anything in our database. There's several hundred kilograms n this room. (A door opens, and the three hide.) Captain, this place obviously has something to do with the weapon. It seems to me the sooner we put it out of commission, the better. There's nobody else here, sir. Apparently he lives alone. Congratulations, sir. Three months ago we entered the Expanse with no idea who these Xindi were or how to find them, and now we're about to destroy one of their weapons facilities. They struck first. Let's not forget the seven million people who were killed. What about Gralik, sir? He'll tell them about Enterprise. The reptilians seem rather upset about something.  [Sickbay] (The weapon is in the Imaging Chamber.) Captain. They've gone. Just because you didn't show up for work? Someone's closing on our position, sir. Four hundred metres. I'm not certain. Three hundred and fifty metres. Still closing, sir. Two hundred metres, one fifty. They're bloody fast, whoever they are. (Archer runs through the trees.) No, sir. We just might have stopped those bloodhounds before they transmitted our position. Permission to speak freely? I'm not sure it was wise to let him go. There are two of them, loading containers. They're heading back. We've run into a small problem. Stand by.  [Outside refinery entrance]
 We’re losing forward hull plating! (T'Pol is in Starfleet uniform.) No effect. Weapons are offline.  There’s a power surge in the starboard nacelle. It seems to have been caused by an anomaly. After course. Twenty degrees to port. [Corridor] (An anomaly rips alone the corridor. They run to a junction but bulkheads blow out and T'Pol's foot is trapped by debris. Archer tries to free her.) That last one took out warp engines. We’ve lost weapons. It is. (T'Pol steers Enterprise so that the docked ship smashes into the other Xindi vessel and breaks up. The starboard nacelle is damaged too.) Both ships are disabled. [Situation room] We’ve taken nine prisoners but the Brig was only designed for two. I’m not sure what to do with the others. We’re not going to get very far at that speed.  There’s a ship approaching at high warp. It’s Vulcan. You're looking well, sir. Actually, I’ve been promoted to Captain.  I’m picking up an intermittent duranium signature. I’m not certain. It’s in a close orbit around the sun.  There’s a small vessel just outside the chromosphere. The hull configuration doesn’t match. There’s one biosign on board. His warp coils are charging. We searched your ship. We didn’t find any cargo. We found your species in our Vulcan database. It appears Yridians are information dealers. Phlox? The Xindi ships are in range. Our shields are holding. Nice to know they work in combat. The Insectoid ship's been damaged. They’re losing power. Their engine's disabled. Forward shielding’s at fifty two percent. [Corridor] Our phase cannons are down. Our forward shield's collapsing! They’re targeting the Bridge!
We've scanned ninety percent of the surface. [Command centre] But they're all constructed of materials indigenous to the planet.
Two thousand five hundred kilodynes. [Shuttlepod One]
Go ahead. Aye sir.
Bridge to Captain Archer. We've picked up a vessel approaching at impulse. They're transmitting a distress signal. [Bridge]
We just grazed it. No damage. We're losing hull integrity. Atmosphere's venting on D deck. Main power's going down. They haven't even got enough power to light a camp fire. I couldn't even guess without a chance to sort this out. We'd be giving them access to critical systems, sir. Aye, sir. [Corridor] Yeah, no crumpets either, thank you. I need all the caffeine I can get. What's the situation in Engineering? Worse. I'm Lieutenant Reed. It's coffee, and just for the record, I haven't left the Armoury for so much as a bathroom break in nearly twelve hours. And you are? This is Commander Tucker, our Chief Engineer. Indeed. Well, I'll see if I can find something for you to do. The spanner will do the job nicely. If you wouldn't mind. That'd be lovely. Give my regards to Commander Shran. I beg your pardon? I'm sorry I wasted your time on our primitive systems. Lieutenant Talas. I apologise if I've been rude. Why don't I get us both a cup of coffee and we can align these relays together. Captain's starlog, December 6th, 2153. With some assistance from the Andorians we've managed to steer clear of anomalies. [Bridge] All we have left is to reset the emitters. I'll do it. No offence, but when it comes to our weapons frequencies I wouldn't trust my own mother. It's just an expression. Really. You come from a military family. Three, on my father's side. What? Actually, we haven't done much exploring for quite a while, but since you ask, he wasn't very pleased. The Royal Navy was his life. I'm sure he would. Right, all done. I'll power it up and we'll see where we stand. (when his back is turned, Talas points a blue light at the couplers) [Bridge] Torpedoes are back online, and thanks to Lieutenant Talas we should have phase cannons within the hour. I've never gotten them above ninety three. If you ever decide to leave the Imperial Guard, Starfleet could certainly use you. You're just being thorough. So, anything we need to worry about? Even with our primitive weapons? Hull plating's holding. They're breaking off. Back online. You were right, sir. If I hadn't been watching that Andorian officer it might have taken weeks to find where she'd sabotaged the array. They've reduced speed. We'll intercept them in fourteen minutes. [Shran's Ready room] No damage sir. They were much closer than we were. Their hull's intact but there's significant damage to their engines and power systems.
Bridge to Command centre. The radiation could overload our systems again. Acknowledged. [Shuttle] Understood. (Degra sees something out of the porthole.) Bridge to the Command centre. We're clear of the debris field. The Xindi vessel's less than an hour away, sir. Captain's starlog, supplemental. Hopefully the journey to Azati Prime will be the final leg in our search for the Xindi weapon. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

I've seen men like Hayes all my life.
Another detour. That's still less time than it would take to go around it.
I think it's safe to assume it's dead.
Bridge to T'Pol. There's no need to go to the Xindi. It appears they're coming to us. [Bridge]
Go ahead. Aye sir. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are for educational and entertainment purposes only.
Commander, I have a problem.  [Ship's hull] Tactical alert. All hands to stations.  [Bridge]
I suggest we enter here, above this layer of metreon gas. It should reflect our engine signature, create multiple sensor ghosts, false readings. If we're lucky they won't know which one to fire at. [Degra's ship] (He's docked with another Xindi ship,) Are you sure it's not a sensor reflection? Must be the NX02, Colombia. Phase cannons are offline. All plating's gone. No sign of pursuit. Is this taken? No. Actually, I didn't. Apparently the Reed family line came to a rather unceremonious end. You'd think on a ship quite this size I'd have been able to find someone, but. Yeah, and it would appear I'm going to be one of them. This seat's available.  [Ready room] They're preparing to go to warp. They have the same complement of weapons as we do. Weapons are gone. Sir, they still have one torpedo in the forward tube. It's locked onto our starboard engine. Weapons are standing by. They've detected us. Three ships are on an intercept course. (weapons fire hits Enterprise) The nebula's interfering with our targeting scanners. We'll have to wait until they get closer. Aft plating's at forty two percent. Just a few more seconds, sir. We have a lock. The lead ship's been disabled. The other two are falling back. Sir, the Kovaalans will be in weapons range in less than twenty seconds. [E2 - Bridge] Weapons are down. [E2 - Bridge] No sign of pursuit. No sign of him yet, sir. Captain's starlog, supplemental. It's been five hours, and the other Enterprise still hasn't arrived. Repairs to our impulse drive are underway. [Ready room]
Can you pin-point it?
Captain Archer, please report to the Bridge. [Bridge] Bridge to the Captain. We're approaching the co-ordinates.
The Captain wants to take a team aboard to destroy it. I need three volunteers.
We've got less than ten hours before this weapon reaches Earth. The captain wants to take a team aboard to destroy it.
I think I've pinpointed where the timeline changed. Someone assassinated Lenin in 1916. No one. So without Lenin, the Bolsheviks never gained power. Russia didn't become Communist, and Germany never considered it a threat. After France, Belgium and the Netherlands fell. Hitler quickly took England and then the eastern United States. The police never captured Lenin's assassin. Some bystanders claimed that the killer vanished into thin air. But I thought we were here to prevent Vosk from starting the temporal war. Engines took a serious hit. Weapons are down. There's heavy bombing. Most of it in eastern Pennsylvania and southern Virginia. It could be an Allied attack. The closest fighting is a hundred kilometres south of New York City. Incredible. Engines are at thirty six percent. Manoeuvring thrusters are offline. The targeting array's fried. We'll be shooting in the dark. [Street] He did it. One hundred kilometres. Targeting scanner still can't get a lock. I'm going to have to do this the old-fashioned way. Switching to visual scanners. German dive-bombers. Stukas. Nothing too much to worry about. However, they were fitted with sirens to frighten the enemy during an attack. They fire seven point nine millimetre rounds. We're too far away. I still can't see it. (Enterprise is being strafed by the aircraft, and they are making an impact on what is left of the hull.) One more kilometre. (The ship sweeps down over the skyscrapers, shooting down aircraft as it goes.) [Nazi Weapons Facility] (Vosk steps up in front of the conduit.) I can see it.
Not exactly travelling light, are you? Okay. I trust you'll be taking the proper precautions on the surface. I'm surprised you haven't heard. An Andorian and two Rigelians were attacked. Apparently the Xindi incident has caused a degree of xenophobia. It's hard to believe in this day and age. I'm told the Vulcans are staying behind the walls of their compound. I don't think this is the same planet you remember, Doctor. People are looking for someone to blame and they don't care who it is. Well, thank you, that's very kind of you to say. Unfortunately, we can't actually give tours of the ship. If that policy ever changes, you two will be the first to know. Do you think I wore this jacket to attract attention? (It does have the Enterprise patch on the sleeve.) Is there something we can help you with? We're not going anywhere, Doctor. Sir, Why don't you just go back to the bar? Doctor? [T'Pol's family home - living room] (We see that the kitchen is part of the main area, as T'Les comes in. Trip is fixing her stasis unit.)
Reed. Yes, sir.
Imagine having Soong as your teacher. We'll check out the rest of this place. (Archer finds video files of Soong with the children at a birthday party) Hold it! (The lad runs into the main room.) Captain! Captain. We're nearly out of transporter range. If that's what it takes to stun them, what have you got to do to kill them? [Station Control Hub] (Malik hauls the Station's Deputy Director into the tube.) We're not talking about normal human beings here. Somewhere else?
The panel to the left.
Captain! Still in one piece. It's probably an emergency light running on batteries. Well, there's something here. Some kind of surveillance recorder. (Travis lifts a piece of debris to reveal a device.) The timer might be broken, but that bomb's armed. Don't move. The slightest vibration might set it off. Reed to Enterprise. I need an emergency transporter lock. Two to beam up on my mark. If there's a gravity switch, it'll detonate in the matter stream. Negative, Enterprise. Stand by. (He puts the open communicator on his shoulder, like a phone.) I'm going to attempt to scan it. Yeah. If I had designed that bomb, I'd rig it to go off the instant a sensor beam made contact. Look on the bright side. If it detonates, we'll never know. Steady. There's Vulcan DNA on these controls. So much for blaming Andorians. Boosting scan resolution. (The lights on the device start flashing.) Oh, damn. Enterprise, mark. Enterprise! (And they're beamed away in the nick of time.) [Sickbay] (Archer, T'Pol and Stel enter.) What kind of anomaly? And there's no way to get word to him. According to the security log, this is when T'Pau's biometric signature was recorded. There must be a stimulant you can inject him with, something to bring him around just for a few minutes.
Did you tell him about the Captain and T'Pol? Probably should've skipped breakfast this morning. [Bridge] That was no thermal. (two Vulcan patrol ships are attacking them) The plasma-cannons are still working, but I can't say the same for the targeting sensors. It doesn't seem to be affecting them. I'll have to aim manually. Can you get us on their tail? (one quick loop-the-loop later, the pod shoots at the Vulcans) How are they still below us? We have to abort. You won't be able to get us back up. Andoria?
I've got two teams working on it. Both launchers should be online in a few hours. Permission to speak freely? Admiral Gardner ordered us to return to Earth, yet we've set a course for Andorian territory. Have you told Starfleet you're planning to warn the Andorians? Have you any idea what the Admiral will do when he finds out? The Vulcans have legitimate reasons for launching this strike. If we alert the Andorians, we will be betraying our closest ally. With all due respect, sir, we shouldn't get involved. Sir? The Ambassador seems to be missing. He's not on board. There's a Vulcan signature on their lead ship. Can we compensate for the flux? Direct hit to their shield generator. Are you sure this is wise? If the Vulcans find us here, they might think we're siding with the Andorians. There's no guarantee they won't fire on us. The Vulcans are powering weapons. The Andorians are doing the same. The Vulcans, they're locking weapons. No, just the Andorians. We're in the crossfire. A Vulcan cruiser's heading towards them. We're not making a dent in their shields. (A pair of Andorian ships drive the Vulcans away.) Hull plating's gone. The launchers aren't responding. The Vulcans are keeping him busy. Looks like we really are on our own. [High Command] The Vulcan ships, they're withdrawing.
No. (He points somewhere else then hands over a weapon.) REED: I'll take up. You take down. [Bridge] Sickbay! Crewman down in the Armoury! (He rushes to Burrows, turns him over and sees that half his face is now a squidgy mess.) [Transporter alcove]
I confirm a positive seal.
Bridge to Captain Archer. I believe we've found the Andorian ship, sir.
Shut off the radiation! I wired it directly into the power conduit. (There's a very big bang, the hull of the modified warbird is breached, and the monitors in the control area revert to the Romulan symbol as Nijil's console goes blank.) We're both here, Captain. [Control area]
So, there really was no one on that ship. The Aenar compound is surrounded by a dampening field. Once you're inside, you won't be able to contact the ship. I'd feel much better about this if you'd take a couple of MACOs with you. Captain, we don't know anything about these people. Another ship's approaching, bearing oh one six mark twelve. An Andorian battle cruiser. They've stopped firing. [Telepathic conversation] They're attacking each other. Aye, sir. [Control area]
Who did this? A transporter signature? Still, it's a likely explanation. He was a loudmouth in a bar. I doubt he could find his head with both hands, never mind organise a kidnapping. Computer, access satellite logs one three seven. Time parameters nineteen hundred and nineteen forty five today. (The screen says grid 137 was offline for maintenance.) What? Starfleet Operations, this is Lieutenant Malcolm Reed aboard Enterprise. Please acknowledge. Sir? I thought I was calling Starfleet Ops. Something like that. Am I to understand you are responsible for taking that satellite grid offline? But you're involved. Phlox is my friend. Do you know where he is? I wasn't aware that I was still a part of your section. They may have dropped to impulse. No, sir. I'll have to bring aboard some of the debris and analyse it. Computer, establish an encrypted comm.-link. Starfleet frequency seven nine baker. You told me the Klingons were going to rendezvous with that freighter, not destroy it. How many were on board that ship? Yes. I'm not certain how much longer I can keep this from him. You want me to lie again? I could explain the situation to the Captain. I've worked closely with the man. You can trust him. I'm being compromised, sir, and I don't like it. I believe we're under attack. [Bridge] (A Klingon ship is attacking them.) He must have been surgically altered to look human. It might've been a safeguard, in case it fell into the wrong hands. I'm not quite sure what you're getting at, sir. I agree. It is a bit of a mystery. There's no doubt. With all due respect, sir, it must have been a mistake. Someone could have tampered with them. Respectfully, sir, I refuse to answer any more questions. I have no idea where the Doctor is, Captain. On that, you have my word. I'm not working for the Klingons. Captain, There are some obligations that go beyond my loyalty to you and this crew. (Archer gestures the MACO to leave them alone.) I can't say any more. I wouldn't know, sir. [Laboratory] So, what are you in for? I shouldn't think so. That's a long story. I lied to him. Why did you and your men board Enterprise? You know, you may find this hard to believe but, you and I actually want the same thing. A cure. There's no reason for you or any more of your people to die. [Bridge] Captain. You need your tactical officer. Please, sir. I can be useful! (But Archer just storms out of the Brig.) [Engineering]
Or Chef'll know who to blame for the mess in the Galley. Understood. [Launch bay]
You need something to do? The other two rooms are right next door. I'll show you in a moment. [Navaar's quarters]
(in MACO uniform) The Booth will be far more effective than our previous disciplinary methods. Well, that's what's so exceptional about this device. Traditional forms of punishment can overwhelm the nervous system. After a time, the brain ceases to feel anything. I'm not certain. I suspect he was late for his duty shift. Aren't all Tellarites guilty of something? (Forrest leaves, and Archer scurries after him.) [Corridor] Sir, let me take him down to the Cargo bay. I'll finish him quickly, quietly. Still, it'd be tragic if there was an accident on the way to the Brig. (Archer slams Reed against the bulkhead.) Perfectly, sir. [Bridge] (T'Pol is slouched in the Captain's chair, naked midriff fully on display and hair down below her shoulders.) Captain on the Bridge. There's one biosign aboard. Tholian. He's seen us. He's arming weapons. Done. It wasn't my doing, sir. I targeted his weapons only. Captain. (The Tholian ship explodes.) A distress signal. You think it has a comm. device in there? Sir, I recommend we beam it into space immediately. There are dozens of EPS feeds on this deck, and the only one that overloads is the one connected to the cloaking device. The saboteur entered this junction and deliberately overloaded this EPS waveguide. The intruder alarms were disabled. There's only one way I know of. By running a high-level diagnostic scan. Commander Tucker initiated a scan thirty minutes before the overload. [Agony booth] I'd like to see you try. It's likely the crew was executed. If you'd like, sir, I could hold that for you. (So Archer puts it in his belt.) [Decon Chamber] (The Tholian has started making noises again.)
Acknowledged. He's modified a communicator to emit a false biosign. Acknowledged.
Reed.
 (detaining Gannet) She's not here to do a story on Enterprise, Travis. She's a spy.
