Not yet!  [Maquis ship] (The little ship takes a direct hit from the Kazon. It streams flames.)
Then what happened? Don't worry, Lieutenant. I'll take care of this. I've confined her to quarters. Formal charges? Come on, Tuvok. We're seventy five years away from the nearest court. Are you really going to hold her in the brig for that long? Well, I'd like to settle this on my own without filing charges and without involving the Captain. She's a Maquis, and in the Maquis, sometimes you have to push people out of your way to get things done. Look, Lieutenant, I don't have to explain myself to you. I'll deal with B'Elanna personally, and then I'll inform the Captain. You're to drop this matter. That's an order. You do that. (The doors close and Tuvok walks away. Chakotay gets out on another floor and is joined by two of his Maquis crew.) I don't know yet but I'll handle it. Not true. What does that mean? If I ever hear you talk that way again, I'll personally throw you in the brig for mutiny.  [Torres's Quarters] (B'Elanna is pacing like a caged tiger. The doorbell rings and she throws a bowl at it. The door opens and the bowl just misses Chakotay.) Here. (Chakotay hands her a PADD.) The medical report on Lieutenant Carey. I don't want to hear it! You might be interested to know that the impact fractures along his cranium were pretty severe. If you'd hit him just a little harder, you could have driven some of those bones into his cerebellum. So on the one side, I'm facing a Vulcan who wants court-martial you. And on the other, I'm facing all the Maquis who are ready to seize this ship over this. You've turned this into one lousy day for me, Torres. Rest of the trip. Seventy five years. Or I could send you back to work with the understanding that you'll apologise to Not just a simple apology. A personal one, over a hot cup of pejuta. Bond with the man. You're going to need support from people like Carey. You are if you're going to be Chief Engineer of this ship. This is not another example of my twisted sense of humour. You're a better engineer than he is. She hasn't said a word, because I haven't told her yet. Captain's log, Stardate 48439.7. As we maintain a course back to the Alpha Quadrant, we're conducting what would normally be routine maintenance to the ship. Routine, that is, if we had access to a starbase.  [Briefing Room] Captain, if we relocate all security personnel to deck seven, we can shut down power on deck nine and reroute it to propulsion. I've made a list of several Maquis crew members who would make good officers. (Chakotay passes her his PADD.) That's right. Chief Engineer. Very. Perhaps we should assign somebody to train with the hologram as a field medic. Bridge to Torres. We need a way to get that ship out of there. Any ideas? A subspace tractor beam? When can you have it ready? Get right on it. Use as many people as you need. Captain, I appreciate your concerns about Torres, but I promise you Me? In what way? I've worked with her. I know what she's capable of. We needed an answer right away and I knew she could give us one. If you look at it that way, none of my people will ever have seniority. I'm doing everything I can to integrate them into your crew, but frankly, you're not making it easy for me, Captain. But some of them, like B'Elanna Torres have the ability. You're asking them to accept me. Permission to speak freely. I have no intention of being your token Maquis officer. B'Elanna Torres. She's the best engineer I've ever known. She could teach at the Academy. You're right, Captain. I do consider these my people because nobody else on this ship will look out for them like I will. And I'm telling you, you're going to have to give them more authority if you want their loyalty. I'm trying to help you. I'm sorry you don't see that. I strongly recommend you get to know Torres before you choose a new Chief Engineer. Permission to leave. What's going on? Are we abandoning the rescue attempt? It looks like we're running into more spatial distortions. Who will represent Engineering? You should invite B'Elanna Torres as well, unless you've removed her from consideration. B'Elanna, do you think you can work with Mister Carey to clean up that signal? That's your hail. Are you saying we're the ones trapped in the singularity? Hold our position! Mister Tuvok, report. Mister Paris, as soon as we've recovered the shuttlecraft, lay in a course toward the rupture and take us out. We're almost to the rupture. Mister Paris is about to impress us with his piloting skills. There they are. Your staff. First order of the day. The Captain wants the warp drive back online by thirteen hours. Then maybe you need to go break a few noses, or at least bend a few. Lieutenant. (Chakotay leaves.) Are you checking up on your new Chief Engineer? And? Can I ask you a question, off the record? If things had happened differently, and we were on the Maquis ship now instead of Voyager, would you have served under me? (They walk down the steps to main engineering.)
Go ahead. Captain, can you read us? (Terla rips off her comm. badge.) Chakotay to Janeway, can you read me? Please respond. [On the way to the Power plant]
Bridge to Captain Janeway. We're approaching the rogue planetoid, Captain. Keep looking. [Tunnel 3] Go ahead. Don't go any further [Tunnel] Let me guess, nothing there. Rendezvous at the Neelix, I said get back here! Neelix, did you hear what I said? Voyager to Captain Janeway. We've just picked [Bridge] Sorry, Captain. They went into warp too quickly.
Bridge to Janeway. You must not discuss with me what you see, or you will offend your animal guide. As you continue to look around, you will become aware of other life that shares this place with you. It will be the first animal you see. That is the one you will speak to. Do you see an animal? (There is a lizard on a sandy log.) Speak to it. You know what you want to ask. [Ready room] (The doorbell brings her back with a jolt.) All personnel report to stations. Yellow alert. Sorry.  [Bridge]
But is it stable enough for us to enter, and if it is, where does it lead? If that's a wormhole, it must be the smallest one on record. Any idea yet where that message would end up, Ensign? I'm reading transmission of the test signal. The probe has received it and relayed it. Even if someone receives our signal, it might take them some time to figure out how to return it. Why would he have broken off transmission? If he's engaged in some kind of secret research he might want to conceal that fact. Aye, Captain. [Doctor's office] (Janeway enters Sickbay. The place is deserted.) With pleasure, Captain. (Torres runs in.) If it's successful, we'd like to try transmitting a test cylinder to you. Energise. [Transporter Room] Kim and Torres have made more than twenty transports of the test cylinder, even though she's still having trouble with that phase variance. Every one of them has been successful. But this is 2371. I'm afraid that's not possible either. We've already had a huge impact on this quadrant. People and events here would be drastically affected.
Go ahead. Aye, Captain. [Ready room] Captain to the Bridge. Voyager to Tuvok. Mister Paris has regained consciousness. I thought you'd want to know. Chakotay to Tuvok. You're needed on the Bridge. We're under attack by Numiri patrols.
Others no longer than a few days. In fact, one body arrived less than twelve hours ago. I don't know, Captain. [Cavern] I recommend we leave these bodies in peace, Captain. [Cavern] I understand the chance for scientific discovery, Captain [Cavern] Captain [Cavern] There's a vacuole forming on deck thirteen. Magnetic interlocks are stable.
Bridge to Captain Janeway. Captain, we're receiving a distress call in one of the lower subspace bands.
Go ahead, Captain. He wants to make. I'm trying to talk him out of it. Acknowledged. [Planet Surface] Acknowledged [Planet Surface] Chakotay to Seska.
Captain, we haven't found any definite signs of Harry, but we've encountered several holodeck characters who claim to know what happened to him. Aye, Captain. Chakotay out. [Holodeck - Great Hall] How could it be in the holodeck? Hold on, Captain. [Holodeck - Great Hall]
Yes. I'm a little dizzy, but I think I'm all here. After the attack on the shuttle, I had the sensation of floating above my own body. I thought I was dead. Yes. I couldn't speak, I couldn't touch anything. But then I found if I concentrated on someone who was in the room with me, I could share their consciousness. At first I could only do little things with the host's body. Push buttons, work a console. As time went on, it became easier to do more. I'm sorry I had to knock you around, Tuvok. To be honest, I feel like I never left. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Senior officers please report to the bridge. One minute we were reading an empty tunnel, and the next we walked [Tunnels]
Understood.
We're experiencing [Bridge]
Chakotay to Sickbay. Is the Doctor all right? Good work. As soon as you're finished there I want all senior officers to report to the bridge.
I'm fine, Paris. Belay that, Voyager. Stand by. [Cave] Correct. [Cave] Chakotay out. [Cave] Chakotay to Away team. Captain, proceed with caution. I've been taken prisoner by a young Kazon. He's threatening to kill me.
Tuvok, can you boost the transporter signal? Aye, Captain. We think your shuttlecraft was caught in some kind of temporal anomaly. Yes, you could call it that.
Mister Kim, please report to the Bridge. Chakotay to crew. Battle stations. [Cave]
Bridge to the Captain. We've been hailed by a representative of the Bothan government. They'd like to talk to you.
Then all we need to do is locate these people and get their permission. You'd think [Clearing] Very odd. Like the flash of a memory, but it's someone I've never met. No. [Clearing]
Chakotay to Engineering. We're picking up life signs. Is your compass working? That looks a lot like the Caretaker's array. Shields! (Energy pulses, like the ones the Caretaker used to power the Ocampa's underground habitat, fire at Voyager. Boom!) Definitely weapons. Kes, is there any Ocampa history about people who left your planet, or were captured by aliens and taken away? None of that is true. We never attacked anyone except in self defence. Does she occupy our space-time continuum? What's going on? Red alert. Bridge to Janeway. Bridge to Janeway. Increase power to structural reinforcement.
There may be intruders in Transporter Room two.
Not yet. How bad is it? Options? I don't want to leave the ship defenceless this close to a hostile planet. All right, power down the shields. Yes, Neelix. Did you get the tellerium? Then we need you here. Prepare to beam directly to Engineering. Chakotay to away team. Captain, can you hear me? Tuvok, Torres, please respond. Begin rerouting power back to all key systems. What happened down there? Are you sure it was the Mokra? Any idea how the Mokra knew you were down there? Could your contact be one of them? They've probably got the resistance movement under surveillance. Good work, Mister Kim. Mister Neelix, you're with me. I think it's time we contacted the Mokra. [Bridge] Mister Paris, set a new course. Bring us out from behind the moon and establish a standard orbit around the planet. Slowly. We don't want to look aggressive. What kind of response can we expect when they see us? On screen. Commander Chakotay of the Federation starship Voyager. No. Some of my crewmembers have already been to the surface. We've lost contact with them. I have reason to believe they're being detained. Thank you. If there's any chance for a diplomatic solution, we have to pursue it. In the meantime, I want continuous scans of the surface. Standard search pattern. [Detention cell] (Torres is examining the yellow glowing barrier around the doorway.) I assure you we have no hostile intentions. But not you. Then I'd like to talk to my crewmembers. I'll consider that, after I talk to my crewmembers. Talk to your contacts again. I want an alternative to sitting here waiting for him to get back to us. [Detention cell] Can you find a way to beam through them? The Mokra aren't familiar with transporter technology. Too dangerous. We can't risk beaming in. We have to find another way that the Mokra won't detect. Sounds like a challenge for you, Mister Kim. [Market place] So much for a surprise attack. And they won't know where to concentrate their defences. Then it'll have to do. How long will it take to modify the deflector? Chakotay to Paris. Is the rescue team ready? Prepare for transport. Initiate the radion beams. Begin the transport. Maximum shields. Damage report. On screen. Give me some good news, Mister Kim. That qualifies. Good work. Can we get through? That's a big assumption. In about thirty seconds the Mokra are going to open fire. I don't know how long we're going to be able to wait for you. Full power to the shields. (Boom!) Modulate the shield frequencies. Try to throw off their sensors. Redirect all warp power to the shields. We've got to get out of their weapons range. Scan one more time for the away team. Prepare to break orbit. Where are you taking us, Mister Kim? A blind spot? How long do you thing this'll work. I'll take every second I can get. [Prison complex] Chakotay to transporter room two. Do we have them? Gladly. Lieutenant, you heard her. [Ready room]
Captain, someone's initiating a transport. It's Torres and the robot. Their shielding is making it difficult to get clear readings. I can't even tell you what their weapons capabilities are. They're firing some kind of quantum resonance charges, Captain. We've got to get out of here. Injury reports from all decks. [Pralor vessel] We're losing life support, Captain. We're talking about at least another six days of repairs. But if we can manoeuvre inside the field Attack them again? You don't mind if the rest of us give you a little help, do you, Paris? I'd hate to lose another shuttle. We're making progress on the dilithium matrix. It should be stable enough to reinitialise the warp core in about six hours. When we were in the Maquis, B'Elanna once linked a holo-emitter to a deflector array and projected an image of another ship into space. We will by the time the warp core's online. I already have Kim working on the holodeck to We've got to get Torres back now. It didn't work. He bounced right off the field.
It's trajectory is erratic, and our sensors aren't detecting any stellar or planetary gravitational fields that could account for its motion. And yet it looks, feels, and tastes just like a comet. Captain? I'm showing a large build-up of baryonic particles. By a ship? How about Stellar Cartography? Well, that's going to be a problem with just about everything we assign him to.
We're on it. (Neelix, Janeway, Tuvok and Mabus are beamed away. The Trabe ship starts shooting at an apparently empty room. Voyager fires three photon torpedoes that explode in the atmosphere above it, and it flies away. The Kazon Majes get up from their hiding places and leave.) [Transporter room]
Paris broke out of confinement in Engineering. [Bridge]
Suder, what are you doing with a comm. badge?
I haven't seen many weapons that could do that kind of damage to a duritanium hull. Continuous scans, Lieutenant. We don't want whoever did this to catch us by surprise. [Engineering] Afraid so. Probably the same way we did. Originally the Cardassians sent this thing to destroy a Maquis munitions base. We nicknamed it Dreadnought. It's a self-guided tactical missile carrying a charge of a thousand kilos of matter and another thousand of antimatter. We didn't. It got through all our defences. Worked like it was supposed to except for one minor detail. It didn't go off. The missile skipped off into the atmosphere and quietly went into orbit. And we gave it a new mission. To destroy the Cardassian fuel depot on Aschelan Five. But it never made it out of the Badlands. We thought it had been destroyed in one of the plasma storms. Lieutenant. I expect everyone to show up for meetings on time and properly dressed. (Paris nearly says something, then changes his mind.) On screen. It's not supposed to do that until it's locked onto it's final target. The planet is Class M. I'm reading several heavily populated areas. [Secret location] The Dreadnought's quantum torpedoes could be modified to be compatible with our launchers. We should also download some files from the computer core. We're back on a heading to Rakosa Five. At this rate it'll reach the planet in fifty one hours. (Later.) Torres programmed the missile's shields to adjust to all known weapons, even Starfleet's. It must have scanned our weapons, adapted its shields. To work, it would take more energy than all of our photons put together. I'm not leaving you on the ship. Everyone except senior officers, with me. (Chakotay leaves.)
Captain, have you decided who's going to replace Paris? They're made from a substance known as verterium cortenide. Do you know where we can find a source? What initial investigation? Captain, what's going on? Plan. Are you saying Paris's insulting behaviour, the gambling, being late for duty, mouthing off at me, was all a ruse? And the reason I wasn't let in on this little plan? In other words, you didn't trust me. Could it be Hogan? That would put Neelix in a potentially dangerous situation.
This is the third time you've been late this week, Mister Paris. What's the source? Slow to half impulse. She may be too sick.  According to her ship's navigational logs, the woman was en route to a remote Vidiian colony. It's about ten light years away. We should be in the general vicinity in about twenty two days. Captain. I wanted to talk to you about Lieutenant Paris. His attitude lately has been less than professional. I know crew discipline's my responsibility, but in this case I thought I should let you get involved before I took any action. In a way, Paris has been your personal reclamation project.  Mind if I join you? So how are things, Tom? How have you been feeling lately? Something bothering you? Well, you've been moody lately, indifferent to your duties. To be honest, you don't seem to be taking your job very seriously. If you've got a problem, I'd like to know what it is. You care to elaborate? What's that supposed to mean? Look, sometimes I'm not going to agree with your suggestions. But making decisions is part of being a leader. Maybe someday you'll understand that. I didn't come here for a lecture from you on how to do my job. Sure, Paris. You're excused. [Secret location] LORRUM That's all right, Mister Paris. We don't need you. Mister Grimes has taken your place at conn. Not today it isn't. That's right. When you decide to start taking your job seriously, we'll discuss it. But right now, you're dismissed. (Chakotay turns Paris around.)
You know, I didn't expect to be this nervous. It's not even my child. Captain? My father had a saying, Captain. Home is wherever you happen to be. Sounds like we're headed right into their territory.  What was that? We have just barely enough. Stand by. I'm having trouble with the alignment module. I've got alignment. Magnetising the hull. (Shudder.) I think it worked. The magnetic field is collapsing. The hull is depolarising! (Bang!) Everybody out! Go, go, go! Hurry, Captain! Captain! Captain, let's go! (Note to There are two Voyagers and two crews? They may be able to do that, but we barely have enough power for life support. How can we get enough to send an energy pulse of that size? Aye, Captain. Can you identify them? Still off-line. [Voyager 2 - Bridge] JANEWAY Maybe they hit the other Voyager. Captain, the Vidiian ship has been destroyed. So has the other Voyager. Captain's log, stardate 49548.7. There are no signs of any pursuing Vidiian vessels, and we have resumed a course toward home. [Sickbay]
Aye Captain. (The shuttlecraft is launched.)
Chakotay to all senior officers. Please report to the Bridge.
Not yet. We're having some trouble with the transporter. There's no evidence of any type of alien interference. Frankly, Captain, we're at a loss. Captain, I recommend we programme a holodeck simulation. Try recreating the accident. Tuvok said it could take up to ten days to check out all the possible problems. How'd you fix it so fast? There's an old axiom. The whole is never greater than the sum of its parts. I think Tuvix might be disproving that notion. [Planet surface] Best out of five? (Kes enters.) Not at all. (Paris takes Tuvix's cue.) Of course not. I count myself as one of them. Until the Captain makes a decision, Mister Tuvix is still the tactical officer. (Janeway comes out of her Ready room and goes to Tactical.)
What about keeping us in stasis aboard Voyager? It's risky. The Vidiians have never shown any willingness to help us. It's more likely they'd attack Voyager and try to harvest body parts from the crew. Could we live with ourselves, knowing we sent Voyager into that kind of danger? It looks like they transported the contents of the whole ship. Do you really think you can find a cure? Does it matter which way these things go? That's not much of a choice. Couldn't Starfleet have come up with something a little more cheerful? I was thinking more of a tasteful pinstripe, something in blues and greens. Well, I suggest we put the grey on the outside and the beige inside. Roughing it? Let's see, we have shelter, furniture, research equipment, tricorders, a replicator. It's too rough for me. A bathtub? Captain, I'm sure you can learn to love the sonic shower. Give me a few days on that one, okay? [Engineering] Catch anything? Oh, in the woods. Not yet. It means when it's time for you to know, I'll tell you. I'm building something. You can't stand it, can you? You're like a little kid wheedling. Can't hurt to give it a try. [Outside the shelter] (There is a rustle in the nearby bushes. Janeway grabs a towel.) I've detected primate life signs here, but I've never seen one. Looking for a pet? Well, excuse me. [Shelter] Kathryn, the Doctor worked for weeks trying to find a treatment for this disease. You've been at it twelve hours a day, seven days a week since we got here, and we're still no closer to a cure than we were the day we were infected. My people have a saying. Even the eagle must know when to sleep. Maybe it's time we both considered that. Why do you have to see it as defeat? Maybe it's simply accepting what life has dealt us, finding the good in it. Making headboards. I've noticed you sometimes sit up in your bed to read. I figured you might as well have a comfortable backrest. But what I do makes you uncomfortable, doesn't it? Every time I do something that adds a personal touch to the shelter, you resist it. I can't sacrifice the present waiting for a future that may never happen. The reality of this situation is that we may never leave here. So, yes, I'm trying to make a home. Something that's more than a plain, grey box. Kathryn! Kathryn. Are you hurt? Give it to me. It seems to be some kind of plasma storm. Our tricorders don't recognise it, but it sure packs a wallop! [Ready room] I'm sorry. I've been thinking. There's plenty of wood available here. I could probably add rooms to the shelter, give us a little more living space. I could do a certain amount with a phaser, but I was actually thinking of logs. I built a few of them when I was growing up. My father thought it was important that I learn how. No bathtub. Well, maybe those camping trips helped prepare you for life here. I think that's the first time I've heard you say anything positive about being here. (The primate chatters at them.) Do you expect him to answer you? I doubt that he can be domesticated, at least not very easily. (The primate climbs a tree.) That's a long time. At least I hope so. Aye, aye, Captain. [Shelter] (Janeway's shoulder's ache.) Here, let me help. (He strokes her hair, moves it out of the way, then starts massaging.) I've had a lot of practice at this. My mother used to get sore necks all the time. I was the only one she'd trust not to make it worse. (After a very long moment, Janeway stands up.) Sleep well, Kathryn. All right. I'm not sure I can define parameters. But I can tell you a story, an ancient legend among my people. It's about an angry warrior who lived his life in conflict with the rest of his tribe, a man who couldn't find peace, even with the help of his spirit guide. For years, he struggled with his discontent. But the only satisfaction he ever got came when he was in battle. This made him a hero among his tribe, but the warrior still longed for peace within himself. One day he and his war party were captured by a neighbouring tribe led by a woman warrior. She called on him to join her because her tribe was too small and weak to defend itself from all its enemies. The woman warrior was brave and beautiful and very wise. The angry warrior swore to himself that he would stay by her side, doing whatever he could to make her burden lighter. From that point on, her needs would come first. And in that way, the warrior began to know the true meaning of peace. No. But that made it easier to say. [Bridge] (Fighting a running battle against three ships.) How are they coming? I would never have thought of you as a gardener. Did you hate that as much as camping? If your tomatoes could spare you for a minute, I'd like your opinion on something in the house. Really? [Shelter] (Chakotay shows her a schematic on the desk computer.) What do you think? You said you wanted to explore the river. I think I could build this. I'm not sure we could fit the bathtub in the boat. Yes. (He goes to a shelf and gets the comm. badges.) Ready? (The primate turns up.) Aye, Captain. I'll have a report to you by eighteen hundred hours. Yes, ma'am. I'll see to it. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

 This is not my responsibility! She has no right to expect me to I have a duty to this crew. I can't just leave and go looking for the child. Do you think it's a trap? On the other hand, it was time for her to deliver, and that baby we saw did look part Cardassian and part human. Still, the safest thing would be to ignore this message and resume our course. A-koo-chee-moya. We are far from the sacred places of our grandfathers. We are far from the bones of my people. But I ask, on this day of sorrow and uncertainty, that the wisdom of my father find me and help me understand my dilemma. Speak to me, Father. Speak to me in my dreams. I have a son, Father. Yes, but I'm not sure I'm willing to be a father to him. He was born without my consent. I had no part in it. My DNA was taken from me, used by a woman to impregnate herself without my permission. It's more than that. How do you take a child into your heart who is forced upon you by a mother's deception? No. If these ships can fool the Kazon, it's worth it. Uh, excuse me, but there is one more thing. Thank you. [Bridge]  It's not Culluh's ship. Looks more like a shuttle. I know this man. His name's Teirna. He's one of Seska's aides. She had him work me over when I was on their ship. What about the child? We'll be needing your help getting to the Gema system. Under the circumstances, I'd say you don't have much of a choice. [Doctor's office]  What's his prognosis? Polycythemia? I'd like you to run an autonomic response analysis the next time I question him. Have you found anything at all that would cast doubt on his story? I still don't trust him. [Briefing room] We might have more success avoiding him if you gave us the command codes for the Nistrim defence net. Feeling better? You're still not optimistic about our chances, are you? We've had no problem repelling the attacks so far. You still have pride in the Nistrim, don't you, Teirna? Even after what they did to you. I remember that pride in your eyes when you pounded me with your fists while I was tied to a chair. And I can see it in your eyes now, and that scares the hell out of me. Tell me something, Teirna. Every Kazon attack seems to focus on our starboard ventral. Think that might be some kind of pattern? Because if it is, and you've been lying to us Starboard ventral. Stand down Red alert. We barely have time to begin repairs before they attack it again. Why would these factions of Kazon, loyal to no one, all have the same agenda? And why would that agenda focus on a nonessential area of the ship? We can't just stay on this course and wait to see what they have in store for us. Mister Teirna should be restricted to quarters on a secured deck until further notice. Funny how they show up right after we reverse course. They took the bait. I like those odds better than eight to one. Deck eight. Teirna's quarters. Evasive manoeuvres, Mister Paris. Gamma sequence. Navigational array is offline. Intruder alert. Security to decks five through seven. May he grow up never knowing the contempt his father has for his mother. What? Is that what she told you? What's in the Hanon system? A clearing with a protected side like the base of a cliff would be best. That includes anything that can be used as a tool or a weapon. All right, start dividing the crew. Looks like we don't have much daylight left. We'll spread the teams out in a standard alpha search pattern to see what we have to work with. At first glance, it's an M-class planet in a Pliocene stage of evolution. Let me help you. Don't push yourself. That goes for everyone. Perspiring wastes water. (He takes the baby from her. There is a ground tremor. Captain Janeway leads them through a gap in the rocks.) That's all that's left of Hogan's uniform, Captain. We didn't find anything else. I know it sounds grisly, but I can make solar stills with the material from this uniform. We could have water tomorrow. Trapped on a barren planet and you're stuck with the only Indian in the universe who can't start a fire by rubbing two sticks together. I was never good at this as a child and I'm still not good at it. We need kindling of some sort. (He stares at the Captain.) Something my father once told me about starting a fire. (A short time later, all the long-haired crew have had to sacrifice a lock to the cause. Kim gets to cut Janeway's hair.)  There are signs of a struggle near the edge of camp. I found alien tracks. Well, I'm better at tracking than starting fires. This is thoughtful of you Tuvok, but my tribe never used bows and arrows, and I've never even shot one. Are you all right? Have you been able to tell if they have a leader? Listen to the sound of my voice, and you'll know that I mean you no harm. I come without weapons. But I must have my people back. (The chief silences the males and talks to Chakotay.) Thank you, but she should stay with you. I must take them with me. Kes, stand up slowly and walk away with us. (Neelix and Kes walk away as Chakotay faces the chief.) We have to go now. (He follows Kes and Neelix up the slope.) Just keep walking. Don't look back. In there! I know. If they know it too, they won't follow us in. Come on! (He is right.) [Engineering] (Cullah is watching from the top walkway. Seska is on the one below.) Come on. We have to see if there's another way out of here. (Further along, there is a small rock fall after a tremor.)  Which way do you like, Tuvok? All right, let's take it slow. Single file. [Outside the tunnel] (Torres, Ayala and a crewwoman throw rocks at the natives.) Go! [Tunnel] (They run back to the entrance. The serpent follows.) Everybody out! [Outside the tunnel] Go, go, go! [Outside the tunnel] Come on. [Jefferies Tube] KAZON I agree with the Captain. We have to find a way to share this world with them. I don't believe that. (Kes runs out to them.) It's okay. (He puts her over his shoulder and carries her back up to safety. The chief is impressed.)
Captain, forgive me, but you've never been one to put much trust in religious ceremonies. Exactly what is it you hope to accomplish? Some kind of physiological change, maybe. We'll have to find a way to allow the Doctor to monitor your physical condition, and you should have a way to call for an emergency beam out if you need it. As a precaution. We don't have any idea what the ritual entails. Of course there's always the possibility that the Ancestral Spirits really do control what happens in the shrine. I remember when my mother taught me the science underlying the vision quest. In a way I felt disappointed. Some of the mystery was gone. Maybe the Nechani have chosen not to lose the mystery. What does that mean? Is she in danger? Then there's nothing so far that would suggest a treatment for Kes. It's been three days since she had any sleep. How long are we going to let her go through this? She's been poisoned by some unknown toxin. It may be having an effect we can't gauge. It could lie dormant for a few days and then suddenly fluctuate and kill her in minutes. Are you getting enough meaningful information to justify her continuing this ordeal? Then is it possible she's in no condition to activate the homing signal? All right, we'll leave her there for now, but I'm not moving from this monitor until she gets back. [Coastline] (Waves rolling onto a rocky shore with a cliff behind Janeway.) How does that translate into a cure for Kes? Captain, if you'll excuse me, I'm probably more useful on the bridge right now. (Chakotay leaves.) Captain, we've been worried about you. Acknowledged. I'll bring her down myself. Chakotay to sickbay. Doctor, prepare Kes for transport. The Doctor says her life signs are deteriorating. He almost wouldn't let us take her out of sickbay. You have some new information on the effects of the field? Captain, you've been through a lot in the past few days. Are you sure of that? There are eight hundred megajoules of biogenic energy running through that shrine. The thoron radiation levels are off the scale. That's what you'd be taking yourself and her into. Why don't you take some time to think about this and let us run a few more scans. Captain, this isn't like you. He's right. It's my responsibility to keep you safe, for the crew's sake if not for your own. I'd rather not have to relieve you of duty, but if your judgment's been impaired in any way. Captain, I don't understand this.
From the dispersal pattern of the interstellar plasma, it looks like it isn't fixed. Seems to be travelling through space. Aye, Captain. Hard to believe, isn't it? (An older man in a long robe, and wearing a patch over his right eye, enters the square declaiming a poem.) It was very nice. I'm sorry. Not today. We've really got to be going. Tom? I'm picking up a narrow band EM dampening field around that building. It looks like some sort of temple. What do you mean, wearing your ears? Must be some sort of fetish. Greed is eternal. Chakotay to Voyager. We've found the replicator, Captain.  It seems the people have a myth, an epic poem called the Song of the Sages, which predicts the arrival of two demigods from the sky, the Sages, who would rule over the people as benevolent protectors. What they've done is co-opt the local mythology by using advanced technology like the replicator to convince the people that they're the two Sages spoken of in the poem. It's disgusting, Captain. The two Ferengi live in a palatial temple, while the people are lucky to have a roof over their heads. Now that we've found them, what are we going to do with them? But Arridor's right. We can't kidnap their gods either. The gods would be gone, but the people would be prepared for it, and they might accept it as a natural ordained occurrence. Let's get to the shuttle. (The Bard's eye patch has moved from the right to the left eye.) Your poem's very nice, but we're in a hurry. Tell me something. What happens to the Sages at the end of the Song? The Holy Pilgrim! The Holy Pilgrim! (The voices can be heard inside the vault.) Chakotay to Voyager. On my mark. [Bridge] Now. [Bridge] Stand back. (Chakotay phasers the generator.) [Town Square] (Neelix, Arridor and Kol are beamed away.) We're all here in one piece, Captain.  Acknowledged. Listen, friend, you're lucky to be alive. We beamed your shuttle to the shuttle bay. As for the rest of your possessions, they're back in the hands of the people you stole them from. Ensign Murphy, escort these men to secured quarters.  Murphy was escorting the Ferengi to their quarters. The gravitational effects of the wormhole are refracting the beam. I can't get a lock. Try setting the scanners to a narrowband subspace frequency. [Ferengi shuttle] (An alarm sounds.) Initiate a high intensity impulse burst.
The vultures are circling. Aye, Captain. Are you all right, Lieutenant?  So how are you feeling this morning? I didn't ask because I'm concerned about your ability to perform, I'm concerned about you. Sorry I asked. Maybe you should try to forget about it for a while. I've found that when you don't think about a problem, sometimes the solution comes to you. [Engineering] Good point. Mister Kim? Anything unusual about the nebula itself? Cloaked ships? Maybe you should go back to Sickbay. Tuvok? (Tuvok is back at the cliff.)
Captain, Ambassador Liria is hailing us. I'm sure the same could be said of anyone who was near the explosion. It's hardly enough evidence for a conviction. Aye, Captain. [Paris' hovel]  There's no indication they followed us. Our long range scans indicate that Liria was right. There's no trilithium in this sector.  We're in hailing range of the Akritirian freighter, Captain. I guess you're not the only captain who doesn't want their ship boarded. So much for negotiating.
B'Elanna. B'Elanna, wake up. Your duty shift started twenty minutes ago. I tried to reach you on the comm. but you didn't answer. Are you feeling all right? This is the second morning you've been late. I'm not concerned about the duty schedule, B'Elanna. If there's something wrong Ah, you mean fine like when you insisted on finishing the hoverball championship with a broken ankle? Intensely bad? So they're enjoyable. Stimulating. I don't suppose you've been dreaming about anyone in particular? One of our passengers? I'm sure. So I assume I won't have to write up a report on your chronic oversleeping? I know. You'll rip my heart out and eat it raw. Your secret's safe with me. [Corridor] (In smart casual wear, coming out of the turbolift.) Actually, I think she might have gone to bed early tonight. [B'Elanna's dream - Bedroom] (Korenna is getting a lecture from her father.) Can you get it done before we drop off the Enarans? Is there something else on your mind? In what way? B'Elanna It sounds like a holonovel. It can't be a coincidence that this is going on while we have a group of telepaths on board. Why don't you ask your friend in Engineering. I'll talk to the Captain. She should know anything that might involve our guests. And you have evidence that she was murdered?
What's that? I'd say over fifteen months even if we could sustain maximum warp, which we can't. They can't possibly have enough ships to patrol a border this size. We could probably find an unguarded section. Captain? I think we've found it. A way to get across the border without being detected. And we've found that this area shows no indication of their vessels. We can slide through, go to high warp and be through this narrow section of their territory in four days. That looks like thousands of ships. Maybe they haven't detected us. Mister Paris, take us through. If we can sustain that for twelve hours we'll be nearly a third of the way through. Red alert! Shields at maximum. Do you think they're trying to communicate? I'll say. As far as anyone's sensors are concerned we're lit up like a Christmas tree. How did that happen? Anything we fire is going to affect us instead of them. What about a photon torpedo? They're starting to drain our systems.
Red Alert! Captain Janeway to the bridge. [Bridge] Acknowledged, Captain.
Can we beam the passengers out through all that radiation? Bridge to Janeway. [Transporter Room one] Block it. Lock on the tractor beam. Target phasers at their engine core, just enough to knock out propulsion. Set a course to follow them. Acknowledged. You wouldn't think it was possible to make those adjustments so quickly. At some point your people must have rebelled. If this was meant to be a trap, why tell us about it? I'll cover you.
Chakotay here, Captain. [Bridge]  Bridge to Janeway. You'd better come in here, Captain.
Doctor [EMH narrative - Bridge] Can you treat him? No. [EMH narrative - Bridge] I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we can't take the chance.
Chakotay to Tuvok and Kim. Report to the bridge.
Can we plot a course around it? I have the station on sensors, Captain. Three point four light years away, heading oh seven one mark one seven. We were hoping to find some magnetic spindle bearings for our reaction control assembly. No. Neelix. I thought you'd like to say hello to your old friend. Mister Wix was able to find those magnetic spindle bearings we were looking for. I don't know what we'd have done if he hadn't come up them. I'll let you two reminisce for a while. Thanks again, Wix. Murder? What's the charge?
Is there anyone in the area who might consider this their  property?    She bit you?  You said she was going after the gallicite, so we'll do the  same and hope it leads us to her.  Let's go. [Cave] (There  is some light, water dripping and mosses growing. Torres scans the  rocks then moves a few to reveal a power cable and a flashing light.)  We'll send somebody down here to study it more closely. Right  now we've got to get you back to the ship.  My name is Chakotay. I assure you, we have no hostile intent.    B'Elanna, please.  We'd be glad to take her and leave your territory.  We only came to find some gallicite. We thought this planet  was uninhabited.  It's standard procedure for any mission into unfamiliar  territory.  I'd be glad to tell you all about my people and learn about  yours. There's no need to hold us here for interrogation.  As I said, we didn't know there was anyone down here.  That's something we can help you with.  We can show you how we detected the gallicite, so you can  disguise it better. We can also help you eliminate the last traces of  the ruins on the surface, so no one else will be curious about them.  Yes. I assume the Sakari once lived there.  I can certainly understand your caution, but let us  demonstrate our good faith by helping you protect yourselves. Then  we'll go and never bother you again.  Are you two all right?    Chakotay to Voyager. Please respond. Still nothing.  There must be some kind of communications problem. I'm sure  they'll clear it up soon.  Hold on, Tom. There's not going to be any challenge. Are you  responsible for the ship being out of contact?  Just hold on. Neither of you are thinking straight right now.    You mean let them fight?  All right.  I think there's something you should see, Captain. We found  this as we were clearing away the ruins. Undoubtedly, one of the  invaders who destroyed this colony.  (A skeleton with cybernetic skull and body implants.) 
Harry's clarinet solo was okay. I could have done without Tuvok's reading of Vulcan poetry. But the highlight of the evening was definitely Kathryn Janeway portraying the Dying Swan. I don't doubt it. If Neelix has another talent night I hope you reprise it. Me? Get up in front of people and perform? I don't think so. Sounds great. If I miss I get to be Captain. Atmospheric turbulence. We might be in for a rough landing. I'm reading even more severe storms near the surface. I think we took a lightning hit. Attitude control is out. The navigational system's out. I'll try the emergency anti-grav thrusters. (The shuttlecraft tumbles through the clouds. The next time we see it, it is on the ground, badly damaged. Chakotay revives to see Janeway lying on the floor.) Kathryn. Kathryn! (He checks her pulse.) Kathryn! Kathryn! (He gets out a medical tricorder and scans her. The beeps are not good.) No! Hang on, Kathryn. (He starts CPR.) Breathe, damn it. Breathe! Don't you die on me now. Come on, Kathryn. Breathe! Listen to me, Kathryn. You've got to breathe. Breathe! Breathe! Come on. Come on! (He gives her an injection and she gasps.) Yes. Don't ever do that to me again. You went into shock. You gave me quite a scare there for a minute. This should help reduce your cranial swelling. Should have a headache for a while. We need to set up a homing signal. Hey, take it easy. I can get them. You set up the homing signal. Here. At least the storm seems to be dying. (Chakotay runs back to the shuttlecraft, and Janeway starts work on her comm. badge with the tool Chakotay gave her.) There are phaser burns on the hull. I don't think it was lightning strikes that hit us. I think we were shot down. I don't know. I'm going back to see if I can get an energy signature from the burns. Disconnect it while I scan the shuttle. (She goes to join him.) The signatures are Vidiian. If they shot us down you can be sure they'll be coming for us. We need to find a hiding place. Life forms, fifty metres from here. They're coming this way. There's another group in this direction. We're surrounded. Harry's clarinet solo was okay. I could have done without Tuvok's reading of Vulcan poetry. But the highlight of the evening was definitely Kathryn Janeway portraying the Dying Swan. You're right. We have been here before. Yes. They shot us down and attacked us. Whatever's going on, let's change tactics this time. Let's not try to land on that planet. Or of Vidiian ships. Chakotay to Voyager. Chakotay to Voyager, do you read us? Is it Vidiian? I've got it. It's a warship, loaded with weaponry. It's closing fast. We can try. Setting evasive pattern Delta four. Shields down to eighty four percent. Nice aim. We've lost shields! That one hit the reactant injectors. The magnetic fields are failing. The gas flow separators are down. Let's retrace our steps. Get back to the part of space we were in before all this started happening. Let me guess. It's a Vidiian ship. Sacajawea to Voyager. Do you read us? We're being pursued by two Vidiian ships. Set a course for our shuttle and have weapons powered. If you're going to emit that tachyon burst, you'd better do it now. In a couple of minutes those ships'll be right on top of us. The Vidiians are almost within range. Ready weapons. What happened? Then those ships must have been part of the time loop. Not a minute too soon. I was getting awfully tired of talking about Talent Night. We were on our way to the second planet of a binary system. And then we were attacked by the Vidiians, but we managed to escape and get back here. But I don't remember anything about a repeating time loop. You heard the Captain. Let's get moving. [Sickbay] I know. We're back. (There is a bright light ahead of them.) It's exerting a gravito-magnetic force. Changing course. We're still being drawn toward it. Structural integrity is weakening. Captain, maybe we should go in. Listen to me. Maybe we're doing this all wrong. Maybe the thing to do is fly into it. It's going to tear the shuttle apart. The hull is breaching! [Planet surface] (Janeway watches Chakotay performing CPR on her.) Don't you die on me, Kathryn. Start breathing! Breathe, dammit. Breathe! Don't do this to me, Kathryn. Come on, Kathryn, breathe. Don't you die on me. Come on, breathe. Kathryn, listen to me, you have to breathe. Start breathing! Come on! Come on! (He scoops her up in his arms, weeping.) No, Kathryn! You can't die. Yes, Voyager. How far are you? I have an emergency here. The Captain's dead. We have to get her back to sickbay. The Doctor may still be able to revive her. Acknowledged. Kathryn, we're going to get you back. [Sickbay] (Chakotay is there while the EMH and Kes work on the dead Janeway. Janeway watches.) In the past Kes has shown an ability an unseen presence. I think we have to take her seriously. Get on it. It's your top priority. Neelix, help the crew with this. Keep their morale up until we can get some answers. Yes, sir. Right away. Good idea. Tom, we'll take duty stations. Would anyone else like to say something? I know this hasn't been easy, but I think we'll all be better for it. We will honour the Captain one last time. Release the pod. (A crewman blows a bosun's whistle as Janeway's torpedo casing coffin is sent out into space.) Ensign Kim was right when he said the Captain wouldn't want us to be sad. Neelix has prepared some food, and it would be nice if we could all get together and share the good times we had with Captain Janeway. She's coming back. Her eyes are open. Kathryn, hang on. We're bringing you back. Just fight a little longer. Fight it, Kathryn, just a little longer. Kathryn? You and I were caught in a magnetic storm and crashed here. You were badly injured. The Doctor just arrived on the shuttle with Tuvok and began treating you. But each time you seemed to fight back. Another place? Some kind of afterlife? I could have sworn I heard the Doctor tell you to take it easy for a few days. You shouldn't push yourself. You've been through a lot. I can understand that. I can't help thinking about it. That alien, his Matrix. He was like the spider that has to lure a fly into his web. That's a little hard to believe. I'm sure that's the case. After going head to head with Kathryn Janeway he must have realised he'd met his match. Like something worth living for. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc.

Are you saying we're lost, Ensign? Lost as in you can't get a fix on our position. Try hailing Voyager again. Then we'll just have to navigate the old-fashioned way. Engage optical scanners. I'm picking up an asteroid field at coordinates one one three mark seven. Record it. Great. We're not only lost, we're flying in circles. (Beeping.) Well, at least someone knows where we are. The signal's coming from the planet surface. Sensor readings are sketchy. I'm detecting about eighty thousand humanoid life forms on the western continent, some rudimentary structures and technology, but no energy signature big enough to be a starship. Try adjusting the bandwidth. This is Commander Chakotay of the Starship Voyager. Please identify yourself. They've identified us as a Federation ship. Whoever they are, they're asking for our help. Launch a message buoy letting Voyager know we've landed in response to a distress call. [Settlement] (Night. Fires burn in makeshift braziers.) I can't pinpoint the source of the transmission. (Four armed figures step out from the metal structures.) I'm Commander Chakotay of the Starship Voyager. We're responding to a distress call. We're looking for whoever it was who asked for our help. You're human. Why did you attack us? What did you do with Kaplan? I've got to get back to my shuttle. How did It's a long story. Why don't you go first. There are other humans here? And the ones who put you in stasis? Why did those people kill Kaplan? We were no threat to them. So those kind of attacks, they go on all the time? I've got to contact my ship. I can help you. It's delicious. No problem. I'm a vegetarian. About sixty seven years, provided we don't find a wormhole or some other faster way of getting back. We'd be missing an incredible opportunity to explore unknown space. Besides, we've made a good life for ourselves on Voyager. I'm sure Captain Janeway would be amenable to take as many of your people with us as we can accommodate. I assumed that's why you sent the distress call. But you were brought here against your will. You just said how dangerous it is. I can understand that, but What about those unfriendly neighbours of yours? I'll come with you. Hello? Anybody there? Riley? (He returns to the controls and finally hits the right ones. Sunlight streams in.) [Settlement] (There are people from many races here, all bald, some missing forearms. Chakotay sees a small group on the far side. One man with a Borg eye implant and cyborg forearm is working on another person with a metal plate at the back of their skull. That person turns around.) Riley? What are you? Are you Borg? You mean you weren't just kidnapped. You were assimilated by the Collective. And then? Why didn't you tell me all this in the first place? You'd been assimilated. You weren't in control of your actions. Would what be safe? Medical applications? This is all very fascinating, but I don't see how it helps me. I see. I thought you said the link was severed. You want to hook up my mind to some Borg collective! I'm not letting anyone implant some neural processor in my brain. Thanks, but I don't think so. I'll take my chances and wait for Voyager. Any sign of Voyager? It's either that or the Happy Hunting Grounds, huh? It was incredible. I heard all of you, your thoughts inside my head, as if they were my thoughts. And I could see myself through your eyes. I saw faces, planets. What were they? I know things about all of them, about you. You like bluebonnets. You used to pick them back home in Texas with a man who carried a walking stick. I know so much about you. I felt that. How long will it last? Yes. Hand me that hyperspanner. There, that should at least get the short range transmitters operational. Now, if we can get the signal amplifiers online. Well, I guess you haven't learned everything about me, have you. You're the ones who saved my life. I was so resistant to being linked. Now I'm almost sorry it's over. Last night when we were still connected, I realised what it is you really want from us. It's more than just supplies and security upgrades. It's a pretty radical concept. Why don't you tell her about it yourself? [Briefing room] I know it sounds extreme, Captain, but I think you should hear her out. What they're asking us to do is reactivate that ship's neuroelectric generator and redirect it toward the planet. If you're asking me whether or not she's sincere, I have to say yes. That's an understatement. I heard their thoughts, felt their feelings, saw through their eyes. No. I really care about what happens to these people, so in my heart I'd like to do everything we can to help them. But if I were sitting in your chair, I'd have to take other considerations into account. I'll let Riley know. [Settlement] (Other crew are also on the planet.) I'm afraid her decision was final. What about the raiders? How long do you think you can hold out against them? Come with us. We could replicate some Texas Barbeque. I'm sure it won't compare to your mothers, but I think I've never understood anyone better in my life. You're on. Did you say something? Are you getting a comm. transmission? It must have been my imagination. I'm fine. Don't do that. (Chakotay points a phaser at Torres.) I don't know what to say except I'm sorry. Maybe so. But somehow that doesn't make me feel any better. I helped them repair the communications array, and I told you they were sincere. But I couldn't have been more wrong about them, could I? But they didn't hesitate to impose their collective will on me when it served their interests, did they? I wonder how long their ideals will last in the face of that kind of power. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

That asteroid should have been vaporised. What happened? Location? Bridge to Engineering. B'Elanna, I want you to beam aboard a sample of the debris from that last asteroid. Let's find out why it wasn't vaporised. Hail them. Notify Lieutenant Paris and the others. We may have a team down. Go ahead. [Engineering] I'll be right there. Ambassador? [Shuttlecraft] (The shuttle has landed. There is knocking on the hull. Tuvok opens the rear door.) B'Elanna, give me a hand with this. (They pull the rock apart to reveal technology inside.) Ambassador, I have a feeling these asteroids aren't striking your planet by chance. [Mag-lev carriage] They remodulated their shields to fool our sensors. We're being hailed. They'll be here in under ten minutes, Captain. The ship is within range. They're charging weapons. No effect. We can't penetrate their shields. [Mag-lev carriage] They're remodulating their shields. They're retreating, Captain.
Chakotay here, Captain. [Mountain path] JANEWAY
Let's mark the coordinates of that trinary star. It'll be a good reference point for this sector. Not that I remember. Why? What? Warp engines are down. A plasma conduit just blew in Engineering. Propulsion systems are down. They're reporting casualties. How could you know that? They'll intercept in thirty six minutes. I doubt it. Engineering's still working on repairs. We could manage warp three at best. We're coming up on that star system. We'll pass it if we stay at warp. They'll enter weapons range in a few seconds. (On the viewscreen is the planet from Kim's dream.) Is it Nasari? Aye, Captain. What's your next trick, Harry. Pull a shuttlecraft out of a hat? Can we get through the grid? I guess we're not welcome anymore. [Taresia] (The room is darkened. Women enter bearing staffs. Eliann lights candles.) We've been able to poke some holes in the tachyon grid but they're too small to squeeze Voyager through. I doubt it. And even if one could, there's another problem. A Taresian ship is patrolling the other side of the grid. [Doctor's office] I thought you'd confirmed that he has Taresian DNA. Their whole story about embryo implantation was a lie. He's human. Wouldn't the biofilters pick up the virus and eliminate it? Our away mission to that planet where we found the vorillium. Harry was with us, and he was separated from the group for a while. Don't forget that welcoming committee on the planet. It sounds as if they're giving him every incentive to want to stay on Taresia. We've been lucky to have you, Harry. If we hit the grid here, we'll have a few seconds before the patrol ship can move in to intercept us. Then I'll have to be quick. I'm not picking up Harry's comm. signal. Initiating level one bioscans of the surface. We've got him. Welcome back. We could use your strategic intuition about now.
Captain's log, stardate 55836.2. Kes has remained in temporal sync with us for two days now, but since we don't know when she may jump again, we can't afford to rest until we've found some way to help her. [Medical laboratory]
Debris? Something ripped it apart, and from the energy decay readings I'd say it was no more than an hour ago. I've got it too. It's like a wake, leading away from the debris field. I can't tell. I see it too. A subspace disruption. Brace for impact! I'm not afraid to say it. I've never seen anything like that before. I'm looking at the telemetry we've collected. It was an astral eddy that seems to have formed at the confluence of space and subspace. If we could harness some of that energy, we could go off replicator rations for a while. Be ready to move away quickly if it starts moving towards us. What about the plasma? Is there anyway we can transfer some of it to Voyager? Where's the probe? We've got another particle wake. Since we can't get plasma directly from the eddies, maybe we can collect some from their wakes. Right. [Shuttlecraft Cochrane] Yes, ma'am. [Sickbay]
We've completed long range scans. If we maintain our present course we'll enter a region of heavy tetryon radiation within two days. A three month detour. Source? Localise them. Seal off the deck. Go ahead. [Corridor] JANEWAY Acknowledged. [Mess hall] Neelix, get down! (Neelix duck and Chakotay fires. The two Voth become visible. Veer fires a dart into Chakotay's shoulder, who collapses. Tuvok stuns Veer. Gegen goes to Chakotay and beams out with him.) [Sickbay] Chakotay to Voyager. What do you want from me? Why did you invade our ship? Do you always harpoon the local wildlife? So you took me instead. That's right. Earth. Who are you? Look, drop the forcefield and tell me what's going on. Then maybe we can make first contact in a civilized way. For what it's worth I'm a scientist, too. Maybe I can help you find whatever it is you're looking for. I won't bite. Thanks. My name's Chakotay. All right, Gegen, let's talk about Earth. [Sickbay] If a saurian species had developed a language and technology, you'd think they would have left something behind. But, what if it evolved on am isolated continent? Earth has been devastated by countless natural disasters over the course of it's history. Asteroids, volcanoes, earthquakes. All evidence of your race could be at the bottom of the ocean or under kilometres of rock. And ended up here, in the Delta Quadrant. Next time you might try a simple hello first. I hope I've made a good impression. Well I suggest we get back to Voyager. Your friend Veer is probably sick of the mammalian food by now. Why not? Tell them we'll be late. What are you going to do? That might be difficult with the evidence standing right beside you. They've taken my ship. It sounds to me like we're all on trial here. If I may speak? Voyager's database contains a complete fossil record of my planet. Your genetic markers appear not only in humans but in hundreds of species throughout our history. That's a lot of random convergence. If you'd take a look at the data Gegen! It's you who are mistaken, Minister. You accuse Gegen of having his objectivity clouded by wishful thinking, but aren't you guilty of the same charge? I understand, but in a way your beliefs are. How you think about yourselves, your place in the universe, that is on trial. And this isn't the first time. I've had the opportunity over the last few days to learn something about your culture, your great accomplishments. Consider the breakthrough into Transwarp, an incredible achievement, and yet, your ancient Doctrine predicted terrible disasters if it were even attempted. That held your race back for millennia, until someone took a chance and challenged that prediction. They succeeded, and your society entered a new chapter of exploration, and your Doctrine was changed accordingly. I know from the history of my own planet that change is difficult. New ideas are often greeted with scepticism, even fear. But sometimes those ideas are accepted, and when they are progress is made. Eyes are opened. I see something very different, Minister. An ancient race of Saurians, probably the first intelligent life on Earth, surrounded by some of the most terrifying creatures that ever lived. And yet they thrived, developed language and culture and technology. And when the planet was threatened with disaster, they boldly launched themselves into space, crossed what must have seemed like unimaginable distances, facing the unknown every day. But somehow they stayed together, kept going, with the same courage that had served them before, until they reached this quadrant, where they laid the foundation of what has become the great Voth culture. Deny that past, and you deny the struggle and achievements of your ancestors. Deny your origins on Earth, and you deny your true heritage. I'm sorry. You were courageous, just as the Voth have always been from the first time they left Earth. There's something else I hope you never forget. (He gives Gegen a small globe of Earth.) Some day. Eyes open. Chakotay to Voyager. Energise. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

In the last three hours we've lost twenty two of our people. According to the Nyrians, they've all showed up on their colony as though we're switching places. Any idea what might be causing these transfers? In all fairness, Captain, they haven't been threatening in any way. They seem as puzzled by all this as we are. Cargo Bay two is almost full. We'll have to start converting the shuttle bays. I'll have to reassign more crewmembers to security. Our ranks are getting a little thin. Then how do we get it unsnagged? I think he's in Cargo Bay two now. Chakotay to Neelix. The Captain's gone. We need you to find a Nyrian scientist called Rislan and get him to Engineering as soon as you can. Do what you have to do to get some answers, B'Elanna. [Cargo Bay two] I can't spare anyone for repairs. You'll have to make do. How do you like your first day as Chief of Security, Ensign? Who says there's no room for advancement on this ship. How many people does that leave us? More than one hundred Nyrians. I want access to all systems restricted to authorised voice prints only. Seal off any part of the ship that we're not using and place security forcefields around sensitive areas. Warp core, armoury, torpedo bays. And let's hope I'm just being paranoid. [Engineering] What, all thirteen of them? What about the Nyrian scientist he was watching? Find him. That's a priority. To have a talk with the Nyrians. [Cargo Bay two] (The cargo bay is empty of life.) Chakotay to all hands. Security alert. The Nyrians may be trying to take control of the ship. Everyone, get to the bridge or main Engineering and secure them against possible intruders. [Jefferies tube] They're everywhere. They're even decrypting our access codes. The Nyrians obviously prepared for this before they got here. They must have tapped into our computer somehow, gotten enough information to plan this mission down to the letter. (Chakotay suddenly realises he is talking to himself.) Larsen? Chakotay to anybody who's left. Please respond. Anybody else? The two of us aren't going to win this, so we might as well make life as difficult for the Nyrians as we can. Sabotage everything you can get your hands on. Good luck. [Bridge] Let's hope so. Chakotay to Gennaro. They're trying to delete the Doctor's programme. Are you anywhere near Sickbay? Gennaro? Computer, how long ago did Crewman Gennaro leave the ship? Activate Emergency Medical Holographic programme. Doctor, over here. You're program's going to be deleted unless I can download you into the mobile emitter before I disappear, which should be any second now. (The Nyrians start to force open the door. The EMH hypos the first one, blocking the door.) Got it! (The EMH vanishes. Chakotay palms the mobile emitter as the other Nyrians enter.) All right. I know when to quit. [Habitat] Is this the way you operate, gradually changing places with the crew of a ship? What happens if we try to leave this little paradise? It's still a prison. A perfectly isolated area. Doesn't that seem a bit convenient? You're assuming the first one will work. I've got to give you credit, Tuvok, working on the fly with nothing but random parts, with no guide to follow. I never thought Vulcans had much of a knack for improvising. You could say that. This reminds me of those survival classes they put us through at the Academy. Surprise tactical simulations, getting dropped off in the woods with no chance to prepare. They certainly taught you to live by your wits. I guess so.
Where are you headed? Mind if I walk with you? So, how's it going? Tuvok still giving you a hard time? I don't know about you, but when I think about spending seventy years on the same ship with that guy, it gives me a headache. I get the impression a lot of the crew agrees with me. Maquis and Starfleet. [Turbolift]  Bridge. So, what do you think? About what I've been saying. That a lot of the crew aren't too happy with our Chief of Security. And for that matter, I don't think Captain Janeway's winning any popularity contests either. Don't you agree? Let's just say I'm interested in your opinion. You're a good officer. I like you. And I wouldn't want to see you get hurt. There're going to be some changes around here. All of the Maquis are in line, and about twenty five of the Starfleet crew are with us. And when the shooting starts, I'm going to need to know which side you're on. [Bridge] There's a first time for everything, I guess. Don't worry, Captain, I'll keep your ship safe and sound. Captain, I've been thinking. Are you sure you don't want to take Lieutenant Tuvok with you, just in case the Rukani turn out to be less friendly than they seem? Lieutenant, I want you to keep close tabs on the Captain's shuttle. Let's make sure she doesn't run into any trouble. Ensign, let's shut down those transporters and start that diagnostic we've been putting off. Have you finished upgrading the internal sensors, Ensign? (Torres is at Mission Ops 2.) I hope so. (Two security men enter by the door next to Tuvok's station. Chakotay takes a PADD from one of them.) Wait here. No, it's just tomorrow's duty roster. Thank you, Tuvok. Chakotay to all hands. Let's do it. You're wasting your time, Harry. All my teams have taken control of Security, Engineering and all key systems. That's going to be a little difficult. All your off-duty Starfleet friends have been locked down in quarters. (Kim is about to shoot Chakotay, but Ensign Torres gets him first.) I guess you've made your choice. Go ahead. Carlson, O'Donnell, get these people to the brig. Ayala, take the conn and move us out of com range of Janeway's shuttle. You're with me. [Turbolift]  Deck two. Thanks for watching my back in there. Are you okay? He's only stunned. We're not going to kill anybody today, unless it's absolutely necessary. Just stay close. [Corridor]  Stay low. We'll just have to shoot our way past them. Ready? (They shoot down the guards, one is taken out by a Bajoran woman with a phaser rifle.) Thanks for the help. Everybody, drop your weapons. We're still going to need a cook. Chakotay to Engineering. What's your status? Transporter rooms one and two, status. Shuttlebay, status. I'll take care of the prisoners here. You two get some help and start rounding up the personnel that are still locked down in quarters. Bring them to Cargo Bay one. Just like old times. [Corridor] Now is not the time, Seska. Take a good look around you. You're under armed guard. You may also notice that your senior officers aren't here. They're in the brig. They'll be put off the ship at the first habitable planet we come to. All except Janeway and Paris, who will arrive at their rendezvous coordinates to find that Voyager's not there. In short, I've taken control of the ship. I don't blame any of you for the mistakes of your leaders, so I'm giving you a choice. You can be put off the ship with your superiors or you can do what Neelix and some of your other crew members have already done and join me. If you do, you'll be part of a crew that's going to do whatever it takes to get us home as fast as possible. Under my command, we won't let almighty Federation principles get in the way of opportunities the way Janeway did when she destroyed the array that could have gotten us home. And we won't be wasting precious time stopping to investigate every insignificant anomaly that we come across. What we will do is use any means necessary to acquire technology that can shorten our journey. To hell with Starfleet regulations. You have fifteen minutes to make up your minds. It's been accessed forty seven times by thirty three different crew members. Anybody else? Besides, Tuvok, if the crew doesn't get an ending, you may have a real mutiny on your hands. I don't care what kind of story it is, as long as I'm not the bad guy this time.
It's Kes. The Doctor believes that the aliens are accessing her memory. I've ordered long range scans for bioships. Nothing so far. Chakotay out.
Ship's status report. We've got two teams on the hull, stripping off the Borg armour. They're working around the clock but it's still slow going. Torres is having problems cleaning out the plasma relays. It's disrupting the antimatter reaction. Until she's got it fixed we're stuck at impulse. She's requesting all personnel with a level three engineering rating or higher to lend a hand. Long range sensors are picking up residual transwarp signatures, Borg vessels. They passed by probably three days ago. Having half our propulsion system overrun by Borg implants doesn't make repairs any easier. That might be true if she were willing, but she's not in the most cooperative mood. Our Borg? For all we know, Annika and her parents were the first humans the Borg ever assimilated. So she was raised by the Borg. It's the only life she ever really knew. If you were thinking of bringing her into the fold, that might not be possible. She's bypassed our security protocols. It's too late. [Kes' quarters] Increase the structural integrity field on deck two. Chakotay here. Captain? Captain, we can't get a lock. [Corridor] What's happening? Emergency containment fields. Acknowledged. (The shuttlecraft flies out of the bay and goes up.) Systems coming back online.
