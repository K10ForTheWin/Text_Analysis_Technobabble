We don't know. They were incinerated in the methane explosion, and the farmer's description was vague at best. The Klingons made it very clear they want us to expedite this. You will be apprised of all pertinent information. When he was nearly killed by your "farmer." Sarcasm aside, Captain, the last thing your people need is to make an enemy of the Klingon Empire. Klaang's culture finds honour in death. If they saw him like this he'd be disgraced. The Klingons have demanded that we return Klaang immediately. This is no time to be imposing your ethical beliefs. (protesting) Admiral. Listen to me. You're making a mistake!
We were observing a dangerous and aggressive neighbour. The Andorians wouldn't have found the station if your people hadn't interfered. They've been in space for six months and they've already destabilised an entire sector. We warned you something like this would happen. He's too impulsive. Captain Gardner would have made a far more suitable commanding officer. There was a time when your people sought our guidance. I regret that time has passed. I've been recalled to Vulcan for consultation. In the meantime, our joint fleet operations have been suspended.
They're three days overdue. You also told me Starfleet had ordered him to deliver Sub-Commander T'Pol and his medical officer to the Vulcan ship D'kyr. They're three days overdue. Captain Archer's negligence caused the death of three thousand colonists. Your superiors instructed them to return to Earth. Their mission is over. They haven't followed those instructions. The D'kyr said they were joined by a number of other vessels. They're no longer within sensor range. They were at too great a distance to identify. Enterprise has ignored our hails and defied Starfleet's orders. I have no choice but to send the D'kyr in pursuit. No, he doesn't, but Sub-Commander T'Pol does, and since she would never comply with his present actions I have to conclude that she's being held against her will. Does he really? (The Vulcan group leave.) [Helix]
Thank you, Captain. This is Sub-commander Muroc. (sitting) If you don't mind, Captain, I have a question of my own. Why would an officer of the Andorian Imperial Guard personally request your involvement? I'm involved in extremely difficult and dangerous negotiations. I don't consider your presence here an asset. Six days ago, an Andorian regimental commander named Shran landed a force on Paan Mokar and occupied the settlement. Naturally, we attempted to enforce the Treaty of 2097. Shran has agreed to discuss terms for their safe return, but only if you act as mediator. For some reason, he finds you trustworthy. Yes, Captain, I'm asking for your help. Forgive my candor, but that's hardly reassuring. The last time you dealt with the Andorians, a Vulcan intelligence site was compromised and a priceless monastery destroyed. Sub-commander Muroc will accompany you to represent our interests. And in exchange, you'll deliver me into their hands? I'm sure the Andorians were impressed with your negotiating skills. If I agree to a meeting, it's simply legitimises their position. They probably intend to re-supply their troops on the surface. We won't allow that. That will be their decision. You don't understand the complexities of this situation. I didn't request your help, Captain, and I don't feel obliged to accept it. Didn't you hear the Captain? The ball is in our court. (Soval goes down the steps with T'Pol while Muroc stalks out.) Thank you for the reassurance. Now if you don't mind, I'll need a few moments of silence to prepare myself. I suggest we cancel the negotiations and return to your ship. Now you see who you're dealing with, Captain? The southeast quadrant, near the old spaceport. I told you I negotiated the last accord. I also served here. As an intelligence officer, a long time ago. Our current deployment has a base of operations that way, about two and a half kilometres. Circumstances have altered our plans. Shran just tried to kill us. I suppose you think our troops are responsible for this? Are you that naive? Shran is using you. It's been almost a hundred years. This is the old residential quarter. According to our latest intelligence, the Andorians control the settlement west of here. Not quite the warm welcome you expected, Captain? We should try to make contact with them. What do you recommend? Wandering through these ruins until we find an Andorian soldier, and trust he's been informed not to shoot us on sight? What is their fixation with our ears? Do you realise you've picked up a slight human accent? You were one of the most promising members of my staff, T'Pol. If you'd stayed in San Francisco, you'd be the Assistant Counsel by now. You might even have a diplomatic posting of your own. Then why have you remained on Enterprise? Captain Archer's record is evidence of that, but there are others who can assist them. Gratification is an emotional indulgence. You disagreed with our recommendation that Archer's mission be cancelled after the tragedy at Paraaga Two. Why? You believed you knew better than the High Command? That sounds a great deal like another emotion, arrogance. Perhaps it's time for you to consider another assignment. What do you expect me to do with this? I haven't fired a weapon in fifty years. Commander, it seems you're willing to resolve this situation through peaceful means. Do all your officers feel the same? I consider any negotiation that averts war to be a success. (Shran stands and uncorks a purple bottle.) Vulcans don't drink. But this occasion merits an exception. (All stand and toast.) And to the successful continuation of these talks on Andoria. Captain, your presence here has not been overly meddlesome. (Soval leaves.)
Our Science Directorate has determined that time travel is impossible. Do you know where these co-ordinates he gave you are? They're inside the Delphic Expanse. A region of space nearly two thousand light years across. Vulcan ships have entered it, but only a few have returned. There has been reports of fierce and dangerous species, unexplained anomalies. In some regions, even the laws of physics don't apply. Twenty years ago, a Klingon vessel emerged from the Expanse. Every crewmen on board has been anatomically inverted, their bodies splayed open, and they were still alive. You'd be more than foolish to pursue this course of action. This is typical of your impulsiveness. You'd be putting your crew's lives at stake when you have no evidence that anything you were told were true. What exactly are you trying to show us, Captain? You said he told you this faction from the future could only communicate through time, so how do you suggest they get this component to the Xindi? A lack of another explanation doesn't make your assumption correct. Are you suggesting this is a Xindi? It's important for you to see what you'll be facing. The Vaankara was in the Delphic Expanse for less then two days when we received a distress call. This transmission arrived six hours later. (Pictures on screen of Vulcans screaming, fighting and killing each I'm suggesting you reconsider this mission. I need to speak with you, T'Pol. [Outside Fleet Operations Center] You've spent far to much time with humans. It would be best if you returned home for a while. You were there to provide logic to a crew of humans who insisted on leaving before they were ready, but logic can't help them inside the Delphic Expanse. The High Command was quite specific. You're to return to Vulcan. This is not the matter of choice. Defying the High Command would mean immediate dismissal. You know that. [Corridor]
(monitor scenes of Vulcans attacking each other) We received a distress call. Every crewman had been anatomically inverted. Their bodies splayed open, and they were still alive.
That uniform doesn’t suit you, Captain. I want you to return with me to Vulcan. It’s not an order, it’s a request for your own safety. Two weeks ago, the High Command received a distress call from the Earth convoy in the Mutara system. By the time our ships reached them, they found nothing but a field of debris. The weapon signatures were Xindi. Even if your ships do manage to reach Ceti Alpha, it’s most likely you’ll find an armada waiting for you. It was a mistake ordering you to leave Enterprise. It forced you to make an impulsive decision. If you return with me now, the High Command is prepared to reinstate your rank. Them or him? There are specialists on Vulcan that can help Archer. If you return to Vulcan. You owe the humans nothing. They chose to leave Earth before they were ready. If they’d accepted our counsel, this tragedy would have been avoided. How? Your emotional attachment to Archer is clouding your logic. We’ll be within range for another thirty hours, should you reconsider. [Archer's quarters]
According to your log, the entire crew of the Seleya was killed when you triggered a reactor breach. As far as I can determine, you didn't try to save a single Vulcan crewman. Is that your medical opinion, Captain? Our specialists have examined the data you sent back. It's far from certain that the neurological damage was irreversible. T'Pol was exposed to the trellium. She recovered. There's no need to get emotional, Captain. You spent several hours in the ship's auxiliary control room. In that time, did you try to access the internal sensors, or download the computer database? So in effect, we don't know what really happened aboard the Seleya. Because of this oversight, we'll never have a complete picture of the events that led to the ship's destruction. No one is accusing you of anything, Captain. I beg your pardon? Yes, you were. Captain. Your actions, while being morally questionable, were necessary. I opposed your appointment as captain of Enterprise, but it's obvious now that I was wrong. T'Pol has told me that the Expanse would have someday encompassed hundreds of systems, including Vulcan. You've done a great service for both our worlds. (He holds out his hand.) Thank you. (They shake.) [T'Pol's family home - guest room]
Admiral, the High Command will tell you its decision at the proper time.
The answers you need are on Vulcan, and however far you have to take this investigation, you have my support.  V'Las was involved with the attack on your embassy. He's responsible for blaming it on the Syrrannites. [Vulcan High Command]
The High Command is planning to attack Andoria.
(with goatee beard) Hull breach on B deck. Emergency bulkheads are engaged. Hull plating's at thirty two percent. Admiral, there's another vessel approaching. No. [Bridge] (Defiant blows the rebels to pieces.) Enter. (T'Pol enters, and raises her hand in the traditional Vulcan greeting.) It's not wise to make that gesture, even behind closed doors. It is agreeable to see you again. The implications are intriguing. This alternate universe is very different from ours. I'm not certain a Federation could ever exist here. That was many years ago. How? Data will be of little value. Archer still controls that ship. What? I'm too old to become a revolutionary. You're the only non-Terran on the Defiant. Any of us would arouse suspicion. Are you loyal to the Empire or not? If Archer fails, his crew will have to answer for his crimes. Don't forget the females. You'll be able to choose as many concubines as you'd like. Shut down the turbolifts. (to an Orion woman) Secure the Bridge. [Briefing room] You need to remove the duotronic module. [USS Defiant] You have to disengage the flow regulators before you remove the relays [USS Defiant] Someone's trying to override the Bridge lockouts. Doctor, you must hurry! [USS Defiant - Bridge] Close to ten thousand metres. Target their primary hull. (A barrage of torpedoes set off explosions.) [USS Defiant] Continue firing. [USS Defiant] (Tucker knocks out Phlox and puts the flow regulators back.) [Bridge] (Archer has his head down as if he's crying.) Soval to Phlox. [USS Defiant] Get us out of their weapons range! Divert all power to hull plating! [Bridge]
Spontaneous demonstrations have already begun around the Vulcan compound. It's obvious Paxton's ultimatum is part of a co-ordinated plan. The deadline aside, the fact that Paxton has the support of so many of your people is almost as troubling.
