I heard this platform's been approved for bio-transport.
They're on an intercept course.
Yes, sir. Minshara-class? Aye sir. [Planet surface] (The pod lands in a meadow, and Porthos is first out to sniff at a tree.) It's beautiful all right, but I couldn't call a place home unless it came with a pair of warp nacelles. We would? Exactly. The pod had been drifting in space for sixty three years. Bioscans showed one lifesign inside the pod. Human. The assistant engineer, George Webb, a friend of my uncle's, was assigned to open it. Took him over an hour to cut through the hull. He said the metal felt strange, cold to the touch. He could hear a tapping noise coming from inside, but when he finally got it open the pod was empty. No body, nothing. A few days later, Webb started acting strange, getting into fights with the crew, muttering to himself in some sort of alien language. Then one day he locked himself in Engineering and overloaded the impulse reactors. He almost destroyed the ship. Then he sealed himself in a life pod and ejected it. The reactors were too badly damaged. Some people say it was an alien life form that got into him, others think it was the ghost of a dead crewman. I never knew what to believe, but Webb is still out there, drifting. When the subspace noise is real low, some comm. officers say they can still hear the echo of his distress call. Beep, Beep. (All laugh.) Are you sure? Now you know. Try flying through an ion storm at warp two. [Tent two] What is it? What for? Are we allowed to squash alien life forms? You wanna shoot a bug? Not me, sir. I'll go. Trip? Hello? [Cavern] There's someone else out there. (hands over sole food pack) Near the campsite. It's no story. I'm telling you, I saw three people. It was too dark. There could be something wrong with your scanner. They looked pretty real to me. Ethan! That could explain why they're not showing up on our scanners. (In the cavern, Cutler hears voices and goes deeper into the tunnels to investigate. Outside, the men nearly step off a cliff in the dark.) Sir. I hate to add to our problems, but we're running low on water. Sir? You were the one who found these caves, and it was your idea to stay overnight. Commander! There! (Tucker fires his phase pistol.) I'm trying, sir. No. (So she neck-pinches him and injects him anyway, before finally injecting herself. The sun has risen by the time Tucker wakes up and accepts a drink of water from her.) I was hoping it was all just a bad dream. Ow, I must have twisted up my neck. How's Novakovich? Do we know?
Aye, sir. We've got a seal. It's too bad the ship-to-ship sensors are down. Would have been nice to get a look at them. (handing up case as Tucker climbs into theÂ tube between the airlocks) Here you go. I don't know. We are kind of busy. Have fun. (The shuttlepod undocks, leaving the slightly organic looking ship.) [Decompression chamber] Before you know it, he'll have that engine room running like a well-oiled machine. What were the Xyrillians like? Aye, sir. [Mess hall] Looks like their signature. Should I lay in a new course, Captain?
Two hundred thousand kilometres. I don't get it. If they're human, why were they shooting at us? [Turbolift] Ever heard of Judge Crater?
There what is? Not a lot of room on that landing platform. Maybe they're just some other visitors. You heard what he said. If we try to send more people.
Archer's comet. Aye sir. Aye, sir. (In her quarters, T'Pol stares at characters on a computer screen.) [Mess hall] (Tucker selects a dish from the cabinet, then orders his drink from the dispenser.) The comet's certainly big enough to land on. We could take a shuttlepod. Has anyone? I've only seen snow twice in my life. You mean plant a flag? Snowball fight. Lieutenant. What do you think? (He's built a snowman.) The ears are a nice touch. We should get out more often. Impressive. I'll get the drill. [Captain's mess] I'm okay. Ah! My knee. I'm all right. At least take the core sample. We shouldn't go back to the ship empty-handed. (A white dawn is looming below the horizon.) It might be faster without the suits. I hope I never see snow again. (They climb aboard the shuttlepod.) [Shuttlepod] (Whilst trying to lift off, alarms bleeping, the pod falls through the weakened surface ice.) We should have never ignited the thrusters. They've got us.
There's a ship approaching. We've lost lateral thrusters. I can't shake them.
Stubborn stupidity. Maybe not. But if you don't let your hostage go [Bridge] No maybes. (Ryan hauls the Nausicaan to his feet.)
Hold the door. Where were you last night? Lieutenant. Did you get to meet them? There's a vessel approaching no bigger than a shuttlepod. It's Suliban. [Launch Bay]
Maybe they checked us out and decided we weren't very interesting. I had to reverse engines to keep from banging into them. They've gone to warp, sir. So how's your secret mission coming? Sir, we could try to contact the Vulcan High Command. They're only two days away at warp six. I'm sure they'd give us a hand. Should I try evasive manoeuvres? Ten thousand metres, nine. Five thousand metres. One thousand metres. Gladly, sir. [Armoury]
Nothing I can't avoid, sir.
It might be easier to locate the shuttlepod. At least it sounds like they're still alive. Here we go.
Mayweather. Yes, sir. Sir, the alien ship sunk another two thousand metres. It's below the shuttle's safety limits.
Aye, sir. [Inspection pod] (Smaller and rounder than a shuttlepod, with no wings for atmosphere flight.)
It's big. Over eight billion kilometres in diameter. According to sensors.
It's a real honour, sir. Seeing those Starfleet captains every day gave us something to aspire to. Aye, sir. (Tucker takes the photo.) Shouldn't the surface be frozen solid?
Are we sure that's a good idea? We don't know what happened to the crew. That ship could be a tomb. You really think we should be picking through it for spare parts, sir? Yes, sir. I was just wondering. If that trader left in such a hurry, why'd he bother to close the hatch behind him? [Alien Engineering] (T'Pol and Tucker examine equipment, then she hears a noise from behind one of the lozenge-shaped doors.) What do you think that trader really saw down here, sir? That makes sense, except scavengers would've stripped this ship to the keel. Would make a good one, sir. (Archer shines a light on a console with two large discs with handles on them.) Yes, sir. There's no power but the data modules look intact. Didn't you send out a distress call? Well, we can't just leave you here. It's not big enough to feed all the people on that ship, sir. Not by a long shot. It's in shuttlepod one. Aye, sir. [Engineering] (Walking along the upper gantry) Won't they pick us up on sensors? Aye, sir. (Archer and Reed turn right. Further on, Reed is shot in the back, Archer drags him behind a container but his return fire goes straight through their attacker. They retreat.) [Alien computer core]
Captain? Sir? (No response, so Travis gets to his feet wearily and looks around. The door is unlocked, so he opens it to see a pair of Suliban walking by. When the coast is clear, he goes exploring. Later -) I saw at least thirty. This place is pretty big. There could be more. I didn't exactly have time to get a good look. (Archer finally gets to his feet.) There's a wall about five metres high. It's looks like it surrounds this entire building. I see something that might be a guard tower but I can't be sure. No, sir. (He gets down.) And you are? Does everyone that violates your territory get thrown into a place like this? If you're worried we're Suliban, trust me, we're not. Three days? They call this a proper meal? I should save it for Commander Tucker. It'd make a good valve sealant. (pouring water) This thing doesn't hold much. I've had plenty, thank you. It was very good. What about the government on the Suliban homeworld? Don't they have something to say about this? Writing a letter? Could be valuable someday. People will want to know what happened here. Then why are you writing it? That's not true. [Cell] (While Travis sleeps, Archer is studying a plan of the centre when a communicator materialises on the floor beside him.) Would you rather spend the rest of your life in prison? Sorry, Captain. What do you care. You might try isolation. Still think we're working with the Tandarans? You know, we could have left this place a long time ago if we hadn't decided to help you. Why? Because we're not Suliban? Because we look a little too much like Tandarans? I'll admit, when I first came here it wasn't easy to see past my preconceptions about the Suliban, but I did. Why can't you? [Bridge] Yes? Who are you? Malcolm? Long story. How'd you get down here? Are you sure you weren't detected? They're in place. Are you up for this? (Danik nods, then the siren sounds.) Good luck. Major, do you have a second? I don't mean to cause any trouble, but I was wondering if it might be possible to get some better food. No offence, but the meals here are pretty awful. I'll try, but I'm not sure I can hold down another bowl of that what do you call it? It tastes like sawdust. Is that what they make you eat? Because if it is, I'd think about going on a hunger strike. I don't know how you. I'll go. Come on. [Isolation cell] Captain, think they'll make it?
I think I found them.
I've never done it, but if there was ever a time to learn. 'Your guides are genetically enhanced to breathe underwater.' And they're all female. (Hoshi rolls her eyes, Reed suddenly gets interested.) How about you, Lieutenant? A small craft's approaching, sir. They're closing, fast. Aye, sir. How's the ocean? Aye, sir. Warp four point eight. Warp four point nine. (The ship shakes a bit.) At this speed, a little over two hours, but I don't think we can hold it that long. They're increasing speed. Warp four point nine five. Four point nine three, nine five. [Engineering] Four point nine nine. Warp five. (Big vibrations start.) They're right on top of us. We're dropping to impulse.
Well, we can't just leave them down there. What about the transporter?
I feel terrible.
Did you see that? I'm coming around. Bring the grappler online. (Hoshi goes to What is it? Traces of borocarbons. After a year on Enterprise, the thought of a cargo ship is pretty unappealing. Or maybe infamous. From what Commander Tucker tells me, people back home think that we're doing nothing out here but getting in trouble. The docked ship is moving away.
They're adjacent to the air ducts. She's pretty small.
Aye, sir. Some kind of cloaked ship? I believe so. Sir, they're hailing us. (T'Pol goes to Hoshi's station and soon an alien language comes through the speakers.) They're charging weapons. (A shot is fired.) TRAVIS: They missed our starboard nacelle by less than twenty metres. The orbits of those mines are pretty erratic, sir. It's going to be tricky. Aye, sir. (A joystick comes out for him to steer with.) I see it. (He makes a slow but sharp turn.) [Hull] (The mine reacts to the manoeuvre.) Thank you, sir, but I'd prefer to stay at my post. Sub-commander. (T'Pol comes forward to the Captain's chair.) No response. (He is now at Reed's station.) I see them. Bearing two one three mark four. Closing in. A hundred metres more. Fifty. I've got them. Sealing Launch bay doors.
Aye, sir.(They arrive at the repair station.) Sir. (One of the two docking bays opens and expands to receive the starship.) Mayweather. I thought that section was off-limits, sir. Aye, sir. [Station ventilation shaft] (The two explorers are crawling on hands and knees.) Much better, sir. Thank you. The doctor told me what happened. I'm not sure I understand. Why would it do that? What about all those other people? Sounds good, sir.(In the darkness of space, amongst a load of debris, a welding arm is at work.) <Back to the episode listing Star Trek Â® is copyright of CBS Studios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are for educational and entertainment purposes only.
I'm reading twelve biosigns, all Klingon. [Settlement] Aye, sir. [Settlement] (Six Klingons beam down from a tatty looking vessel.) It's not you that I'm worried about. (He swings it and she dodges either side then rolls away.)
Pernaia Prime. Yes, sir. Where exactly will we be going? Don't move. (T'Pol gives Archer the handcuffs and he puts them on Menos.) Aye, sir. [Outside the Tavern] He kicked over the table! Aye, sir. Captain. There's something funny up here, sir. Think you could take a look? (Archer goes through to the cockpit.) After I got the board running, I brought life support up to level three. As soon as I got more light in here, I noticed some condensation on this sub-panel. Our scanner showed everything powered down. Aye, sir. (Menos kneels down.) I think I know why he was so nervous about us firing at him while he was over here. Look at this.
Guard towers, gun emplacements, it's not a hotel. Aye, sir. (They leave.) Maybe this panel isn't the cloaking device. This would be a lot easier if there was a button marked cloak. Are you all right? Maybe a little more than that. (Tucker lifts his right arm to see most of it has disappeared.)  [Sickbay] Any change? Having a cloaked hand could have its advantages. Be useful in a poker match. It might be helpful on movie night, if you bring a date. In case you want to steal some popcorn. Is it working? What was that? Primary and backups. We did. It'd be a lot easier if they stop firing at us. The shuttlepod's right where you left it, sir. We'll be there in two minutes. (Archer starts frantically searching his pockets.)
Doctor? (Phlox is staring intently at the body scanner monitor.)
But that's what you said, though. So, what was it like? You can't go on a survival overnight without hearing a story about someone seeing Ramsey's molecules rematerialising on a foggy night. Death Valley, California. Middle of July, naturally. You? You don't take me anywhere. (All the men get up and leave.) [OC]: Aye, Captain.
He hasn't gotten far at warp two, sir. Captain. (A cloud of something from the freighter covers the viewscreen.) He's moving off. Our warp drive won't engage. He's moving out of sensor range. I've lost him. [Retellian cargo hold] (Tucker awakes with a sore head only to be hit again by the woman.)
Maybe we should open a window. And don't forget Porthos, and all the Doctor's animals. Ran into a Class three once. Had to take shelter in the ship's core. We were down there for six weeks. Any idea about a latrine? Not much room for a Captain's chair. We only got worried when the generators went down. We lost the grav-plating, life support. I'll never forget that look in my father's eyes. He knew we were in trouble. [Corridor] (Phlox and Archer escort the three aliens out of the Decon chamber.) Spatial turbulence. Aft stabilisers aren't engaging. Grav-shear's dropping. (Porthos re-emerges.) TRAVIS: That should be the worst of it, sir, at least for now. [Catwalk] (Archer is walking through, during jolts, and picks up a small PADD.) ARCHER Yours? Looks like you're almost finished. (The crewwoman takes back her crossword puzzle.) We've got a cluster of plasma eddies about eighty thousand kilometres ahead. I should be able to steer clear of them. Aye, Captain. Thank you, sir. Good night. Broccoli? Call. Anyone know what they're showing tonight? I think something's burning. (Smoke is coming from the alien's area. Trip dashes over and pulls open the blanket curtain to discover them cooking over a stove.) It'll take a minute, sir. We're too close to the eddy. We've got to veer off. We've got no choice.
Malcolm? Yes, sir.
They said it was an honour. It looked easy enough. They've got these fargans. They're kind of like cows with humps, and they love melons. I think they're melons. So, four guys get into this big circle filled with fargans and they throw these melons back and forth. They use sticks with metal baskets at the end. Do you play monkey-in-the-middle on Denobula? Anyway, after a while, the fargans start figuring out what's going on, and Thanks, Doc. Commander. (Travis leaves.)
Three hours at their present speed. [Shran's command post] They just dropped out of warp. They'll be here in thirteen minutes. Fifty thousand kilometres. They're still heading right for the Vulcan ships. Aye, sir. The Andorians are following, sir.
We're more than thirty light years from the nearest trade route. I don't see how he could have made it out this far. There's nothing here that looks like a power source. They're moving off. I've lost them, sir. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've contacted the Vulcan ship Tal'Kir. They've agreed to meet us in three days to take the craft back to Earth. Hopefully, we won't have another visit from the Suliban before we reach the rendezvous point. [Engineering] (The device from the Tardis is open, and looks like it has control crystals in it.) Twenty thousand kilometres and closing. We're losing speed. Captain. (Enter the Tholians) Engines are down. All of them. The Tholians are on an intercept course. Two of their ships are approaching the saucer section. Eighty metres. forty.
The transport's dropped out of warp. It's entered a binary system. Looks like they're heading for the fourth planet. There's a small vessel dropping out of warp. The fourth planet.
They're gaining on us, sir. (The pursuing ship breaks open and engulfs little Enterprise.) How do we know the security officers are okay? Go ahead, sir. I'm on my way. [Mess hall] (T'Pol and Phlox are at a table having drinks while lots of crew are getting meals and socialising.) One of those things just followed me up the starboard strut, but when I got into the catwalk it didn't come through. There must be something keeping it from getting in here. [Bridge] I'm fine, sir. Thank you. I saw him down near the Command Compartment. How many of them are there? I'm not sure. Are you doing all right? I'm sure the Captain will get us out as soon as he can. Has anyone seen Commander Tucker? Thanks. [Locker room] (Phlox is getting into a space suit.) Sorry, Captain, I can't find Commander Tucker. I'll look again. [Atmosphere control] (Phlox is reading the numbers on the panels.) The Captain asked me to find you. He needs you in the Command Compartment. Commander! (Tucker breaks into a run, knocking crewmen aside then goes to open the hatch.) You can't go out there, sir. It's not safe! (He gets pushed away.) What are you doing? (Travis gets hit, hard, then Tucker goes down the ladder to the main body of the ship.) [Corridor] We've got a problem, Captain. Commander Tucker. He just went out the forward hatch. I tried to stop him, sir. He didn't look like himself. I think one of those things got inside him. (at the helm) Yes, sir. [Corridor]
Their port engine is venting reactor coolant. I can try to come in on the starboard side, but it'll be tricky. If we could disable their engines. What's this Rura Pente like?
Mayweather. HOSHI [OC] The captain wants you to report to the Bridge. Admiral Forrest called a few minutes ago. We're reversing course. I'm on my way. [Situation room] This system's almost thirty light years behind us. Aye, sir. [Ready room] Do you have a minute, sir? I was wondering if I could make a personal request. My family's ship, the Horizon, we're going to be passing close to it. I wouldn't mind going by for a visit. It's about ten hours off our flight path. Enterprise can still get to the planet with time to spare. You could pick me up on the way back. Thank you, sir. My father's been ill for a few months. My mother said he'll be fine. She's the ship's medic. She's both. My grandfather held the record. Five jobs at one time, two of them on the bridge. You, sir? Why didn't you sign up? I'd appreciate that, sir. [Engineering] Starfleet really ought to think about putting families on starships. No one would ever get homesick. On a cargo ship, you can't walk ten metres without running into your baby-sitter or a great-aunt. (gets communicator out of pocket) Go ahead. Thanks, Hoshi. Put it through to my quarters. Captain's personal log, January 10, 2153. We're on course for our rendezvous with the Horizon. Unfortunately, I've just received word that Ensign Mayweather's family is facing an unexpected tragedy. [Enterprise's 'sweet spot'] Of course not. Every now and then. My mother sent a message to Starfleet six weeks ago, but I never got it. I should have called him. We were in comm. range a few months ago. I guess I wasn't ready to talk to him yet. He wasn't very happy with me when I joined Starfleet. He'd been grooming me for his job since I was kid. With all respect, sir, I'm not so sure he was. What did he say? I wish he would have told me that. [Sickbay] The Horizon's fifty years old. I'm sure you've seen far more impressive warp reactors. What's this? Thank you, sir. We ran into a small wavefront a few months ago. The crew had to squeeze into one of the nacelles for a couple of days. She probably made it sound worse than it was. It was really just a misunderstanding. They thought Enterprise had been abandoned. Captain Archer convinced them to leave. How'd you know about that? Charlie must be at the helm. His warp jumps were always a little rough. Where are we headed? Hey! (They embrace.) Do you always have to bring that up? I will. (They carry on further down the corridor then Travis turns left.) Guest quarters are over here. I can't believe you kept this. (a paper starchart up on the wall) I've still got a ways to go. Me, too. (they hug) We're going to get through this, Mom. Are you sure you're old enough to drive that thing? Acting captain. Don't let it go to your head. The jacket looks good on you. Business must be good. I've never seen this module so full. If you need me to help out with anything. See you at dinner? (Paul nods, and Travis goes to leave.) I'm just working on a few upgrades. You were busy. I didn't want to bother you. You're going to love this. You know those port stabilisers that were always acting up? Before I left, I spoke with Commander Tucker. Our Chief Engineer, on Enterprise. He showed me how to reconfigure the spatial discriminators. Shouldn't give you any more trouble. Whatever you say, sir. Come in. Word travels fast. (They embrace.) Thanks. (She sees one of his old toys.) I don't know. I thought it might be fun to regress for a while. What do you say we turn off the grav-plating and jump on the bed? Keeps us busy. We've gone a hundred and fifty light years, seen twenty two inhabited worlds. You can't believe what's out there. Just a few days. I'm afraid not. I doubt Magellan got much time off, either. What's wrong? What do you mean? He's always on edge. My mother hasn't mentioned any of this. He's only been in command a few weeks. Give him a chance. He'll grow into it. Thanks. (The ship judders.) Charlie at the helm? That's no turbulence. (They are being shot at by two ships.) [Horizon Bridge] What's going on? By who? You're hauling thirty thousand metric tons. You're not going to be able to outrun them. They're still closing. They attached something to the hull. I wouldn't recommend that. This is a dicobalt signature, a high-yield explosive. If anyone gets too close, it might decide to go off. (Senior staff gather at the back of the small Bridge to see a display on a monitor.) What kind of weapons does the Constellation have? What happens if they come back before we arrive? We had some trouble with them. We managed to knock out their engines with our phase cannons. I can tie the plasma turrets directly into the impulse engines. Lieutenant Reed did that and it increased our yield by eighty percent. If there's one thing I've learned from Captain Archer, it's that you don't give in to people like this. You're only going to encourage more attacks, not just against you, but other cargo ships. If those aliens come back, you'll thank me. You may not have a choice. Paul. I didn't mean to undermine your authority. But you're being unreasonable. I just want us to be prepared. It's still my home. Is that what this is about? Me leaving? If you want to be an effective captain, you've got to set your personal feelings aside, listen to what other people have to say. No, your father. He said that to me a long time ago. If he was here now, he'd tell you the same thing. That isn't fair. You want to stand around feeling sorry for yourself, go ahead. I've got better things to do. I'm just trying to help you, Paul. In case you haven't noticed, you could use a little help right now. You want to take them offline? Do it yourself. [Horizon mess] I knew how Paul would react. I didn't want to drag you into it. (picking at his food) Never thought I'd actually miss these. Not just any Nutri-pak, strawberry shortcake. The first time I tasted real shortcake was in San Francisco. It just wasn't the same. I wouldn't mind eating like this again. I'm thinking about asking for an extended leave. I'm sure Captain Archer would approve, considering. As long as I'm needed. I'm not the only helm officer. There's a lot for me to do here. I can help upgrade the guidance and warp systems. With a little luck, we could make Horizon the fastest J-class in the fleet. My career's the last thing on my mind right now. He's not ready, Mum. You don't think I should stay. A lot has changed in four years, Mum. I'll try to keep that in mind. Good night. (He kisses her.) They're charging weapons. If I can get a clear shot, but I can't do that as long as they're behind us. It's going to be tough to manoeuvre with thirty kilotons of cargo. We've got to cut it loose. I'm sure it'll come back to me. (He takes over from Juan.) They're closing. Forty metres, thirty. Ten metres. (The cargo tug flies free of the modules, with the cruiser in pursuit and firing.) I'm coming around again. (More carefully placed shots and the cruiser grinds to a halt.) Aye, Captain. [Room B6] (Travis is back in Starfleet uniform and packing to leave.) Come in. Wouldn't want to wear out my welcome. If you like, I'll speak with Lieutenant Reed. I'm sure he can help you remove that alien beacon. What? We haven't travelled quite that far. You can count on it. (they shake hands) Maybe sooner. Thank you, sir. (they walk along the corridor) They're okay. Probably an old meteorite impact. Never better, sir. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek Â® is copyright of CBS Studios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are for educational and entertainment purposes only.
 These caverns go on for fifty kilometres.  Pitons.
Aye, sir. (Just Archer and Trip are left.) About an hour. They're going to warp. They're accelerating, warp four point nine six, nine eight We're closing. They're dropping to impulse. Hull plating's at twenty three percent. [Arctic transport] (They find a figure standing in one of the alcoves, immobile and oblivious to their presence, then another. Two creatures walk towards them, a male and a smaller female. They shoot them successfully.)
  I see him. Eight hundred thousand kilometres. 
It'll take a while to get back, sir. Two hundred kilometres off port. Warp three, sir. Sir? Aye, sir. Captain's starlog, supplemental. We've been travelling at warp five for seven weeks. The crew is anxious to begin our mission. [Bridge] (The ship is approaching a purple haze.) Nearly a million kilometres. It's not that dense all the way through, is it? They're keeping up with us, sir. (more weapons hits) I can try, sir. Captain. (A big black cloud is ahead.) I hope you don't ask me to do that too often, sir.
Go ahead. Understood. (There's weapons fire coming from the dark. Kessick is shot in the back.)
 We're losing main power. [Engineering]  Sir, I'm picking up a vessel eight million kilometres off port.  The trail ends about twenty thousand kilometres ahead.  Something's passing through the cloaking field.
 Go ahead.  They're hailing us.
Aye sir. (The two ships vanish, as if they were going into a sphere cloaking field.) [Corridor] Those ships just entered some kind of vortex. They're gone. [Sickbay]
 Grab a seat, Commander.
Go ahead, sir.
It broke orbit five minutes ago, Captain.
The helmâs not responding. The starboard injectors are fused.
We can't transport six thousand people back to Earth.
 Shuttlepod two. Acknowledged. (Off they go and put grapples onto the main hull.) [Bridge]  Thrust vector holding steady. [Bridge]  I've got a temperature warning light. [Shuttlepod One]  Twelve kilometres per hour and accelerating. [Bridge]
Like they came off an assembly line. Power fluctuations. (The lights go out, then come on again.) We're coming up on the outer edge of the cloaking barrier. [Alien ship] (Watching the shuttlepod come into view again.) We're dropping out of warp. There's a convoy of ships approaching.
They broke orbit five minutes ago, Captain.
Radiation from the debris field. It's starting to affect our systems. The port hydraulics are acting up. They're not responding. I'll try to do better next time, sir. [Degra's ship] (The unconscious crew are being placed in their seats.)
I can't understand it, Captain. It's like the stars keep shifting positions. There, they just did it again. I've already run two diagnostics. I can't find anything wrong. Helm's not responding. Helm's back online. Love to. [Launch bay] Good, sir. We're adjusting the nav sensors to compensate for the gravimetric waves. Just need a day to upload and test these corrections. (Travis leaves.) Good match. (He shakes his opponent's hand,)
No, sir. For an Insectoid, maybe they are comfortable. You could probably fly this thing inside a gas giant. This icon looks like it might represent the impulse manifolds. I don't think this ship likes us very much. [Mess hall] What about the ship on the surface? We might be able to salvage what we need. Every day we stay here gives them more time to finish their weapon. A subspace vortex is opening off the port bow. They're firing. (Enterprise rocks to the impact.) TRAVIS: They're moving away at full impulse. No effect. Aye, sir.
I know these controls aren't exactly intuitive.
Thrusters are down. I don't think we're going anywhere. [Degra's ship] There's a vessel approaching. Still offline. Aye sir. Almost sounds like music. It's never too late. You can start when we get home. We're getting home. [Engineering] Why don't we just transport their warp coil to Enterprise? Two hundred kilometres. Our port thrusters are offline.
We're approaching the coordinates, Captain. Right on schedule. Maybe they're running late? (The ship shudders.) Aye, sir. Aye, sir. (They emerge at a Sphere.) He's nearly reached the Reptilians. (As Degra's ship flies past, he fires twice.)
Aye, sir. Whoever they are, they're on an intercept course. We're losing speed. Captain, the stars. They're not where they're supposed to be. Who's the father? Why not? You've got to be curious. Corporal Mackenzie. We talked after a training session once. Please. I'm on duty in a few minutes. Warp engines just went offline. Our plasma injectors are disengaged. They're making a run for it. Two thousand metres. Six minutes. We're increasing speed. They've engaged a tractor beam. Forty five seconds to the corridor. The stars are where they're supposed to be.
But it's close. Moving fast. left quadrant.
What have we missed? Have they launched it? Who? We'll have to pull back. Aye, sir. (An Aquatic ship gets mangled by the transformed space) [Degra's ship] What about the anomalies? Aye, sir. [Weapon Control area]
Sphere Forty One. Yep. There shouldn't be anything on sensors, not with the cloaking barrier, but there it is and it's getting bigger. Could be spatial anomalies, but they're clustered much tighter than we've ever seen them. [Sickbay] When? Sir. That's tying my hands, Commander, especially with the ticking clock. It's too soon. Twenty thousand kilometres. Fifteen degrees north. Aye. Me too. I'm picking up explosions on E deck. How's that possible? Eight hundred thousand kilometres. I'm not picking up the orbital platforms. It's not just Yosemite. There's nothing coming from any of them. Looks pretty normal to me. Finally. We've got three vessels approaching. Sir. (Anti-aircraft flax is steaming up from the ground and three propeller driven USAF aircraft are coming at them.) [Field Hospital] (Conscious but badly wounded people are being tended by nurses and doctors. One nurse whispers to a doctor tapping at a big old typewriter. The background chatter is German, there is a swastika flag on the wall, the dialogue is in subtitles.)
Those are P-51s. I've seen them at air shows. Are they breaking off? Maybe we should follow them. Starboard injector. Maybe we're here for a reason. Maybe this wasn't an accident. Bay one is depressurising. Someone's launching a shuttlepod. Hard to believe we're only a few kilometres from New York City.
Aggressive? I overheard them talking. They mentioned something about a Temporal conduit. I know it sounds crazy, but I think it's a time machine. Aye. [Nazi Weapons Facility] (Archer is exchanging weapons fire with a group of soldiers.) Captain. (The viewscreen shows a half-lit blue and white planet.)
You had to wear that jacket. You're not chasing anyone out of here. You heard him. Step away from the table. (The man tries to take a swing at Reed, but misses by a mile. A bar brawl instantly ensues.)
I remember Soong's trial. He wouldn't say what he did with the embryos he stole. Not a pretty thought. We're dropping out of warp. There's another ship. (The Bird of Prey blasts one Interceptor to pieces.)
Range twenty million kilometers. Course set. Five thousand kilometres. The bird-of-prey's moving to intercept.
They've dropped to impulse. Another fifteen seconds.
Lieutenant, here's the junction room. (They pick their way carefully through the twisted wreckage, using torches and scanners.) Schematics say the secondary security bank's right in there. There's a weak power signature under this mess. Lieutenant. Why not beam the bomb out of here? Attempt? That can't be good.
We should be ready within the hour. I've rigged up a stick-and-rudder system. It'll get us where we want to go, [Situation room] Thank you, sir. Understood. These thermals are only going to get stronger. (They're hit by weapons fire.) We must be getting close to the geomagnetic field. They must have better shielding. We've lost part of the starboard wing. I think I can get us down. Thrusters are offline. We'll have to fire the chemical rockets. Hang on. [Bridge]
Sir. (Three ships appear on the viewscreen.) Sir, the Andorians are moving toward the nebula. Navigation just went offline. I've lost them. Sir, I'm reading a massive subspace distortion. We're being targeted. (Big bangs.) I've lost helm control.
You'll win in eight moves. (Reed turns the board around so they can set up a fresh game.) Thirty two pieces, sixty four squares. It's not as if it's difficult. The total number of possible outcomes is limited. That's what I mean. Chess is so predictable, I'm surprised anyone bothers to play it. (The new game starts quickly, with Travis playing white.) What a waste. I know the rules. Observation without interference. (Another speed-chess game finishes already.) You'll win in five moves. How do you think they'll react to what's on this planet? Do you think our hosts will die tonight? But somebody always dies. I studied your report on how the Klingons reacted to the infection. The Klingon commander didn't let his landing party back on his ship. Captain Archer did. So it doesn't matter if an infected landing party comes aboard. Oh, I don't know. They're showing concern for each other. The Cardassians did that when they were here, didn't they? Maybe the humans will surprise us. Commander, Hoshi. Just wanted to say hi. Can you tell me what's in the hypospray? Have either of you faced serious illness before? I was curious to know how you'd compare this experience with other illnesses you might've contracted. I only have a few more questions. But [Sickbay] (Phlox is putting a culture slide under a microscope.) The Doctor identified the pathogen. But no one's made the decision to abandon the infected crew members. We're looking for signs of elevated intelligence in the species we observe. I'm sure Captain Archer knows exactly what the risk is. Maybe it's not as important to him as standing by his crew. There's a way to be sure. Which is why we should inhabit the Doctor and the Science Officer. Archer relies on their findings to make his decisions. We could witness that as it happens. The more people we inhabit, the more we'll be able to observe. [Decon chamber] You've detected a debris cloud in orbit. Captain, does knowing what the Klingons did help us at all? But if they had developed one, you'd ask them for it, right? We can stop what this virus is doing to them. We came to observe their response to the unexpected, not to watch them suffer. I know where we can talk undisturbed. [Decon chamber] (The two unconscious patients sit up to talk.) In eight hundred years, no one's ever done that before? How many have to die before you'll admit humans are different? We need to stop this. What more will that teach us about them? Maybe we should be. [Sickbay] Good. I'm looking forward to making my first report. After ten thousand years, the rules need to change. [Corridor] I don't think we can avoid them. I'm going to recommend that we start preparations for an official First Contact mission. Then we'd better get started. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek Â® is copyright of CBS Studios Inc.

They have no ships within range. Two hours. Our warp field's destabilising. We're dropping to impulse. Starboard thrusters are down. They're moving off. Sir. (On the viewscreen, they see the ship start moving, taking pot shots at them as it goes past.) We're losing hull plating. Warp four point nine. Warp five. (Things are still going bang on the Bridge.) Five point oh two. Point oh four. Five point oh six. The injector's stabilised. We're holding speed. The one thing they couldn't mask is their power signature. That's why they
Why does Starfleet think this is connected to the other incidents? Didn't expect to find you up this late. Too wired to sleep. Hard to believe the Captain's going to be fighting a duel to the death in a few hours. What are you looking at? The last I heard, the Captain sounded determined to go through with it. Two of us could get through that a lot faster. [Mess hall] (The table is covered in PADDs.) Look at this. Either combatant can postpone a duel indefinitely if there are no children to continue his clan. As far as I know, Captain Archer doesn't have any kids. If he's killed, his clan would die with him. Don't suppose we can find him a wife in the next four hours. Instead of looking for a loophole, maybe we should be trying to find a way for the Captain to win. Have you ever been to Nobelia Prime? The tribal elders there, they can challenge you to a duel if you look at them the wrong way. Happened to my father. Which one of these has the combat rules? [Cargo bay] (Both sides have assembled, and Hoshi is giving a last minute lesson on how to use the Ushann Tor.) Intercept in forty seven minutes. One minute. They're targeting our warp core. Hull plating's at forty three percent. (another bang) Thirty six percent.
One hundred kilometres.
At our current speed, eight point two hours. They're going to warp. The helm's not responding. [Sickbay] (The captured alien is strapped to a biobed.) There's a malfunction in the intermix chamber. Plasma pressure's rising. Pressure's approaching critical. Sir, we can't hold that speed for long. Acknowledged. To Be Continued... <Back to the episode listing Star Trek Â® is copyright of CBS Studios Inc. Copyright Â© 1966, Present.

Coming up on one hundred metres. Ninety, eighty metres. We're at fifty metres and holding. Sir, I'm having trouble holding position. Fifty two metres. Fifty five. [Just outside Enterprise Launch bay] Fifty nine metres. [Launch bay] (Tucker appears to have made it inside the doors.) We've got warp power. [Engineering] Six hours, sir. The lead ship's moving into a lower orbit. They're shifting their orbit.
I was fifteen. I couldn't think straight. I could barely breathe. Only thing that got me through it was weight training with my dad. He said if I was exhausted, idle hands and all that
Yes, sir. And Captain, if I may? I'd like to be the first to congratulate you on a brilliant strategy. I'm certain that in years to come. Aye, Captain. (But to who,, we're not sure.) (Travis leaves.)
Sir. (Archer turns to the viewscreen, to see another Web being constructed.) Direct hits. Target destroyed. Weapons are locked. The warp field's fluctuating. I'll alert the Captain. Main power's offline. We've dropped out of warp. [ISS Avenger - Bridge] Everything's offline. [ISS Avenger - Bridge] Primary systems are coming back. We have shields. Weapons are online. They're trying to escape.
Just missing a few names. For what? You were busy working. How have you been, Gannet? At least until the conference is over. Can't argue with that. What are you doing here? A story? I've got some work to do. Gannet. (She switches off the camera.) He know how you feel about space exploration? That it's the last vestige of colonial impulse? Find another story to do. Then you're going to have to find another source for your information. Can you give me one reason why I shouldn't avoid you? And it looks like you've changed your mind. That's the first honest thing you've said. That was some serious flying, trying to keep the warp fields aligned. Columbia was fifty metres above us. One wrong move and we would've lost Commander Tucker. When I was studying to be a pilot, I memorised something Chuck Yeager said. I never let myself be afraid. I just focus on the dials and concentrate on flying. Most of the time, simple works best. [Launch bay] These are the shuttlepods. Shuttlepod One. Do you want to see inside? I always thought so. Unfortunately, we use the shuttlepods less and less. We're getting more comfortable with the transporter. Yeah, but there's no skill involved. I've always had a tendency to get attached to machines. It's crazy, but every time we use the transporter, I feel we're kind of turning our backs on these guys. When I saw you at that conference, I started thinking about things, decisions I've made. Don't do that. Whenever things get a little serious, you always turn it into a joke. You and your bad habits. (They get into a serious clinch.) [Conference room] I'm glad we finally left the shuttlepod. I like flying them. What was that? I'm just worried about some friends of mine. I'm under orders not to talk about it. Let's change the subject. How come you haven't settled down? And what constitutes the right circumstance? I've spent my whole life in space, going from one place to the next. Seeing you, I was wondering, maybe the next challenge, at least for me, is to stay in one place for a while. (They kiss. Again.) [Bridge] All that stuff I said about leaving the ship. What's going on? Maybe she was after a story. It doesn't mean she worked for Terra Prime. Aye.
I have experience with comets, sir. We're within range. Aye, aye, sir. [Brig] (Travis is in thermal clothing to pay a jail visit.) What's so urgent? You'll have to talk to the Captain. We all are. That's it? That's not possible. (He opens the cell door and goes in.) If you were an S.I. agent, you'd be out of this Brig with one call to your division head. Mayweather, Go ahead. On my way. You know I'm going to tell the Captain about this. Probably not. Why are you telling me this now? So you're revealing all of this because you're worried about me. I'm touched. (He leaves the cell and locks the door.) You're not going to manipulate me again. Goodbye. [Launch bay] Hull plating's steady at ninety four percent. We need to maintain an erratic flight profile, so we look like a chunk of the comet. I'm taking us closer to the nucleus. It's going to start getting a little rough. The gravity's starting to tear the comet apart. (Reed has made use of the bag Phlox gave him.) The engine shut down, but there were no warning lights. The console's locked up. Bypassing auto flight control. Switching to manual! We're out of options. (Their flight levels off, and the heat shield blackens.) Ground proximity? I was thinking the same thing. You'll want to keep your arms inside the vehicle at all times. (He takes them in to land.) [Mars] Hmm? Commander. I can't figure out why the console locked up at the same time the engines shut down. Flight control and engine power are routed separately. until they reach that junction. The panel's open. If ionised gas got in here, it could've melted the primary circuits of both systems. No. It's been forced. This was deliberate. [Kelby's quarters] Is this your signature? It's a first step. The Captain says it's going to take years to work out the details. Just doing my job. I know. A lot of details to work out. (This angle shows us they are at the Transporter alcove.) The least I can do is give you a ride. (He takes her hand.) The Launch Bay's this way. [T'Pol's quarters]
