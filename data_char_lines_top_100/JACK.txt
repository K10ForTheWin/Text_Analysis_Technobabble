That's Admiral Patrick. We're mutants. Why are you so upset? You wanted Sarina brought here. Well, here she is! (Sarina is sitting quietly on a biobed.) Well don't worry, we'll help you. And when we're through with Sarina, she will be just like us. We didn't get caught, did we? Of course. But when they did, Patrick would say Of course she remembers you. She's not an idiot. Why are we doing this, anyway? Here? Oh, what difference does it make? Fine. (kicks it.) How's that? Well, well? What did the Captain say? See? See? I told you it was a good idea to bring her here. So, when do we operate? You're going to need some help. How hard can it be? Oh, I get it. You want to take all the credit. Fine. I'm busy anyway. New project. Wouldn't you like to know? Your friend was right. You can't break the laws of physics. (They've augmented the medical probe with a tricorder fastened to it and lots of wires.) We recalibrated the imaging diodes. It is so accurate that you could clip the wings of an angel dancing on the head of a pin. If you wanted to. [Surgery] (Sarina lying on the operating table with the probe behind her. She's put to sleep. We see Bashir operating with red and green lights going into Sarina's head. Later, it's all finished and she's lying on a biobed, eyes wide open. The group are waiting in the cargo bay.) Maybe I did. Maybe I didn't. It was my idea to bring you here. Aren't you going to thank me? Why are you talking like that? (mimics) There's so much I want to say to all of you. There's so much I want to say to all of you. Practice! Ah, practice. Good idea. Listen to this, Sarina. (sings a sol-fa scale) Do ray mi fa so la ti do. Are you tone deaf? Do ray mi fa so la ti. Let's improvise. Lauren. Do ray me do ray me. Fa me ray do. (Bashir applauds.) Molto allegro. (And the group moves on into four part harmony and I give up trying to transcribe it.) [Quark's] The fact is that the universe is going to stop expanding and it is going to collapse in on itself. We've got to do something before it's too late. Sixty trillion years, seventy at the most. What are you doing? We are running out of time! (Sarina enters.) Sarina, thank God! Nobody else around here ever listens to me. There's too much matter. The universe is too heavy for its own good. Yes, yes, yes, exactly. We have to find some way to decrease the mass. That's the whole point. Change the cosmological constant. You know something, Sarina? We are trying to save existence as we know it, and all you can do is criticise! Thank you. Now, where were we? Right. Right. (Later, Bashir arrives as promised to discover Sarina sitting staring at nothing. The display title is now How To Avert Disaster...) Doctor! Glad you're here. Sarina, are you all right? She's fine. Listen, you have to talk to Starfleet for us. We need subspace field generators, lots of them. Later? There isn't going to be a later, later. (goes back to work) Now, once we get the field generators When should we be ready? Figures. You have no right to do this. No right! We did not help you so you could take her away from us! Why? Because we're not normal? Because we're crazy? Oh, who wants to be normal anyway? We're better than they are. You don't see any of them trying to save the universe from collapsing, do you? Let's get back to work. [Promenade] Why should we help you? You just want to steal her away from us. Are you sure? Why? This way we can all stay together. (Lauren gets the door open.) This way. Tell him. But we think it has something to do with you.
(fast talking man) No. No. It's not fair. Am I alone here? Is that it? Am I the only one who sees. And what is that incessant noise? Why? Am I talking too fast, Doctor? Having trouble keeping up? You know why they brought us here, don't you? Why they carted us halfway across the quadrant? They're going to experiment on us. They want to find out what makes our genetically engineered brains tick. They're going to cut our heads open and see what comes out! (Patrick cries.) No, no. He's not like us. I never saw him at the Institute. He wasn't locked away for being too smart. He's passed himself off as normal. He's Mister Normal Starfleet man. Mister Productive Member of Society. Well, maybe we can learn to be just like him. Wear little uniforms. Yes, sir. No, sir. Thank you, sir. No. No. This isn't happening. Give me that! See that? That's what I'm going to do to your boyfriend. Sorry. I'll work on it. Funny. He doesn't look like a mutant. He knows me. He knows my name. I didn't tell him my name. I knew that. What is he talking to her for? He read the reports. She won't answer. Didn't you read the reports? Would anyone mind if he turned on some lights? Go ahead. We're not mole people, you know. Bashir, was it? Rings a bell. Bashir, Bashir, Bashir, Bashir. Ah ha, got it! Fifteenth century poet Singh el Bashir. Any relation? His work was totally derivative. He was a plagiarist. You knew that. You had to know. Yet you came in here bragging about it anyway. Why? What was I supposed to do, just let you get away with it? That noise! Can you do that? What happened? Your parents couldn't afford the full overhaul? You're not exactly known for being very discriminating. And you're still regretting it. The cube root of three hundred twenty nine. What is it? No, no, no. He is not like us. No. He passed as normal. So no one would suspect. Very clever. I'm impressed. That's not right. There are reasons why DNA resequencing is illegal. There are reasons why people like us are barred from serving in Starfleet. We have an advantage. Normal people can't compete. It's not fair. There are rules. Don't talk with your mouth full. Don't open an airlock when somebody's inside it. And don't lie about your genetic status. No, no, no. You did, you lied. And then, when you got caught, you cut a deal with Starfleet. You got yourself off the hook. He's right, you know. Then they would have put you away. No, no, no, no they just won't let us do anything that's worth doing. No, no. They are afraid that people like us are going to take over. Oh, no, no. I knew you were going to do that. I knew you were going to trot out the Eugenics Wars. Here it comes. The we can still contribute speech. No. No, no, no, no. I will not forget what was done to me. I will not be part of a society that put me away for being too smart. No, no. What, you think we don't eat? We eat. We're going to eat right now. Yum yum. Don't worry about us, we'll be fine. Can you hear me? Hello? Calling Doctor Bashir. Hello? Anybody there? Hello? Hello? Doctor Bashir? I can't take it! Would you do something about that noise! (They're all behaving as if they're in pain. Even Sarina is covering her ears.) What kind of sick game are you people playing? Can't you hear it? Yes. Thank god! See, I told you we weren't crazy. (hugs Bashir) You are a mutant. You are. (grabs Sarina) Now, do something about that noise or I will snap her neck. (After the break.) Maybe I'll wait till he gets here. You think I want to be doing this? I'm just making sure things get done. (Jack releases Sarina.) Unbelievable. This is the thanks I get. Well, why don't you fix it, dear fellow, dear fellow, well why don't you fix it before I go mad. Finally. Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown. Methought I heard a voice cry, Sleep no more! Damar does murder sleep! Pretender! You don't belong on that throne and you know it. No, no, no, but it's obvious who he is. The Pretender who killed the king and seized the throne. And now the Pretender finds himself in league with a, a Dark Knight that he can't control. It's not a bad story. Epic, really. What else can you tell us? [Ops] So the Pretender and his Dark Knight are coming to the station? Computer, freeze programme. Computer. (beep) Hi. Er, listen. Go to native language mode and replay time code seven six one through seven six nine. Got you. Did you hear that? He used the passive voice transitive. Since this morning. That phrasing is only used to make a request, not a statement. They are up to something. Told you they were up to something. Yes, yes, yes. That's a typical Dominion strategy. They offer to give up something valuable in order to hide the fact that they want something even more valuable in the long term. See, that's how they think. Big picture. They don't worry about what's going to happen tomorrow, no, no, no, they're thinking long term. They're thinking what's going to happen a year from now, a decade, a century. Yes, yes. Okay, okay, okay. Maybe there's another reason. Does it have any strategic value? (Bashir notices Sarina writing on a PADD.) Why not? Why not? Seems perfectly suitable. All right, forget that. Think, think. Any evidence that Kabrel used to support an advanced civilisation? Maybe they're looking to excavate something valuable like an ancient technology. Imagine that, Starfleet Command. He's just jealous you're spending so much time with us. We have new long term projections. You'd better take a look. Well? So then you agree with our conclusion? I knew it. They're the cowards! They don't have the courage to see the truth. No, no, no. We can't just take this lying down. The stakes are too high. We've got to take matters into our own hands. If we can't head off the war, then there might be a way to make it a lot less bloody. Look at this. Starfleet battle plans, fleet deployments. Do you know what the Dominion could do with this information? With a lot fewer Federation casualties than in a drawn out war. That's a lot better than nine hundred billion. Maybe not, but we're the next best thing. I don't care. I'm willing to make this decision. Not closed! We're going through with this. Call it what you want, but I am willing to do it if it means saving billions of lives. So are you with us? Fine. (Jack knocks out Bashir. He lands in Lauren's lap and she caresses his body.) Patrick! Come on. (They walk round a corner and meet security and ...) No, no, no he's not. I don't understand. No, we've got to do this. Lives are at stake. You have no right. It doesn't matter what happens to us. Don't you realise what you've done? Didn't you sit here and go through the projections with us? Didn't you? How can you say that? We factored in every contingency, every variable. The equations don't lie. You. You ruined everything. Not so fast. There's one thing I need to know, Doctor. If we can come up with a way to beat the Dominion, will you listen? Good, good, good. Let's go then. Let's go.
