We need you, Seven. (A cacophony of overlapping voices and groans.)
Voyager to Lieutenant Paris. How's it going out there, Tom? Good work. See you when you get back. Chakotay out. [Corridor] Voyager here. Say again, Tom. Your signal's breaking up. Repeat that, Tom. Voyager to Lieutenant Paris. Come in. [Mess hall] Neurogenic field. If I can wake him up [Cavern] I'm giving you an order! [Cavern] In five minutes. Understood?
Captain, we have an unauthorised launch in progress. [Bridge]
Captain to the bridge. Understood. We're preparing to shut down the holodeck.
I've found her. Lock on to the [Frozen Bridge] Go ahead. We're on our way. Speed it up. We've got a Galaxy class starship on our tail. Yes, ma'am. Acknowledged. Coming back there?
Chakotay to Paris and Kim. Report to the bridge.
Captain to the bridge. Bridge to Captain Janeway. We're approaching the vacuoles. We're receiving a distress call. We're receiving a distress call. The Vidiians are in retreat. Everything all right down there? Captain to the bridge.
Understood.
No, I left an hour ago. What? Let's check outside. Maybe some of the insect traps are still intact.
Not yet!  [Maquis ship] (The little ship takes a direct hit from the Kazon. It streams flames.)
Suder, what are you doing with a comm. badge?
Proceed to deck eleven, Keep you comm. links open. How long?
Harry, I know you're not feeling well, but I need you and Neelix up here. How are you transmitting this signal that far? I have an idea how to shut it down. [Janeway's apartment] I'm having trouble with my transceiver. This may be to last chance we have to talk.
Chakotay to Seven of Nine. Report to Shuttlebay two. It's very calm. No gravimetric distortions. The EM activity is creating a natural luminescence. Tom called it mood lighting. We've detected asteroid fragments, pieces of vessels, matter from every quadrant of the galaxy. Next time I lose something I'll know where to look. Instead of a graviton ellipse we should call it the kitchen sink anomaly. The chemical interactions have even created a primitive atmosphere. We didn't feel a thing. Acknowledged. [Delta Flyer]
Mister Kim, please report to the Bridge. Chakotay to crew. Battle stations. [Cave]
Chakotay to Captain Janeway. Looks like our friends in orbit have found us.
Bridge to the Captain. We've been hailed by a representative of the Bothan government. They'd like to talk to you.
Bridge to the Captain. We've reached the source of those energy readings and I thought you'd like to see what we've found.
Bridge to Janeway. You must not discuss with me what you see, or you will offend your animal guide. As you continue to look around, you will become aware of other life that shares this place with you. It will be the first animal you see. That is the one you will speak to. Do you see an animal? (There is a lizard on a sandy log.) Speak to it. You know what you want to ask. [Ready room] (The doorbell brings her back with a jolt.) All personnel report to stations. Yellow alert. Sorry.  [Bridge]
Chakotay to the bridge. Iâ€™ve spoken to Seven of Nine. We're putting her into stasis. Seven's trapped us behind some kind of Borg forcefield.
Chakotay here, Captain. [Bridge]  Bridge to Janeway. You'd better come in here, Captain.
Bridge to Captain.
We're experiencing [Bridge]
Chakotay to Tuvok and Kim. Report to the bridge.
Rescue team alpha to Seven of Nine. We need that data. Not yet. (Unseen, Naomi steps off the turbolift.) Have all teams rendezvous at my coordinates. Go ahead. Chakotay to Voyager. Pattern enhancers are in place. We're ready to transport the Flyer.
Paris broke out of confinement in Engineering. [Bridge]
Red Alert! Captain Janeway to the bridge. [Bridge] Acknowledged, Captain.
Go ahead. Acknowledged. (The lights come on and the Blue Danube waltz begins to play, slightly wrong.) [Corridor]
Go ahead, Captain. He wants to make. I'm trying to talk him out of it. Acknowledged. [Planet Surface] Acknowledged [Planet Surface] Chakotay to Seska.
We'll meet you there.
Report to Astrometrics. We've found something.
Captain's log, stardate 55836.2. Kes has remained in temporal sync with us for two days now, but since we don't know when she may jump again, we can't afford to rest until we've found some way to help her. [Medical laboratory]
Captain, a vessel just emerged from coaxial space off
Tuvok, would you mind joining me in the ready room? [Ready room]
Senior officers please report to the bridge. One minute we were reading an empty tunnel, and the next we walked [Tunnels]
Bridge to Captain Janeway. We're approaching the rogue planetoid, Captain. Keep looking. [Tunnel 3] Go ahead. Don't go any further [Tunnel] Let me guess, nothing there. Rendezvous at the Neelix, I said get back here! Neelix, did you hear what I said? Voyager to Captain Janeway. We've just picked [Bridge] Sorry, Captain. They went into warp too quickly.
Others no longer than a few days. In fact, one body arrived less than twelve hours ago. I don't know, Captain. [Cavern] I recommend we leave these bodies in peace, Captain. [Cavern] I understand the chance for scientific discovery, Captain [Cavern] Captain [Cavern] There's a vacuole forming on deck thirteen. Magnetic interlocks are stable.
Captain to the bridge. [Bridge]
Bridge to Captain Janeway. We're receiving another transmission. Looks like it.
I'm fine, Paris. Belay that, Voyager. Stand by. [Cave] Correct. [Cave] Chakotay out. [Cave] Chakotay to Away team. Captain, proceed with caution. I've been taken prisoner by a young Kazon. He's threatening to kill me.
Seven of Nine is in the pit. No time to explain. Beam her out of there. [Tsunkatse arena] I'm looking right at her! We're trying, but it's not easy. [Bridge] We need you to target their signal generators.
Chakotay to Janeway. Captain, we need you in Engineering. There's something here you should see. Good idea. Seven of Nine, stop what you're doing. You're human. A human individual. Our minds are linked. We are one. I can hear your thoughts I can see your memories. [Bridge] You remember being human. I see a young girl. A family. [Bridge] Listen to your human side. To yourself, the little girl. Seven of Nine. Annika!
Then all we need to do is locate these people and get their permission. You'd think [Clearing] Very odd. Like the flash of a memory, but it's someone I've never met. No. [Clearing]
Bridge to Torres. Report to Engineering on the double.
Chakotay to all senior officers. Please report to the Bridge.
You should be receiving the interlink frequency.
Bridge to Seven of Nine. We're approaching the debris field. Captain to the bridge.
All hands to battle stations. Krenim vessels approaching. Repeat, all hands to battle stations. Where are those shields?
Bridge to Captain Janeway. Captain, we're receiving a distress call in one of the lower subspace bands.
We've arrived. Bridge to Captain. They're locking onto the alien in sickbay.
We're on it. (Neelix, Janeway, Tuvok and Mabus are beamed away. The Trabe ship starts shooting at an apparently empty room. Voyager fires three photon torpedoes that explode in the atmosphere above it, and it flies away. The Kazon Majes get up from their hiding places and leave.) [Transporter room]
There may be intruders in Transporter Room two.
Go ahead. Acknowledged. (Fesek throws the contacts.)
What's your status? We're modifying a tractor pulse to slow you down. The arresting fields are in place. You're clear to land. B'Elanna, are you there?
Chakotay to the Captain. Our guests have arrived. They're being escorted to the briefing room.
Did you say Borg?
Standing by.
Aye Captain. (The shuttlecraft is launched.)
We're ready for you in the briefing room, Captain. Online.REG: Aye, Commander. What's wrong?
Chakotay to Voyager. We've found Tom and Harry. We've got [Planet surface] About two kilometres from the ship. Understood. I've got five to beam back. I can't explain it.
Captain, we haven't found any definite signs of Harry, but we've encountered several holodeck characters who claim to know what happened to him. Aye, Captain. Chakotay out. [Holodeck - Great Hall] How could it be in the holodeck? Hold on, Captain. [Holodeck - Great Hall]
Chakotay here, Captain. [Mountain path] JANEWAY
Go ahead. Aye, Captain. [Ready room] Captain to the Bridge. Voyager to Tuvok. Mister Paris has regained consciousness. I thought you'd want to know. Chakotay to Tuvok. You're needed on the Bridge. We're under attack by Numiri patrols.
Chakotay to Sickbay. Is the Doctor all right? Good work. As soon as you're finished there I want all senior officers to report to the bridge.
Doctor [EMH narrative - Bridge] Can you treat him? No. [EMH narrative - Bridge] I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we can't take the chance.
Captain to the bridge. I'm afraid not.
Acknowledged. Has your warp core been damaged? Go ahead. Understood. I'll be right there.
Senior officers report to the bridge.
Go ahead. Captain, can you read us? (Terla rips off her comm. badge.) Chakotay to Janeway, can you read me? Please respond. [On the way to the Power plant]
Seven of Nine to the bridge. Target obtained. [Bridge] But we also picked up some uninvited guests. Two minutes twelve seconds. They're not taking the bait. All systems go. False bioreadings are holding steady. Chakotay to away team. [Bridge] Three? We collapsed [Bridge] Raise shields. We've got company. [Bridge]
Acknowledged, Doctor. Set navigational controls to return to Voyager. Doctor, please respond. (The EMH gets Jetal's blood on his hands.) Doctor, stand by for transport.
We've detected Borg on the ship. Deck eight, science lab. Unknown, Tuvok's headed there now. All hands to battle stations. A Borg vessel is approaching.
