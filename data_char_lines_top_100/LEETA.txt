Oh, hello. It's the Trill Rite of Closure. I've read about it. They take care of the symbionts. Usually they're unjoined Trill. It comes in handy in my line of work. You never know who you'll meet at the dabo table. Me, too.
I've heard so much about you. It must have been a very delicate procedure. There. (Now Lady Quark is revealed.) You look nice. And stop looking down. There go his hormones. Would you stop staring at your chest. And while you're at it, we need to practice your walk. You're lumbering. That's good. You're so adorable, and complicated. Not if you're lumbering. First, we need to practice your walking. Let's try it again. (Quark enters, glides across the floor and sits nicely.) What's wrong now? Who could that be? Would someone please tell me what they're saying.
Stop saying that. Rom, we are not going to let them hurt you. Kira has gone to the Bajoran Council of Ministers. She's asking them to lodge an official protest. You do that and I'll work your dabo tables for free. An entire year. What are you talking about? They must have done something to his mind. What could be more important than your life? Oh, Rom.
Excuse me. You're Doctor Bashir, aren't you? I'm Leeta. I've been meaning to come by the Infirmary to see you. (cough, cough.) A few days now. Is it serious, Doctor? I'm sorry to hear that, Doctor. Leeta
Julian and I were talking it over and we'd like to come along, if that's all right. Oh, once we get to Risa, you won't even see us. Oh, thank you so much. I'm going to go pack. (Leeta leaves) He wouldn't give me any time off unless we promised to take him with us. Sorry. Let's see. That's a Tarkalean tea for you, a raktajino for you, and an extra large prune juice. Oh, it gives me something to do. Space travel's so dull. Have you ever noticed how all the stars look the same? Get it yourself. I'm on vacation. What's this? What's jamaharon? Oh. Look, they like each other. That's a good idea. Oh! I can't believe we finally made it. We will. (Bashir and Leeta leave.) Mmm. The truth is, not everyone can be a dabo girl. First of all, you have to be able to wear the clothes, and believe me, that's not easy. You have to be able to calculate odds in your head very quickly, and most importantly, you need a very supple wrist. Like this. Dabo. Oh, hi. Care to join us? We were just about to take a reyamilk soak. Julian? Oh, there you are. I am so glad we came here. I'm having the most wonderful time. Do you know what he's talking about? It's an old Bajoran custom. When a couple separates, they spend several days celebrating their parting. It's a way to remember all the good times, and to seek out new opportunities. You know, Julian, I don't think I've completely gotten you out of my system yet. Our paths have grown apart. (She drinks from a bowl.) The time of sharing is over. (breaks the bowl) May the Prophets guide you toward the path of happiness. That's it. Oh, I agree. Now I can finally be honest about my feelings. It's just in the past few months I've been thinking a lot about another man. I'd rather not discuss it now. It's Your brother, Rom. He's so cute. And very sexy. (Leeta leaves) I can't wait to get home. Not that I didn't enjoy myself.
I love syrup of squill on my groatcakes, but I haven't seen a jar in over a year. That's dishonest. Dax, Julian! You're back! I was so worried. Then why all the secrecy about your mission? Coming right up.
I heard the Federation fleet has been ambushed. How? Don't say that. Oh, Rom.
Excuse me. Do I know you? I don't think so. You're Ezri, right? Captain Smiley wants me to debrief you.
I like it. It shows off your legs. Have fun. Rom, you look terrible. I think you'd better lie down. But nobody's gambling. Can't you see he's sick? He needs to lie down. (From Rom's point of view, voices are getting fuzzy and the room is starting to spin.) What I do during my time off is no business of yours. Aren't you going to do something? Rom, how'd it go? Julian's a wonderful doctor. Your brother should have let you see him weeks ago. Really? Who's the lucky female? I'm sorry. I don't think Julian would approve. (sotto) What now? It's ridiculous. I can't afford a pay cut. So what are we going to do about it? A union. Yes. I hope Rom's voice holds out. And he'll have even less tomorrow. I've been talking to people all over the station and support for our cause is growing. What did he say? Who's Sean O'Brien? That was pretty impressive, standing up to Brunt the way you did. I knew it all along. No. Well, you surprised a lot of people, including me. I've got to get ready. I'm having dinner with Julian. And almost as brave as you are. (Leeta kisses Rom's forehead and goes into her quarters. Quark appears from around the corner.) Why don't you try your luck at dabo wheel? Remember, every Bajoran gets one free spin. I just got a raise.
I think you need someone to talk to, someone to pamper you. I'd like to meet this person. Are you crazy? I'm not going to sign this. Because a marriage is about sharing everything, including money. We're not on Ferenginar. And I'm not. That's a stupid rule. Like who? Rom, I love you, not your latinum. Never. You bet it is. [Ishka's house] (After dinner.) I hate him. All he loves is latinum. Cancelling that wedding was the best thing that ever happened to me. I am so glad he's out of my life. Major, you haven't been listening to me. What flavour? Then what do you want, Rom? I'm not signing that waiver. I don't understand. Oh, Rom. You did that for me? That's all we need. That and my salary from Quark's. (They kiss.) [Promenade - upper level] (Watching the happy reunion.)
Our jobs. Okay. (The dabo ladies march over to the bar.) We don't think we should have to give you twenty percent of our tips. We think ten percent is more than fair and we're not going back to work until this is settled. Well? He's going to think about it! [Quark's storeroom] (It's a bad line, lots of static and some words dropping out.) That's a little indulgent, don't you think? They're here! (Zek, Ishka and Maihar'du enter.) Oh, Rom!
Neither have I.
I don't know. What do you think? Rom, it's two handkerchiefs and a loincloth. Ferengi tradition or no Ferengi tradition, I am not going to be naked at my wedding. Please show us something else. I liked number thirty eight. It was elegant. Sixty four? There he is. Let's talk to him. Now, Rom. [Promenade - upper level] Captain, can we speak to you for a moment? It would be a great honour to be married by the Emissary. Thank you, Nog. Oh, Rom! You mean, we're leaving? But what about you? Then I'm not going either.
(at the dabo table) Okay, that's twelve spins and not a single dabo so far. The pot is growing and someone's going to be a big winner. (We pull away as she gives a little wave to Rom at the bar.) Hi, Rom. (She stands close, knees slightly bent so they can look straight into each others eyes better.) I must be doing something wrong. Well, I know he likes me. I have brains. Dabo! So, is that all? (Louis is gazing into Leeta's eyes) You want a real game, try dom-jot. If I ran this place, we'd have three dom-jot tables and two prayko alleys. And I'd make sure the customers had a lot more fun. Quark is a lot of things, but he's not fun. I'm fun. For a dabo girl. Thank you. All right. Will you excuse me? What is it, Rom? Oh. Sure. That would be fine. Thanks. [Captain's office] It's never a bad time for flowers. Come on in. Could you find a place for those while I change? By the way, if you're trying to impress me, you've succeeded. Really. Me? My own cafe? (she's naked) Oh. Sorry. Really? (dressed) But I've never run a restaurant or any kind of business. I barely even know how to tend bar. But where would I stay? I don't even know anybody there. But Louis, I just met you. I mean, I like you I need to think about that. I haven't made up my mind yet. I mean, this could be a big opportunity, but that's no reason to rush into anything. What do you think I should do? If I had a reason to stay, I'd stay. Do I have a reason to stay? Well, I guess I'd better take the job. Is that all you can say? You don't know. Thanks. Rom. You've been a big help. What is that? Why not? I love you too, Rom. (they kiss) Oh. Doctor, I'm sorry. You're a sweet, wonderful, and brilliant man. There's someone out there for you, Doctor. I know it. Bye.
You'll be fine. But maybe I shouldn't be there when he arrives. Well, when he was in the hospital, he didn't answer any of my letters. That's okay. I'm only his stepmother. But he's going through something so personal maybe he only wants his real family around. Here he comes. Nog! (Nog is using a walking stick, and limping. He gets a round of applause.) Welcome home, Nog. Or that ridiculous secret agent programme. Oh, Nog! So, how are you? Well, Rom got a promotion. Actually, Chief O'Brien threw him a party last night. It was a spur of the moment thing. No invitations or anything. Bye. (At the bar.) And he's stopped limping. No. He's a new man. You should go see him. Are you okay?
Hi. Jake told us about the game against the Vulcans. It sounds really exciting. Actually we were thinking of doing more than watching. We want to try out. And I decided to make it a complete family outing. Isn't it? Shows how much you know. You don't kick the ball. Do you? (Ezri signs no.) You know why? Jake said it's a game that takes heart, and you sold yours a long time ago. Come on, Rom. (Leeta and Rom leave.) What's he doing here? Oh. You can do it! He doesn't hate you, Rom. Oh, that goes for me too. Rom, there are moments when I know exactly why I married you. [Promenade] Hey, batter, batter, batter, batter. Grab it, Ezri. (Ezri gets the ball just before it clears the fence, doing a somersault.) You can do it. You can do it. Come on, Rom. It's okay, Rom.
