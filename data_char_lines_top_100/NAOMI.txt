 How does this sound? The Weird Planet Where Time Moved Very Fast And So Did The People Who Lived There, by Naomi Wildman. That's what I'm calling my report for astronomy class. Neelix said I should choose a planet to write about, so I picked this one. The Weird Planet. Perfect. What's happening? That'll be great for my report. Is the planet okay? Seven, do you think we'll ever be able to leave? I hope so. I need a way to end my report. [Space ship]
Did you have a good trip? You look tired. Seven of Nine assigned me a special project. I'm supposed to build a tetragon but I have to use everyday things. I'm not allowed to use a replicator. I was thinking about using some vegetables from the airponics bay. Carrots and celery? Neelix? Will you help me? Tonight? Then why don't I help you? What's cooking? (she touches a hot pan lid) Ouch! I'm okay. I'm fine. What? Neelix, please.
It's me, Tuvok. Naomi Wildman.(He follows her to -) [Cargo Bay two - 2371] (Tuvok sees Seven and the children in their alcoves)
I like your braid. Green. Grid three thirteen. (The twins look at each other for a few moments.) They're cheating.
Actually, I just found two pieces that fit together. I thought the point was to finish the puzzle. If you really want to help, find me a green piece that looks like Tuvok's ear. (Chakotay enters.) Captain.
That's okay. I'm tired, too. I don't like them. I just don't. They're not my friends. No. Nothing. I don't like them and I don't want to play with them. They called you names. They said everybody from your planet was stupid. They said your ears were funny. They said just looking at you made them laugh. They said I don't want to play with them. Okay.
 If you go looking for deuterium tomorrow, can I come? But this is my first away mission and I didn't get to do anything. Well, can't we make first contact with somebody, or get in a space battle? Can I? One quarter impulse, aye. Yes, sir. [Corridor] I'm hiding. Everyone. They're all acting strange. Even Mom. She keeps smiling all the time, talking about Earth like it's the greatest place in the universe. Voyager's my home. If we go to Earth, I'll have to leave the ship. I'd miss my room, Neelix. You and I wouldn't be able to play Kadis-kot anymore. Affected by what? Yes. It's just a scrape. Unconscious, sort of. Do wormholes do that? But I can help. My mom says two heads are better than one. Isn't that the Borg philosophy too? Please, I don't want to be alone. [Corridor]  Neelix! Oh, Neelix. Neelix. So where are we? [Astrometrics lab] Is it a lifeform? What are you doing? Somebody else is stuck here? He? Ow! Like a pitcher plant. The Doctor taught me about it in botany class. It catches insects by mimicking pheromones. How do we get out of the monster? The monster ate his ship, too. She's asleep. Are we still inside the monster? Would that make Voyager taste bad? Don't worry. My presence here is authorised. Mom. She thinks I need to learn more about Earth. Not really. But my mom likes it, and even Neelix can't wait to get there, so I guess it can't be that bad.
Good. Check the replicator. Okay. In there. (A storage box.) There. (The bed.) Can you stay longer? I'm afraid to go to sleep. No. What? What's that? Really? Do you think those people watch over me too? All right. Night, Neelix. [Cargo Bay two] My bed. Scared you! Can you stay longer? I want to hear about the Great Forest again. The special place. The place you think about when you can't sleep. Please. And all the people who ever loved me. I had a dream about the Great Forest last night. There was trees and grass and animals, and I saw you and Mommy and we were all happy. It was beautiful. [Mess hall]  You know what you have to do. [Vision Quest - Mess hall] He says goodnight. (Neelix tucks the fluffy toy in bed with Naomi.) Goodnight. Mummy says you were sick. Did a monster get you?
Wake up. Naomi. You know what I think? I think you're scared of the tree monster. (A fountain appears, and solidifies into a blue person with scales on his body.) Sorry I woke you, but we have a mission. I never heard that. But Flotter, logs float. It's him! Naomi Wildman, but my friends call me Naomi. I'm human. In space. I'm an explorer. Well, you know, space battles with aliens, strange anomalies. Well, I'll have to ask my mom. Maybe we jumped to conclusions about him. Excuse me! It sounds like you two need each other. I mean, think about it. Flotter, your water helps his trees grow, and Trevis, your branches shade his pond from the sun. It's a well-known fact that the sun makes water evaporate. Now, shake hands and make up. (They do. Neither likes the feel of the other's skin.)  TREVIS: Urgh. Moist palms. FLOTTER: Urgh, sappy fingers.NEELIX [OC]: Neelix to Holodeck two. Naomi here. Can't I stay a little longer?  Mom! Computer, end programme. [Wildman's Quarters] WILDMAN Grouchy as ever, but we made a new friend today named Trevis. I'll introduce him to you tomorrow as soon as you get home. (The signal is not good.) Days? All right.  I was thinking. It's time I carried my weight around here. I was thinking more of the bridge. Would I get to fly the ship? Neelix, don't move. The Borg lady. Seven of Nine, tertiary adjunct of Unimatrix zero one. Don't look! She'll assimilate you. I don't want to be in her Collective. No. I mean, yes. You can't sit here. Somebody else is sitting here. I am Borg. Can we go to the holodeck first? I want to play another Flotter story. I don't like Sickbay. It's full of creepy things. Alien organs and hyposprays. And the Doctor talks too much. Can't you reprogramme him or something? The mitochondria? Mitochondria. The warp core of the cell. What do you mean? They became friends? Friends. My mom says cooperation is more important than competition. She was supposed to call me today. Can we try to call her? (Neelix enters.) Good. Flotter!  (Naomi runs for the door.) Oh. Thank you, Doctor.  In the blink of an eye there was Trevis above us. He turned out to be very nice. His bark was worse than his bite. You. Neelix, did you have a favourite holodeck programme when you were growing up? Really?  Imagination. Deck six, section nine. Where are your sisters now? How long? But you haven't been on Voyager for that long. That's too bad. [Corridor]  Do your sisters ever call you like my mom does when she's on an away mission? I bet you miss them. Played that one yesterday. I promised I'd save that one for mom. It's her favourite. Yeah, that one. It's okay. I won't be scared if you're with me. [Holodeck - The Forest of Forever] Trevis, you're on fire! Stop complaining and help him. Water puts out fire. (Flotter quenches the flame with his hand.) What caused the fire? Lightning. But the sky is clear. Doesn't look like a thunderstorm. There's only one other explanation. The Ogre of Fire. Flotter!  (Moments later, the forest is charred and smoking.) No, we have to find Flotter. Hello, is anyone there? Trevis, are you all right? What about Flotter? Is he dead? Neelix? He can't be dead. Flotter! But I want to find Flotter. Thanks, but that's not really Flotter. I'm researching the evaporation of water. Well, I've been thinking. Water doesn't just disappear when it's heated. It turns into invisible gas. So, if we could get the forest to cool down enough, Flotter might re-liquefy. I miss mom. When's she coming back? Why hasn't she called? Has anybody talked to her? Starfleet regulation four seven six dash nine. All away teams must report to the bridge at least once every twenty four hours. Has something bad happened to them? Promise to wake me up if mommy calls? Even if it's oh two hundred hours? Neelix? (She points towards the Flotter doll, which she left by the desk monitor. Neelix takes it to her, to cuddle.) [Wildman's Quarters - living room] Thanks. [Corridor]  Deck one bridge. [Planetoid - cavern]  Computer, resume programme, Flotter, Trevis and the Ogre of Fire. It's okay. Is my mother dead? What happened? I saw that crater. Something was burning. You really think they might find her? How do I know you're telling me the truth this time? You were pretending that nothing was wrong. That nothing bad happened. Do you ever pretend that nothing bad happened to your family? Does it help? Don't be sad, Neelix. I'll be back, I promise. [Bridge] Castle? Come on, Neelix.
 Now it's twelve forty five. You said we'd have lunch together. How long is it going to take? Seven, you promised. I think it's even more crowded than this morning. Excuse us. Excuse us. Please, we're trying to get through to the turbolift. Excuse us. Thank you. [Mess hall] She's a Shivolian, right? Species five two one? Sorry. We just sat down. But you were in the Collective. Wasn't that like a big crowd? Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realise that. Let's go. (A man with a cross scar below one eye comes up to the table.) You okay? These are yours? Okay. (Seven leaves with the case.)NAOMI: What's your name? (Two walks away.) NAOMI: That was rude.  Seven. Seven. I heard about the drones. Did they hurt you? What do they want? Oh. Be careful. I, I don't, I mean. Yes. Is that okay? Do you think of me as family? I thought you might like some company. Because of what happened with the drones. It's a small ship. I thought maybe you might want to spend some time with family. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

It's Kataris. I've been learning all about it. The Arpasian range is known for high winds and hail. I never met my father. Are you going to stay with them?
I Please don't. I was just observing you. Well, Neelix told me that the Borg do a lot of things they do because they're trying to be perfect. And even though you're not really a drone anymore, you still try to be perfect. Don't you? Well, if I can learn to be perfect, too, then Captain Janeway will have to make me her Bridge Assistant. Not yet. Are you mad? So you'll teach me? Oh, I don't think I like the sound of that. Hi. Like what? Oh, I'm not allowed to go swimming without my mom. Love it. You're really good at this game. Sure. That's okay. I'll be pretty busy by then. Want to hear the rules of First Contact? How about the suborders of the Prime Directive? I know all forty seven of them. I didn't know you had a brother. Twelve? I only have my mom and Neelix to play with, when they're not working. A little. You get used to it. You adapt. You know, like the Borg. You do? Yes? We're playing Kadis-kot. Seven? [Engineering] Understood. I will. Consider it assimilated. Me? Great. [Turbolift]SEVEN: Kadis-kot. Instruct me how to play. I will comply. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Neelix and I thought we should make it more fun. When is Commander Tuvok making his presentation? Neelix. That's all right. I know you're busy. I just wanted to meet your friends. Hey. Thanks. Maybe Brax would like to go to the holodeck. Lieutenant Paris has a new programme. Invaders from the Ninth Dimension. Very. Neelix is right. Might be too scary for you. You don't think I could make up a story like that, do you? (Neelix enters.)  Come in. Neelix. A report on proto-humanoid cultures, for Commander Chakotay's palaeontology class. I'm almost finished. I have to get up early. You haven't done that in years. Thanks, Neelix, but I can put myself to bed. I'm not a little girl anymore. [Mess hall]
I was waiting for you. Kadis-kot, remember? Our weekly game? Redecorating isn't work. That was my next guess. Okay, you win. What do you do with a cortical processing er But Voyager isn't a Borg vessel, and you're not a drone anymore. The results of our Kadis-kot tournament? Which is going to download it into you. Can I try it sometime? Guess I'll stick to reading my lessons and listening to Neelix tell stories. Can I watch? Okay, tomorrow. (Naomi leaves. Seven steps into her augmented regeneration chamber.) [Janeway's quarters]  Seven. Where are you going? What's wrong? So? What are you talking about? Seven?  Guess who assimilated three books and ten reports in two days? That's correct. Are you taking your new alcove apart? Why? Maybe you can fix it. When?
Excuse me. Commander, permission to interrupt? Ensign Gilmore. Naomi Wildman, Captain's Assistant. I wanted to officially welcome you aboard the Starship Voyager. If you need anything, replicator rations, a tour of the lower decks, I'm your man. As you were. (Naomi leaves.)
I had a bad dream. Can I stay with you for a while? She's working in Engineering, and Neelix is on a duty shift. Please? I won't bother you. It looked just like this. In my dream. There was Borg stuff everywhere. I went on the mission. The one my Mom told me about, the Borg Sphere? But it didn't work. Everybody got assimilated. Mom said we're going to steal something. Will you be on the Sphere? Are you scared? But what if you don't? What if they make you a drone again? What's it like to be a drone? Does it hurt? Do the Borg have kids? What do they look like? Are they friendly? Resistance is futile. (A Borg node pops out of Naomi's face. A drone steps out of a regeneration chamber.) Permission to submit a proposal for your review. It's a rescue operation for Seven of Nine. Yes, ma'am. You see, if we change our long range sensors to Seven's cortical implant frequency maybe we can find her. What if we boosted our sensor range with power from the main deflector? Captain? You're not going to give up, are you? Sensor logs. You mean the Borg were talking to Seven of Nine?
Is it going to hurt? We didn't do this last year. Is something wrong with me? Does my mother have to do this? Subatomic level? I thought you said this wasn't going to hurt. Try to hold still, please. No. (A little later.)EMH: It'll only take a second to download your images into the medical database, if you'd like to stay for a moment and see what you look like from the inside out.
