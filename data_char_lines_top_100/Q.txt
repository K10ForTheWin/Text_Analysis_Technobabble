What have you done now, Q? Well, now, isn't this just fine. Humans aren't supposed to be in this quadrant for another hundred years. How did you get out, Q? Oh, well, I guess that's what we get for having a woman in the captain's seat. You know, I was betting that Riker would get this command. Have you heard about little me? Oh, do tell. Has Jean-Luc been whispering about me behind my back? Say, is this the ship of the Valkyries, or have you human women finally done away with your men altogether? A slight accident. Oh, let me guess. You were trying to commit suicide. Now you see why we've locked him up for the last three hundred years. (Q snaps his fingers and the men reappear. He peers at Chakotay's tattoo.) Facial art. Ooo, how very wilderness of you. All right, Q, we should be going. This is a joke. You would ask these puny humans to protect you from me? Fat chance. (Quinn makes Q disappear. The ship starts shaking.) Oh, I know all the hiding places, Q. I hid here from the Continuum myself once. Yes, but just think of the honour of having your DNA spread from one corner of the universe to the other. Why, you could be the origin of the humanoid form. You heard the lady, Q. Back to your cell. (Q disappears again.) Ready or not, here I am. (And vanishes again. The shaking stops.) [on viewscreen] You can't hide from me, Q. [on viewscreen] Did anyone ever tell you you're angry when you're beautiful? How would you like to spend eternity as a Gorokian midwife toad. A hearing? You would have me put his future in your delicate little hands? Oh, so touchably soft. What is your secret, dear? Well, this could go on for a millennium or two, I suppose. All right, I accept on behalf of the Continuum on one condition. If you rule in our favour, Q agrees to return to his confinement. Why? So you can kill yourself? Accepted. Well, this is going to make for an amusing diversion. Will you send him to prison for eternity or will you assist in his suicide plan? That's a toughie, but that's why they made you captain, isn't it? To handle the real tough ones? My, my. Now I guess now we get to find out whether the pants really fit. [Tuvok's office] (Quinn zaps in as Tuvok is reading a PADD.) Madam Captain, we are dealing here with an issue of the greatest importance to the Q Continuum. I assure you we take this matter very seriously. His life will follow. Emphasise life. He's putting his selfish wishes above the welfare of everyone else. You would not be confined if you were not intent on harming yourself. With your permission, Captain, I would like to call an expert on the Continuum to discuss the implications of the decision to be made. I call myself to the stand. Thank you for coming. It's a rare honour to have someone of your reputation and accomplishment with us today. Tell me, what would be the impact of a Q suicide? How would you characterise his remarks? Mentally unbalanced. And no civilised people in the universe, including the primitive Federation societies, would condone the suicide of a mentally unbalanced person. Objection. If I may beg the court's indulgence, I have other witnesses to call. Your Captain Honour, I am here to argue for the majesty of life. What it means to us to be alive. A Q's life takes him to all corners of the universe. This Q's life has touched and affected many, many others, including some on your own homeworld. With your permission, I would like to call some of those people whose lives have been changed by this Q. I promise it won't impact the timeline, and no one will remember ever having being here after I send them back. The day the apple fell on your head? Quite a day, wasn't it? As a matter of fact, this man jostled the tree when he got up to leave. And a new era in human science was born. The guy in the jeep, who picked you up after your own vehicle broke down that summer afternoon, isn't that right? You were on your way to a job, weren't you? To sum up, you were a spotlight operator at an outdoor concert of some sort. A concert that was put in jeopardy moments before it was to begin, because the entire sound system failed. Yes, lucky you were at the right place at the right time, or it would have taken days to track down the problem and there would have been no concert. Are you sure? Have you seen this photograph before? (On an easel, a sepia picture of two Civil War soldiers.) And the soldier beside him? As a matter of fact, he carried your wounded ancestor back from the front line. Didn't you? My point is, Captain, that Q has had a profound influence on these three lives. Without Q, Isaac Newton would have died forgotten in a Liverpool debtor's prison, a suspect in several prostitute murders. Without Q, there would have been no concert at, er. Wherever. More importantly, Mister Ginsberg would never have met his future wife, the groovy chick with the long red beads, and he would never have become a successful orthodontist, settled in Scarsdale with four kids. Yes. Without Q there would have been no William T. Riker at all, and I would have lost at least a dozen really good opportunities to insult him over the years. Oh, and lest I forget, without Q, the Borg would have assimilated the Federation. Thank you. Thank you. (The witnesses vanish.) This is the life Q treats without respect. This is the life that he would give up so easily. I object. We just want to give him time to reconsider his position. This is your own doing. You could live a perfectly normal life if you were simply willing to live a perfectly normal life. Yes, what is it, Captain? And you will rule in our favour. How would you know if I intended to keep my word? You've made your point. I think you've uncovered my one redeeming virtue. Am I blushing? I wish I could help you, Kathy. I just can't. We're dealing here with the most dangerous man in the Continuum. Now I didn't tell you this, but one of his self destructive stunts created a misunderstanding which ignited the hundred year war between the Romulans and the Vulcans. No, this man goes back into his confinement. But I would like to make it easier for you. The Continuum is prepared to do you a little favour, if we approve of your ruling. Look out the window. (Earth.) Now you see it. Now you don't. [Hearing room] And how do you intend to do that? No. It's a ridiculous idea. You would never understand. I suppose you have some crazy idea how to pull this off? Only if. We've agreed on a format for this little sojourn. But I still believe it's ill-advised. No, please. (Quinn does the honours.) [Desert road] I told you so. Oh, we've all done the scarecrow. Big deal. Of course not. They're happy people. Happy people. What's there to feel sad about? Look at them. Oh, the philosopher speaks. Well, I don't know about you, but I appreciate a little peace and quiet now and again. I don't know what you mean. I believe in the ultimate purity of the Q. My penance has ended. I'm a born again Q. That life is behind me. It did? I did? And I paid the price for my inappropriate behaviour. That's when he lost his mind and started trying to destroy himself. We had no choice but to confine him but for his own safety. Trouble sleeping? Did you ever try warm Kylerian goat's milk? (Janeway leaps out of bed and puts on her dressing gown.) Did you think about our offer? Merely an incentive to make the proper decision. No, I told them it wouldn't. That's why I talked them into giving you what you asked for. You have my word. He won't go back to the cell. We'll assign someone to look after him. Whatever it takes. It's what you wanted, isn't it? So, you've won. Let's celebrate. Just you and me. The two of us. I'll take you home. Before you know it, you'll be scampering across the meadow with your little puppies, the grass beneath your bare feet. A man, coming over the hill way in the distance, waves to you. You run to be in his arms and as you get closer you see that it's me. Forget Mark. I know how to show a girl a good time. How would you like a ticker-tape parade down Sri Lanka Boulevard? The captain who brought Voyager back. A celebrated hero. I never did anything like that for Jean-Luc. But I feel very close to you. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because you have such authority and yet manage to preserve your femininity so well. We'll talk about this after the hearing tomorrow. [Hearing room] May I see you in your chambers, Captain? A sidebar, your honour. Only for a moment. Well, so much for ticker-tape parades. I got it for him. Illogical, Tuvok? 1 don't think so. By demanding to end his life, he taught me a little something about my own. He was right when he said the Continuum scared me back in line. I didn't have his courage or his convictions. He called me irrepressible. This was a man who was truly irrepressible. I only hope I make a worthy student. I certainly hope not. Au revoir, Madam Captain. We will meet again. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

There's no need to call room service, Kathy. I've already ordered. (He is wearing a red silk dressing gown.) You did say you wanted champagne? Oh, it's no use. I've taken the proverbial phone off the hook. After all, we don't want any interruptions. To us. The night is young, and the sheets are satin. I have no intention of getting between those Starfleet issue sheets. They give me a terrible rash. Oh, Kathy, don't be such a prude. Admit it. It has been a while. So tense. Why don't you slip into something more comfortable? (Flash, and she is in a silk nightdress.) Now I see. You think I'm interested in some tawdry one night stand. That's because I haven't told you why I'm here yet. Out of all the females of all the species in all the galaxies, I have chosen you to be the mother of my child. I know that you're probably asking yourself, why would a brilliant, handsome, dashingly omnipotent being like Q want to mate with a scrawny little bipedal specimen like me? Nonsense. I could have chosen a Klingon Targ, the Romulan empress, a Cyrillian microbe. (Janeway puts on a dressing gown.) It's an overwhelming honour, isn't it? I can't get you out of my mind. You're confident, passionate, beautiful. Kathy, you can't leave. My cosmic clock is ticking. Besides, you have no idea what you're missing. Foreplay with a Q can last for decades. Oh, I see, this is one of those silly human rituals. You're playing hard to get. Goody! A challenge. This is going to be fun. (Q disappears, and so does the awful bed.) I do believe you're jealous. (to Janeway) Why didn't you tell me there was another man? (Q is in Starfleet uniform.) I was wondering, Kathy. What could anyone possibly see in this big oaf, anyway? Is it the tattoo? Because mine's bigger. (And covers the left half of his face.) Nice programme, Tommy. But it's all just so much holo-pleasure, isn't it? Guys, I just don't understand your Captain. I've tried everything. Filling the Bridge with roses, writing Drabian love sonnets, serenading her in her bath. But no matter what lengths I go to win her heart, she rejects me. Me! How, I ask you, is that possible? No. I just thought that the two of you might be able to give me some advice on how to break through Kathy's icy exterior. You know, man to man. You, bar rodent, another one of these fruity concoctions. Captain Janeway? Now that's a subject I want to discuss. Tell me, what are some of her favourite things. Chocolate truffles? Stuffed animals? Erotic art? Oh, no? Isn't that what you do? I understand that you acquire things for her, create little interesting diversions, prepare little tasty treats. After all, why else would she be so fond of your fur-lined face? How can you ignore that face? Please, accept him as a small token of my affection. Suit yourself. May we talk? Just talk. (Q sits on the bench below the windows, cradling the puppy. Janeway reluctantly joins him.) I'm afraid that I haven't been sincere. When you first asked why I wanted to have a child with you, I made jokes, bragged about my prowess, engaged in sexual innuendo. I was using all that to cover up my true feelings. I'm lonely. Oh, I know it's hard to believe, but I've been single for billions of years. It was fun at first, gallivanting around the galaxy, using my omnipotence to impress females of every species. The fact of the matter is, it left me empty. I want someone to love me for myself. I guess what I'm saying is, I want a relationship. I just thought if you and I had a child, it would give me that kind of stability and security that I've been missing. Oh. All right. Let's see if you buy this. You're stuck out here, thousands of light years from home, and you aren't getting any younger, are you? All your hopes for home, hearth and family grow dimmer every day. Admit it, Kathryn, you're lonely too. And you wonder if you will ever have a child. Why not? Q! How did you find me? Can't you see I'm busy here? Stop stalking me. Kathryn Janeway, may I present Q. We were involved for a while. I never said it was exclusive. Oh! Now you see what you've done? And I was finally making progress. Will you stop overreacting? Always nagging. Now you see why I left her. Well, not exactly. Well, if you insist. (Q snaps his fingers, and he and Janeway disappear.) Well, I must admit, your gown is very becoming. This is no fantasy. You're in the Q Continuum. That's right. I'm simply allowing you to perceive it in the context your human mind can comprehend. It was awfully drab, wasn't it? But this, this is a much more colourful representation for a human of American descent, don't you think? An elegant manor house, a beautiful Southern belle, a dashing Union officer determined to win her affections despite her hatred for Yankee interlopers. Well, I'm sure your first officer, Chuckles, is it? I'm sure he's got everything under control for the moment. This has gone way beyond your ship. It's even gone beyond you and me. This is about the future of the Continuum itself. I'll do better than that. I'll show you. (He opens the shutters on the French windows. Fires burn in the distance, and there is the sound of cannonfire.) The Continuum is burning. The Q are in the middle of a civil war. Do you remember our friend, Quinn? Do you recall what I said might happen if he were allowed to take his own life? I'd say a civil war is pretty dire, wouldn't you? It caused chaos and upheaval. Because even though he was gone, his calls for freedom and individualism continued to echo in the ears of those who believed in his teachings, myself among them. I sounded the trumpet and carried the banner. Naturally, others followed. The forces of the status quo tried to crush us once and for all, but we fought back. And now there's a cosmic struggle for supremacy, and the battle is spreading, causing hazardous repercussions throughout the galaxy. You might call them galactic cross fire. It's terrible, isn't it? But it's also a wonderful opportunity. War can be an engine of change. War can transform a society for the better. Your own Civil War brought about an end to slavery and oppression. That's where you come in. I want you to help me transform the Continuum in the same way your Civil War transformed a nation. I know. It's brilliant, isn't it? It's simple. Mating will create a new breed of Q, which will combine my omnipotence and infinite intellect with the best that humanity has to offer. Precisely. What the Continuum needs right now is an infusion of fresh blood, a new sensibility, a new leader, a new messiah. Think of it, Kathy. Our child will be like a precious stone tossed into the cosmic lake, sending endless ripples of human conscience and compassion to wash up on every distant shore of the universe. What greater contribution could a being of your limited power ever hope to make? What is more important to humanity than peace? I'm offering you the opportunity to be the mother of peace. (Gunshots break the window glass. Q pulls Janeway to safety on the floor.) Well, what's it going to be? Oh! Ow! That hurts. As I said, this is only a perception of what is happening. I can assure you, those are not mere cannonballs and lead charges being fired at us. You'd be surprised what innovative munitions can be created by one immortal being who's set his mind on killing another. I’ll never surrender! You know that! (He shoots at the people outside.) Get the rifle in the corner and take the other window. If that's how you feel about it. But if their weapons can make me bleed, what do you think they'll do to you? (A cannonball lands, knocking Q down.) Well? Where are we? How? You saved my life. I knew you'd come around. Oh, my wild, sweet Kathy. I promise you won't regret it. Mate with another Q? Ridiculous. Yes, but it was never physical. I mean, the Q are way beyond sex. It's never been done. The Q didn't come into existence. The Q have always existed. Besides, I can only mate with a species capable of copulation, like you. Yes, but what does that have to do with it? Dearest Kathy, I would never dream of having you give it up. I mean, who would raise it? Who would look after it? I'm really not cut out to be a wet nurse. I'm an idea man. Hard work isn't my forte. Why not? Ow. Yes, but that's exactly why I want you here, to nourish and guide the little tyke. Think of the opportunities here in the Continuum. The entire universe would be our child's playground. Together the two of you could explore dimensions you've never even imagined. Fess up. Isn't it even slightly tempting? Ah, yes. The crew of the intrepid starship Voyager. Perhaps you'd be interested in sending them home. Even if I wanted to mate, I wouldn't know how. It's totally unprecedented. I need time to think about it. Kathy, don't be a hero. Then remodulate the shields to emit a beta-tachyon pulse and prepare to emit a series of focused antiproton beams to the shield bubble. Ah, Captain Janeway, I presume. (to guard) You're dismissed. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, madam, but, please sit down. I understand you walked into our camp alone and unarmed? She's right. I've had a change of heart. If it's any consolation, there are those in the Continuum who will remember us as martyrs. Still, you have to admit, there's something romantic about going to our deaths together. Today I sacrifice my existence for the principles of freedom and individuality that I have fought for so long. But this woman is innocent. What's more, she saved my life, and she tried to save us from each other. Kill me if you must, but let her go. I'm sorry. I'm hit! I'm dying! Oh! (Janeway looks down at herself, then sees the squad taking up defensive positions.) What? They're not? (There are familiar faces amongst the boys in blue.) (to Female Q) Oh, darling, I knew you'd come for me. Aren't you going to untie me? Well, it just so happens I have a proposal which will reassure you of my devotion. (Kim and Janeway move away. Sergeant Paris has made his way around the rear of the Confederates.) Think of it, Q. We'd be visionaries, innovators, the parents of peace. So, darling, have you given any thought as to how we might accomplish this historic act of procreation? Oh! Oh. Oh. Oh! I love it when you talk dirty. Oh, Kathy, don't you like to watch? (The two Qs touch right forefingers, which glow briefly.) Oh! I was good, wasn't I? You had your chance. Don't go crying about it now. (Snaps fingers.)  [Bridge]  Yabba dabba doo. (Q is dandling a toddler in uniform on his knee.) He's got my cheekbones, don't you think? Well, I'll admit, I look at the universe in an entirely different way now. I mean, I can't go around causing temporal anomalies or subspace inversions without considering the impact it'll have on my son. By the way, did I tell you how smart he is? I've already taught him how to knock small planets out of orbit. Oh, that's why we want Auntie Kathy to be the godmother now, don't we? Yeah, well, wait until we ask you to baby-sit. Can't leave the little guy alone for a nanosecond. Well, it's time to be going. The old ball and chain really hates it when we're late. (to Baby Q) Say bye bye. Bye bye.  <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.
