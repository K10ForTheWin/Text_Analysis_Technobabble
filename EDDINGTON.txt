I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
I've posted two security officers at the Defiant's docking port, sir. No one'll get near the cloaking device without us knowing about it. Well, I am here to make friends. I'm Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, Starfleet Security. All right, what's going on here? Easy, Doctor. We're all friends here. I'll see this doesn't happen again. Our orders are to give the Jem'Hadar a wide berth. I'm aware of station regulations, Doctor. However, the Jem'Hadar are not. We have to allow them some time to get used to our customs. Remember that before you get into another brawl with them. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinnertime) Can I help you? Sorry, my orders are no one sees him. You'll have to talk to Admiral Nechayev. She's in charge here until the Jem'Hadar Odo's message said the runabout had been caught in a tractor beam. That suggests he was captured and taken aboard one of their ships. Yes, sir. A task force of nine starships is due to arrive tomorrow. Sir, Admiral Toddman's orders were quite clear and The Security detachment is aboard and phaser rifles have been issued to every fire team. This isn't the result of a spatial anomaly, Major. The tetryon compositor on the cloaking device has been sabotaged. Because I sabotaged it. I was under orders from Admiral Toddman to stop you from pursuing the Romulan-Cardassian fleet. We can still defend ourselves. I didn't damage any of the ship's weapon systems or the engines. But without the cloak, we'll have to return to DS Nine. I'm sorry Commander, I didn't want to do this. Odo's my friend too but I report directly to Admiral Toddman and he gave me an explicit order. I couldn't disobey it. Sir, if we run into the Jem'Hadar, you're still going to need a chief security officer. Because I give you my word. Four more Jem'Hadar ships closing to starboard. Shields at eighty percent. Well, as someone who is obsessed with rank and title, congratulations, Captain. Captain on the bridge. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. I'll see to it that if hostilities do occur, the Ambassador is escorted off the bridge. I won't let that bother me. Captain, I just want to say that I agree with what Chief O'Brien said. About your promotion. It's about time. You'd be surprised. People don't enter Starfleet to become commanders, or admirals for that matter. It's the captain's chair that everyone has their eye on. That's what I wanted when I joined up, but you don't get to be a Captain wearing a gold uniform. Then who would protect the Ambassador? Thank you, sir. Captain's log, stardate 48962.5. We are twelve hours from the border. I haven't been in this area since the last Federation-Tzenkethi war. Being here brings back a lot of memories, most of them bad. [Bridge] With your permission, Captain, the Constable and I can begin questioning the crew immediately. You realise, of course, that if no one else tests positive Yes, sir. (Odo and Eddington leave) Our security teams have gone over every centimetre of the ship, checked every piece of cargo, questioned every crewmember. We still haven't been able to find the changeling. At warp? It's unlikely. But with Dominion technology, I suppose it's possible. Which means he was probably replaced before we left the station. I wish the internal sensors were online. It'd make it a lot easier to track down the changeling. That won't be easy. Let's face it, no matter how many precautions we take, he could replace any one of us and we won't know it until it's too late. [Corridor] (Three crew members are escorted into a cabin. Keep your phasers on stun. And stay calm. I don't want anyone getting nervous and shooting one of us by mistake. You sure I can't interest you in one of these? Apparently that changeling doesn't feel the same way. If we don't stop him, no one on board will escape unharmed. Including you. We've reconfigured the rifles to fire an expanding energy pulse. Don't you ever sweat? You know, this'd be a lot easier if we knew where he was hiding. Where would you be if you were him? He is one of your people. Can't you put yourself in his position, try to anticipate his next move? That's too bad. For all of us. [Jefferies tube ladder] (comes in behind Kira) What happened? What are you getting at? Let's get this over with. (Bashir takes the sample, and we're shown it morphing into goo. But he had two vials in his hand when he unplugged it from the hypo, so?) This is ridiculous. I'm not the changeling. If I were, don't you think I'd put up a little more of a fight? You're making a mistake. Sensors aren't picking up any warp signatures. Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax? Weapons are fully charged and ready to fire. Tactical systems are programming an attack run on the Tzenkethi settlement. [Engine room] The phaser banks are powering down. Starfleet Security believes he's been kidnapped or possibly killed. How long will we have to keep generating the matrix? We're ready, Commander. Eddington to Bridge. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. Aye, sir. Acknowledged. [Bridge] It's out of control. We can't put it out with those. We'll have to vent the entire compartment out into space. There's no way to get to her. Not long with that plasma fire. Ten, twenty seconds at most. Dax, if we don't contain this thing now, it's going to set off the warp core. I'll try to keep the field stable as long as I can. (A forcefield comes on over the top of the fire. Dax walks down the hot slope to the lower deck and gets to Lenara just before it gives out. The alarm sounds and Eddington evacuates the upper level as the blast door comes down. Dax gets Lenara and helps her into a nearby Jefferies tube.) [Jefferies tube] Welcome back, Captain. [Ops] You're cleared to set down on landing pad three. How was the conference? [Runabout Orinoco] I can imagine. [Ops] There's some message traffic from Starfleet Command for you to look at [Runabout Orinoco] But nothing Orinoco, cut your impulse engines and drop your deflectors. We're going to try to beam you out of there. [Runabout Orinoco] I've locked on. Energising. (Sisko, Kira, O'Brien, Worf, and Dax are just beaming in when KaBOOM! goes the Orinoco and BANG goes the transporter pad. Red alert goes off. Eddington goes down into the pit.) Captain Sisko's runabout exploded while I was trying to beam them back. Some of the energy travelled back along the transporter beam and blew up the primary energising coils. Yes. They're in the buffer. But the patterns will start to degrade if not used immediately. We need to store the patterns somewhere. I don't think we have any choice. Computer, I need to store all data currently in the transporter pattern buffer. Where can I save it? Computer, what if we wiped all computer memory in every system on the station and then stored the patterns? Computer, this is a command priority override. Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer. Authorisation Eddington zero six five alpha enable. I think so, but I'm not sure where. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] (Mona helps Garak into a casual jacket over a polo neck jumper.) Odo, wait. Doctor, where are you? And do you have access to a working computer console? The programme is still running? [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Stay where you are [Ops] Doctor. Keep the programme running for now. We'll get right back to you. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Ops to Bashir. [Ops] Doctor, whatever you do, don't end that programme. [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] There's been a transporter accident. [Ops] We believe the holosuite memory core is holding the transporter patterns of five crewmembers. If you stop the programme, their patterns [Holosuite - Bashir's apartment] Might be lost. It's a long story. [Ops] But at this moment the patterns of Captain Sisko, Kira, Worf, Dax and O'Brien exist only in the holosuite database. A few? It's like a junkyard in here. Where's the core memory interface? The spatula? I've found them. All five of their physical patterns are in here and they're stable. The holosuite is specifically designed to store highly complex energy patterns. The computer's processing their physical patterns as if they were holosuite characters. Trouble is, I'm not reading any neural energy. Ever heard of them before? From what we can tell, Quark was right. The computer has stored the neural energy patterns of everyone on the runabout throughout the entire station. I say we use the Defiant. Its power systems and computers are independent of the station and it has its own transporter. Except what? Is all this really necessary? How long until we're ready to try retrieving their patterns? O'Brien's going to kill me when he gets back. [Holosuite - Cavern] (Garak and Bashir are fastened to the support struts of a laser.) Eddington to Bashir. We're going to try rematerialising their patterns in about two minutes. It's going to take some explaining. Eddington to Bashir. We've got them, Doctor. You can leave [Holosuite - Sitting room] (Only Everest is above sea level on the map.) The holosuite now. This briefing will contain information considered extremely sensitive by Starfleet Command. Please, do not share it with anyone who doesn't have a level seven security rating. It seems that during their recent invasion of Cardassia, the Klingons inflicted far more damage than we've been led to believe. Two weeks ago, the civilian government on Cardassia Prime secretly contacted the Federation Council and made an urgent request for industrial replicators. And that request has been granted. Twelve, all class four. With all due respect, Bajor is just one planet. The Klingons have destroyed the industrial base of literally dozens of Cardassian worlds. With twelve CFI replicators, they can at least start building new power plants and factories. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Maquis may try to stop the shipment or even seize the replicators for themselves. Intelligence also reports that the Demilitarised zone between Cardassia and the Federation has become a hotbed of increasing terrorist activity in the past month. We suspect the Maquis have built several new bases in the Badlands, and the Cardassians in the DMZ are getting worried. Yes, sir. In three days. Aye, sir. Captain, it's come to our attention that there may be a Maquis smuggler here on the station. Again, we're still not certain. There's more. Starfleet Intelligence has infiltrated one of the Maquis cells and obtained a partial list of their contacts in the Bajoran Sector. They all had cover names, of course, but one of their contacts started living aboard Deep Space Nine in the last six months. If she's really a Maquis, then she's no longer a Federation citizen. Understood, sir. (Odo and Eddington head for the door.) Not if they're going to search for contraband while they make it look like a health inspection. They need time to look for camouflage fields, false cargo manifests, computer records. Captain, I strongly recommend that we at least try. No, sir. Aye, sir. What are our orders if we observe Captain Yates meeting a Maquis ship? Perfectly. [Bridge] (Cloaked) The Badlands. I don't have any feelings about them one way or the other. I do my job, Chief. Starfleet says to find the Maquis, I'll find the Maquis. They tell me to help them, I'll help them. My opinion is irrelevant. What matters to me is doing my job like a Starfleet officer. Anything else is an indulgence. And the Xhosa's beaming over her cargo. [Garak's shop] After the cargo was beamed aboard the Maquis raider, the Xhosa took this route out of the Badlands and resumed its course to Dreon Seven. For all we know, the Xhosa may not make another run for months. We shouldn't let this opportunity pass us by. Yes, sir. And that does bring up another point I'd like to discuss. In private, if I may. (Odo leaves) Sir, the CFI replicators are due to arrive here tomorrow afternoon. I'd feel better if I were here to supervise the security detail. Yes, sir, he can, but Sir, if the Maquis put up a fight the Xhosa might get caught in the crossfire. If that happens, I can't guarantee the safety of Kasidy Yates. And to be blunt, I don't want that responsibility. Thank you, Captain. [Cargo bay] I've received new orders from Starfleet Command. The CFI replicators in cargo bay seventeen are to be transferred aboard a Vulcan freighter which should arrive at any moment. This operation is to be carried out in complete secrecy. No one aboard the station is to know about it. Absolutely. Also, as of this moment, we're observing communications silence. No comm. traffic in or out of the station for the next nine hours. Understood? Dismissed. (Security leave, Kira enters.) Yes, Major. I'm afraid I need to take command of the station for the next few hours. (And he shoots her, then locks the wardroom behind him.) [Bridge] Very good. We'll be departing in five minutes and I'm leaving you in command until Captain Sisko returns. You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? If you're not up to the job, I'll find someone else who is. The safety of this station may depend on you and I need to know if you can handle it. Good. Now go to Ops and take command. Captain. Will knowing my personal motivation change anything at this point? Then let's table that for now. The only reason I've contacted you is to ask you to leave us alone. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not the Federation. Leave us alone and I can promise you you'll never hear from the Maquis again. You keep sending replicators to Cardassia and you're going to have a lot more to worry about than hijackings. I know you. I was like you once, but then I opened my eyes. Open your eyes, Captain. Why is the Federation so obsessed about the Maquis? We've never harmed you, and yet we're constantly arrested and charged with terrorism. Starships chase us through the Badlands and our supporters are harassed and ridiculed. Why? Because we've left the Federation, and that's the one thing you can't accept. Nobody leaves paradise. Everyone should want to be in the Federation. Hell, you even want the Cardassians to join. You're only sending them replicators because one day they can take their rightful place on the Federation Council. You know, in some ways you're worse than the Borg. At least they tell you about their plans for assimilation. You're more insidious. You assimilate people and they don't even know it. Throw it on the ground. Turn around. Hello, Captain. Mister Cing'ta won't be joining us. His shuttle had an accident on the way to this rendezvous. You just don't understand the Maquis, do you, Captain? We're not killers. Mister Cing'ta's accident has marooned him on a particularly nasty planet in the Badlands, but I assure you he's very much alive. It's more than he deserved. He was going to sell us out to you. He betrayed us. You've been on my tail for eight months and now that we're face-to-face that's all you have to say to me? Tell me, Captain. What is it that bothers you more? The fact that I left Starfleet to fight for a higher cause, or the fact that it happened on your watch? Look out there. (Sisko looks out into the main cave again.) Those people, They were colonists on Salva Two. They had farms, and shops, and homes, and schools, and then one day the Federation signed a treaty and handed their world over to the Cardassians. Just like that. They made these people refugees overnight. They don't want to be resettled. They want to go home to the lives they built. How would you feel if the Federation gave your father's home to the Cardassians? I didn't tell you to turn around. Look at them, Captain. They're humans, just like you and me, and Starfleet took everything away from them. Remember that the next time you put on that uniform. There's a war out there and you're on the wrong side. Someday I may take you up on that. For now, let me leave you with one piece of advice. Don't come after me. You'll regret it. (Eddington beams out, and Sisko taps his comm. badge.) Before you waste a lot of time running around trying to restore computer control, let me save you some trouble. You can't. You'll find that your memory cores are completely wiped and will have to be reprogrammed from scratch. These work remarkably well. Glad we were able to procure one. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But I assure you, it took a great deal of time to devise one that wouldn't be detected by Odo or Chief O'Brien. I'm really quite proud of it. Well, as long as you're making a list, why don't you add this. (And the raider attacks. BOOM, BANG) You know what your problem is, Captain? You've made this personal. It didn't have to be. It wasn't with me. I have no animosity, no harsh feelings toward you. Does it really pay to risk yourself, your ship, your crew, on a personal vendetta? And would Starfleet approve? I'm the one in control here, Captain. Your ship is defenceless. I could destroy you right now, but I won't. Like I said, the Maquis aren't killers. Our quarrel is with the Cardassians, not you. Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone. Cease fire. No. I'm not going to make you grovel for your life. Unlike you, Captain, I know when to walk away. Maybe you should think about that on your long trip home. Captain's log, stardate 50488.2. The Defiant has returned to the station, but not under its own power. The starship Malinche had to tow us home. [Ops] (hologram) You just couldn't resist the temptation to come after me, could you, Captain. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, again. You won't get me, Captain. But I do have a consolation prize for you. Actually it's more of a gift. It's a book. One of my favourites. Les Miserables. Recently? If not, you should read it again. Pay close attention to the character of Inspector Javert, the French policeman who spends twenty years chasing a man for stealing a loaf of bread. Sound like anyone you know? It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans. Enjoy the book. (Transmission ends) (hologram) Well, Javert, let's see how deep your obsession with me is. You've got me. I can't outrun or outfight the Defiant. But, if you come after me you'll have to pay a price. You'll have to let all those helpless Cardassians spiral down to their deaths. The choice is yours. Not much time. Probably take you at least a minute to get back to the planet. They're just Cardassians. (hologram) What are you really up to, Javert? Do you expect me to believe that a decorated Starfleet officer, the pride of the service, is going to poison an entire planet? You're bluffing. Do you realise what you've done? You're talking about turning hundreds of thousands of people into homeless refugees. But think about those people you saw in the caves, huddled and starving. They didn't attack the Malinche. Can't you see what's happening to you? You're going against everything you claim to believe in, and for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta? And you're betraying yours right now! The sad part is, you don't even realise it. I feel sorry for you, Captain. This obsession with me, look what it's cost you. Wait! If you call off your attack I'll turn over all our biogenic weapons. All right, Javert. I'll give you what you want. Me. (Transmission ends) Captain's log, supplemental. Resettlement efforts in the DMZ are underway. The Cardassian and Maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated. The balance in the region will be restored, though the situation remains far from stable. [Airlock] I'm dreaming, right? This is a nightmare. I was wondering when you'd show up. I expected to see you here weeks ago. But now you're here. So enjoy yourself. Savour the moment. I know you've been wanting to gloat over my defeat for a long time. You deserve to. You won. I betrayed Starfleet by joining the Maquis. You swore you'd track me down and you did. You got your revenge. One of my favourite topics. (The cell forcefield is lowered for Sisko to throw the PADD in) Why should I? It has nothing to do with me. Michael is a very common name. Guess again. If you expect me to shed a tear, you're going to be disappointed. I used up all my tears when the Dominion slaughtered the Maquis. I sat here in this cell for three days and listened to the reports as they came in. In those three days, everyone and everything I cared about was wiped out. Your generosity of spirit touches me. But you don't give a damn about what happened to us, and I don't give a damn about what happens to you. What you want and what I want doesn't really matter. There's nothing you can do to stop those missiles from hitting their targets. They're cloaked, highly manoeuvrable, programmed to change course at random. You'll never find them. Even if there was such a thing, you'd have to transmit it from the launch site. And I don't think you're going to find that either. No code, no launch site. I'm afraid you're out of luck, Captain. Looks like everyone's out of luck. That's what you do when you're in prison. Nothing. Just sit back and wait for the next counselling session, the next psychological evaluation, the next rehabilitation seminar. You like this, don't you, Ben? You like deciding the fate of others. It makes you feel important. Freedom, huh? Tell me. If they did release me, where would I go? What would I do? What about bringing the Maquis back from the dead? Can I do that? Can you? Can anyone? No, I didn't think so. In that case, I'll tell you what I want. I want to lie here until the Jem'Hadar blow this place to pieces and me along with it. [Infirmary] (Quark has an injury above his eye.) What about these? It makes it a little difficult to eat. Replicator entree number one oh three. Curried chicken and rice with a side order of carrots. Or at least that's what they want us to believe. But you and I both know what we're really eating. Replicated protein molecules and textured carbohydrates. It may look like chicken, but it still tastes like replicated protein molecules to me. Remember that Thanksgiving dinner you cooked for the senior staff last year? How many months did it take you to grow all those vegetables in the hydroponic garden? Every ingredient fresh, real. Though you did put too much tarragon in the stuffing. I wasn't, until I joined the Maquis and started eating real food. Food that I'd grown with my own hands. Fresh corn, sweet as a baby's smile. And tomatoes. Do you know how hard it is to grow tomatoes? There's always too much rain or not enough. It's too hot, it's too cold. I wonder what happened to those tomato plants? Probably burned to the ground along with everything else. You never give up, do you, Ben? Here we are, having a pleasant conversation about food, and all you're thinking about is the mission and how to get me to cooperate. You're wasting your breath. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. I'm dead. Then why didn't you leave me in prison? You're going to have to. I told you when you dragged me out of my cell that I wasn't going to help you. I meant it then and I mean it now. You're the one who set the ground rules when you came after me, Ben. You're the one who made it personal. You could've looked the other way. You could've left the Maquis alone, but you didn't do it. You hunted us, hounded us, fought us every chance you got. And in the end, you set us up for the slaughter. I expected better of you than that. So did a lot of people. People like Cal Hudson. I bet you haven't heard that name in a while. He told me the two of your were friends at the Academy. Until he joined the Maquis. If it makes you feel any better, he paid for his sins. He was killed in a skirmish with the Cardassians. He felt the same about you. He thought you were wrong about the Maquis, but he forgave you, which is ironic considering you never forgave him. You can't forgive any of us. And not because we betrayed Starfleet or the Federation, but because we betrayed you. That's what this is all about. Your ego. Where Benjamin Sisko leads, all must follow. It's the truth, isn't it? The Maquis were never much of a threat to the Federation, but we were a threat to you. We were a stain on your record and you couldn't have that. Not when you were so busy measuring yourself for an admiral's uniform. The Maquis won its greatest victories under my leadership. They died because I wasn't there when they needed me most. Because you put me in jail. We had the Cardassians on the run. Not quite the end. It's not so pointless. If you can't have victory, sometimes you just have to settle for revenge. Not quite the legacy I had in mind, but I can live with it. (waking) Are we there yet? That's the question, isn't it? I'll pass, thanks. Yeah, those are Jem'Hadar warships all right. You've got a problem. I have faith in you, Captain. You'll get us out of this. Where are you going? Now? You're crazy. They're almost on top of us. They're scanning us. Very clever, Captain, but it's not going to work. I am not going to take the helm. That is what you're trying to do, isn't it? That's an awfully big bet. I plotted a spiral course around a plasma filament. It should dissipate our warp signature. You can take over now. Let's get one thing straight, Captain. I'll get you to the launch site and I'll help you deactivate those missiles. But then you and I are going to have it out once and for all. I don't intend to fight you, Captain. I intend to kill you. (Later, and Eddington is still piloting.) Captain, when I joined the Maquis, I left some personal items behind on the station. You didn't happen to see an old Earth coin, about this big with a bird on the front? A loon, actually. My lucky looney. It's an old Canadian coin. Been in the family for over two hundred years. I hope so. I'd hate to think I'd lost it. There's no way those Jem'Hadar ships could have tracked us. Dissipating our warp signature didn't work. You're not going to like it. We're going to have to realign the impulse flow regulators. Who said anything about shutting down the engines? You mean, in your face. I'll be piloting the ship. When you finish, we can use the impulse exhaust to detonate the plasma field behind us. Even if the Jem'Hadar survive the blast, the shockwave should wipe out any trace of our ion wake. Point four AU and closing. You'd better get started. I'll do my best. Sorry, captain. We ran into a pocket of boron gas. [Runabout Jefferies tube] You still there, Captain? Just checking. Captain, I hate to rush you [Runabout] But things are going to get very unpleasant if we don't get out of here soon. [Runabout Jefferies tube] That wasn't me. They're firing at us. [Runabout Jefferies tube] Well, that got the adrenaline pumping. No sign of the Jem'Hadar. Looks like we lost them, Captain. Captain? Computer, locate Captain Sisko. Of course they are. (Sisko shoves Eddington against a console. He has a nasty graze on his forehead.) You're alive. What a pleasant surprise. Next stop Athos Four, a grim little fogbound piece of rock in the middle of nowhere. We thought so. That's the general idea. There's too much interference to detect anything, but it's there. We don't need to. There's a shuttle pad not far from the launch site. A few kilometres. This tunnel will take us most of the way. I know. I helped dig them myself. [Maquis settlement] (It's a proper pea-souper in the town square, guv, and no mistake. Eddington and Sisko climb out of the well.) Give me a minute to get my bearings. It's been a while. I didn't think they would. I was wrong. I say we rush them. In this fog, they'll have as much chance of hitting each other as hitting us. You never would've made it in the Maquis with that kind of attitude. I can barely see two metres in front of me. How will I know what I'm aiming at? Attacking two Jem'Hadar soldiers with a pipe? That's a brilliant plan. I know. It could be me holding the pipe. Not really. I just waited to see which of you was knocked down first, and then I shot the one still standing. Now help me drag these bodies over to the well. Maybe that way the other Jem'Hadar will look for their friends and not us. (They chuck the bodies down the well.) That way. Reasonably. (They make their way through various streets and alleys lit with lamps on the sides of the buildings.) We're close. Vance. He was a shuttle pilot, and a friend. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were winning. The Cardassian Empire was falling into chaos. The Maquis colonies were going to declare themselves an independent nation. It's over. That's all you care about? The missiles? I was their leader. I was responsible for them and I failed. I failed them all. I wish I knew for certain that killing you would make me feel better. But I suppose that can wait for another time. [Outside the Command Centre] That's it. You want to stand here and argue about it? Come on. It looks clear. I'm glad one of us remembered they can do that. (At the door, Eddington's code doesn't work. Sisko makes to blast it.) No, wait. I don't want to damage any of the equipment. Let me try something. (He works the inside of the panel and the door opens.) [Command Centre] (There is a group of people inside.) I came as soon as I could. Captain Sisko, I'd like you to meet Rebecca Sullivan. My wife. All right, we're getting out of here. We've got a runabout hidden at the landing site. We can still access the tunnels through the old well. Stick together. Try not to lose each other in the fog. (Eddington gives Rebecca his Jem'Hadar rifle.) Look around you, Ben. Does this look like a launch site? This was our fall back position. But I needed your help to evacuate these people. I would have volunteered. You should be smiling, Ben. That Dominion counterstrike you were so worried about, it's not going to happen. I hope you're ready to finish what you started. We'll finish this later. The Jem'Hadar weren't supposed to be here. No one knew about this base but us. I know. I saw the bodies. I thought for a while there No, we're not going to prison. Not if I have anything to say about it. There's nothing to worry about. You're not going to put us in prison. Not this time. Never. (One of the Maquis gets shot in the back.) Go. Whatever happens, don't stop until you get to the runabout. (to Rebecca) You, too. I'll be right behind you. Now get going. (Rebecca leaves. Sisko joins Eddington and they hold back the Jem'Hadar.) We held the ceremony two weeks before you captured me. For once, you'll get no argument from me. (Eddington is shot.) You'd better get to the runabout. I'd only slow you down. Just get Rebecca and the others to safety. Go! I told you only one of us would be coming back from this mission. [Tunnel] Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen, circle around to the left. Try to hit 'em from behind. Stiles, Dimitris, watch our right flank. Right. Seems like a perfect time for a song. Wish I could think of one. Does anyone know a good song? Something rousing? Too bad. (He stands up and gets thoroughly shot.) Rebecca. (Sisko gets the survivors away safely.) [Promenade]
