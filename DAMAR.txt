Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
Target at four hundred thousand kilometres and closing. (Kira and Ziyal enter) Engineering and Tactical, ready. Waiting on weapons, sir. The phaser banks are still charging. Phasers ready. Target set. Three forty seven. Aye, sir. Sir, we're approaching the outpost on Korma, or what's left of it. From what we can tell, it's been attacked. The planetary defence systems have been disabled. Every building has been destroyed. There are no life signs. Sir, I'm reading a subspace distortion bearing zero zero one mark one five. They're scanning us, sir. Sir, they've stopped scanning us. Nothing, sir. They don't seem to be in a hurry to do anything about us. The Klingon ship has lowered its shields. They're moving off at one quarter impulse. Phaser banks charged. Phasers locked. Target set. Their shields were down and we didn't penetrate their hull. (The Klingon ship turns towards them.) Aye, sir. (The Klingons sail serenely overhead.) They've gone to warp. Correct. Target at five hundred thousand kilometres. Doors opening. Two hundred thousand and closing. We have small plasma leaks on levels two, four and five. Sir? Aye, sir. (Later) Loval system within scanning range, sir. No, sir. Sir, I've got something. They're scanning us. Sir, they've locked their disruptors on us. They're hailing us, sir. Demanding our surrender. They've locked their tractor beam on us. We've breached their hull! Their impulse engines are down. They're adrift. They're re-locking their disruptors on us. Both shields are down to twenty percent. We can't sustain another hit. Weapons secured, sir. I can't do that from here, sir. The communication terminals on the bridge are down but I could re-route it to the Captain's quarters. Aye, sir. (Later) Perhaps I should go help her. Klingon technology is We've completed the repairs on the navigational system and the cloaking device. After the mission you'll all be dead. Personally, I think we'd be better off launching an orbital assault on Gowron's command centre. A full spread of photon torpedoes would take care of him, the Klingon High Command and everyone else within a few hundred kilometres. Why? Because I'm willing to spill a little Klingon blood to get the job done? Sir, they're requesting visual contact. Sir, the holofilter's not working. Sir, they're repeating the request. Contact established. Weapons range in one minute. First, we reclaim Terok Nor, then on to Bajor. We're within weapons range. Sir, the station's shields are holding. Sir, the minefields This is a great victory for Cardassia. I've doubled security patrols throughout the station. You're welcome to try. I suppose you want us to give them back their weapons as well. The Bajorans will never be our allies. Forgive the interruption, but he insisted on seeing you immediately. You're out of uniform, Major. Bajorans could use a lesson in respect. From Gul Dukat. For some reason he thought you would enjoy having me deliver it to you. A gift. For the party tonight. (Damar leaves. The package holds a lovely, simple evening gown.) Where'd you find that? Have your whole race thrown off this station! Get out of my way! I confronted them, they attacked me. That'll be all. (A Cardassian leaves and Kira enters.) What can I do for you, Major? Well, he's not here. Yes. He's in his quarters. (pause) With the other shape-shifter. Jealous, Major? Kanar. Not that one. The twenty seven. I can afford it on a Gul's salary. Dukat wasn't happy about what happened. I had to find a way to make it up to him. Let's just say it will change the course of history. That's very kind of you, Quark, but I can't talk about it. Hello, Major. Just the person I was looking for. We'll discuss it now. Intruder alert. Come with me. [Corridor] (Rom bursts out of the bulkhead.) Well, well. What do we have here? Captain's log, tactical update stardate 51149.5. The Defiant has returned to Starbase three seven five after its successful attack on the Dominion sensor array. Admiral Ross and I have recommended that Commander Dax and the entire Defiant crew be cited for exceptional performance of their duties. [Mess hall] Major, a freighter loaded with Tammeron grain is due within the hour. See to it that Cargo bay five is ready to receive it. Yes, you will. Now. That attitude of yours, Major, it won't be tolerated forever. I don't know what Dukat sees in that woman. Maybe I should have you taste it first. Make sure it isn't poisoned. True. But some people may place a brother's revenge above business. You're a credit to your race, Quark. Unlike your brother, you've chosen to back the winning side. Tell you what? It's better than that. (Damar looks at a Bajoran, who moves away.) It's about the minefield. It's coming down. Remember those field tests I was telling you about? They were successful. We've begun to deactivate the mines. One week. That's right. One week, and the Alpha Quadrant is ours. [Sisko's office] Sir, I have new information on enemy fleet movements. The Second Fleet has fallen back past the Kotanka System, while the Fifth Fleet has pulled out of the fighting along the Vulcan border. Both fleets have converged here, Starbase three seven five. He's been made an adjutant to Admiral Ross. I'm not sure. He should speak to you with greater respect. Ziyal? Sir, I really feel I would be more valuable tracking the enemy fleet. Ziyal, I need to speak to you. Maybe not, but you and your father do. He wants to see you. Stay out of this, Major. Ziyal, listen. Your father is a great man, a man of destiny, but he also carries great burdens. He knows our alliance with the Dominion is a dangerous one. If we show any sign of weakness, our allies will turn on us. That's why we must all help him remain strong. So I ask you to be a true daughter of Cardassia and stand beside him. What's obvious to me is that your father should have left you to rot in that Breen prison camp. But he didn't. He took pity on you and it's your duty to repay him. Now come with me. And if I don't, what happens then? I want your permission to arrest Major Kira. She doesn't want to see you. When I insisted, the Major objected. I did nothing to her. The Federation is moving against us? I'd like to toss that smug little Vorta out the nearest airlock. And his Founder with him. Sir, there is one other thing. I'm concerned about further attempts to sabotage this station. The enemy knows if they don't act soon, it'll be too late. I doubt he was working alone when he tried to sabotage the station. He must've had help. His wife Leeta, Jake Sisko, Major Kira. That we arrest them. Keep them in custody, at least until the wormhole is reopened. Sir, about your daughter. Perhaps it would be better, for her own sake, if Ziyal were confined to quarters. To be perfectly honest, sir, I don't completely trust her. And neither should you. I'm not accusing her of anything. But she is quite friendly with Major Kira. She doesn't appreciate what it means to be Cardassian or to be your daughter. In here. Secure the doors. (Kira turns around to see Damar with some guards.) Ah, Major, here you are. How nice of you to gather your friends for us. I want you to come with us. All three of you. To the security office. We have to ask you a few questions. You'll find out when we get there. Go ahead, Major, try something. Nothing would make me happier. Of course it will. You have nothing to hide, do you? (to Leeta) You certainly don't. [Ops] I'll say this for Captain Sisko, he is persistent. That's the ninth wave of Federation fighters he's sent against us. Yes, sir. [Bridge] The Defiant has broken through all our lines. It's on its way here. Shall I order a pursuit? Sir, the Klingons have outflanked us. Our lines are beginning to crumble. The last mines have been neutralised. We're ready to detonate the minefield, sir. Sir, the Defiant. It's heading for the wormhole. Our weapons, they're offline. They've been sabotaged. That cannot be allowed. [Promenade] You are the Sisko. Adversarial. But what of the Sisko? Sir, the wormhole is opening. (WHOOSH) The Defiant. No, sir. There's no sign of them. They're not there either. I don't know. (BOOM) The Defiant has opened fire on us. Not for a while. Sir, two hundred enemy ships have broken through our lines. They're headed this way. Sir? We have to evacuate the station, sir. We have to go now, sir. The Federation ships, they'll be here soon. We have to get back to Cardassia. I'll send someone for her. You're wasting your time. She won't go with you. [Bridge] You heard her. She's a traitor. (Dukat takes Ziyal in his arms.) We're out of time, sir. The last ship is waiting for us. (Dukat snarls at Damar. Damar runs off.) Fellow citizens, these are great days for Cardassia. Together with our Dominion allies, we have given our enemies cause to fear us once more. (His speech continues under the dialogue.) The war with the Federation accomplished of our goals. Cardassia is strong again, an empire to be feared. We are safe behind secure borders, and no one will ever dare attack us again. From this position of strength, we are poised to take another bold step to insure our future. Peace. It is time to bring an end to this war with the Federation. It is time for us to rebuild on the foundation of strength we have laid. The sons of Cardassia shed Their blood to defend their home. Their sacrifice must not be in vain. The peace we seek will honour their memory, and preserve the gains for which they gave their lives. I challenge the Federation to answer my call for peace. I am ready at any time to meet with its representatives to discuss how we can bring an end to hostilities. As your leader, I pledge that I will do everything in my power To protect Cardassia and allow us to Move forward into a new era. This I vow with my life's blood for my sons, for all our sons. (Transmission ends.) We're on a mission of peace, Major. Maybe he should get in the mood. [Cargo bay] (Damar is talking about a map on the wall screen, Weyoun is sitting at a table.) This is the border as it existed before hostilities broke out. This is the border we are now proposing. (Patrick takes a close look at Damar.) As you can see I've been looking over Sisko's latest counter-proposal. We don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. I don't know why you had me call for peace talks in the first place. I appreciate the faith you've shown in me. What sort of information? Where are they? This is ridiculous. Sneaking into a storage bay for a secret meeting. I'm not some agent of the Obsidian Order, I'm the leader of the Cardassian Empire. Who's not coming? You're wasting time. I mean no disrespect, you know that. But without you the war will be lost and Cardassia will lie in ruins. Don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph. Of course you have. He's just trying to deny you the satisfaction of hearing him say it. You know in your heart he secretly admires you. Isn't that enough? Kill him and be done with it. [Cavern] (Sisko leans on the comm. unit to get himself a drink of water. A panel at the back falls open and a display on the inside says System Off Line.) [Tunnel] Think of it. The leader of Cardassia bringing the dead body of the Emissary back to the Bajoran people. They'll take it as a sign that the Prophets have abandoned them. The Shakaar government will be overthrown and the Federation position on Terok Nor will become untenable. It was a noble, if misguided, vision. The Bajorans understand a clenched fist, not an open hand. The invasion of Romulus? It's too soon. We're engaged in heavy fighting all along the border with the Federation. The Klingons are preparing to go on the offensive and Three weeks? I heard the same kind of estimates before we attacked the Federation. Gul Dukat is a great man. What if the Romulan fleet reacts faster than you're anticipating? What if they pull all of their forces away from the Federation border at the first sign of our attack? No, of course not. I serve the Founders. You're worrying about nothing. Until we find a way to bring reinforcements from the Gamma Quadrant, we have to make due with what we have. Besides, we needed new ships on the Romulan front, so I sent them. Not as vulnerable as you think. We don't need starships to protect Chin'toka. Not anymore. These are our new unmanned orbital weapon platforms. Their hulls are protected by regenerative forcefields and their arsenals consist of a thousand plasma torpedoes. I thought you would. I've already ordered their deployment. (An aide enters.) What kind of a problem? If you're here because of what happened to your daughter. Wait. Why did you come? A combined fleet at Deep Space Nine? You think they'll head for the Chin'toka system? Well then, we have nothing to worry about. The weapon platforms will be operational in time to greet them. I'll make sure that it is. (Dukat enters with his Jem'Hadar escort, carrying a box.) How do you fight a god? Dukat! (Dukat's eyes are red, and his voice is slightly echoing.) The enemy fleet is approaching the Chin'toka system. Still offline. I'll remind you that you said that. [Bridge] I believe you owe me an apology. Now, if Dukat can get our reinforcements through the wormhole A Pah wraith. You believe that the Founders are gods, don't you? In what way? How does that help us? As you can see, we've halted the Klingon advance against Monac Four. We estimate their casualties to be at least thirty percent. I'd offer you a glass, but I know how much you dislike kanar. I wouldn't trust a Cardassian that didn't enjoy a glass of kanar every once in a while. Depends on my mood. And right now, I feel like celebrating. We owe Gul Dukat a debt of gratitude. Do you ever wonder what goes on? Inside the wormhole, I mean. The Prophets and the Pah wraiths locked in some form of celestial battle. It's fascinating. There's a lot about me you don't know. See that Gul Yaltar of the Third Order receives this immediately. (Officer leaves, Weyoun enters.) My guess is that the Bajorans aren't happy about that. That would be a pity. It's only a matter of time until we break through enemy lines. When that happens, we can drive the Federation Romulan Alliance out of Cardassian territory. A bit more kanar? To victory. On all fronts. (Weyoun enters.) Weyoun, this is Siana. We met at the dinner last night honouring Legate Hovas. And why is that? Until tonight. (Siana leaves.) Increase production. Yes, I heard you. By how much? That won't be easy. A very thorough investigation that has found no evidence of foul play. [Runabout Rio Grande] Clones. Keeping track of them is a full time job. [Runabout Rio Grande] Enough bickering. Order him to trigger his implant. I told you it was a waste of time to try to reason with him. You're a dead man, whether you activate that implant or not. That ship will never make it back to Deep Space Nine. Maybe he won't, but I will. Think it over, Shape shifter. One of our attack ships is on the way. (Transmission ends.) I knew there was something wrong with him from the moment we met. He lacked your appetite for cruelty. You really believe I had something to do with that? I was called away. An urgent meeting with the Central Command. I always was lucky. Are you sure I can't interest you in a glass of kanar? I don't know what you're so concerned about. Odo couldn't possibly hope to outrun a Jem'Hadar attack ship. Then he'll die. Unless we stop them, Odo is going to take your predecessor back to the Federation, where he will undoubtedly reveal all he knows, all you know, about our strategic operations. You know what that means, don't you? That's right. And I will not allow that to happen. Cardassia has risked too much, suffered too much. I will not stand by and let all of our plans, all of our dreams for the future, end in defeat just to spare the life of one Shape shifter. They don't need to know he's on board. You simply order them to destroy the runabout. Who's going to tell them? Then we agree. The runabout must be destroyed. Excellent. Now I really think you should try a little kanar. [Ops] I don't understand it. How could a runabout destroy a Jem'Hadar fighter? Then how do we stop them? Consider it done. We spotted a Federation runabout spying on our base in the Olmerak system. Are you feeling all right? Your face. (She morphs the wrinkles away.) As you wish. Did you notice her face? How parched it looked? I wonder. I'm telling you she's not well. We don't know what he told Odo. He may have revealed important tactical The Defiant is returning to Federation space. I'm ordering our ships to pursue. Why? Can't the So'na protect it? Looking for survivors from the Koraga. Our adversaries don't view their soldiers as expendable. They're not bred in hatcheries like the Jem'Hadar. Do you have any idea the casualties Cardassia has taken? There's not a single family that hasn't lost someone in this war. Just something to warm the bones. It's freezing in here. I don't see why we should suffer. She hasn't been in here for days. I wonder what she does in her quarters all day? She didn't look well the last time I saw her. I hope she's not ill. Maybe she's not a god. I'll see to it. Why all the secrecy? Who's she going to be talking to? No, of course it doesn't. [Corridor] (Outside Worf's quarters.) What I wouldn't give to wipe the smirk off that little Vorta's face. (He's talking to a woman.) Still, power does have its privileges. (Dukat enters.) Dukat. Does Weyoun know you're here? My concern is for you. The last time you saw him, you made certain promises. Promises you weren't able to keep. You almost sound as if you believe it. What brings you here? I'm afraid you have an exaggerated sense of my importance. But I'll do what I can. Yes? Am I? Just trying to keep warm. Acknowledged. Excuse me. Dukat? Guilty as charged. [Damar's quarters] (Dukat looks like a Bajoran, complete with earring.) Let's hope she does as well when it comes time to reverse the procedure. Does Weyoun know you're here? What are you doing here? I worked late last night. Where are we going? Why didn't you tell me that before? I have things to attend to. He wouldn't say. And your identity documents. I'm fine. Those were simpler times. You were its leader once. You could be again. And to you. [Promenade] (Dukat comes out of the airlock and strolls along, completely unrecognised.) [Sisko's quarters] (Kasidy is wearing a white shawl that reaches past her waist.) I need to talk to you. I demand to know where we are going. Were you? Interesting device. Thot. that's the equivalent of a legate, isn't it? What did he say? I would have, if I'd known we were meeting with the Breen. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (The female shape-shifter stops to morph away her very dry skin before entering) [Jem'Hadar bridge] I haven't even seen this treaty. This is outrageous! Have you read this treaty? There's a reference to territorial concessions that the Cardassians are to make to the Breen, but it doesn't say what those concessions are. I want to see this protocol. You expect me to agree to territorial concessions when I haven't even seen what they are? There are no minor planets in the Cardassian Union. I don't trust him or his people. The Founders should never have agreed to give away Cardassian territory without my consent! No. Of course not. The Klingons have attacked Septimus Three. Are you also aware that they've landed fifteen divisions? The Cardassian troops will never survive without reinforcements. It is my duty to inform you that you will be turned over to a Cardassian Tribunal where you will be tried as war criminals. That is not necessary for you to know. All you need to know is that you will be found guilty and executed. Wait! (Damar checks that Weyoun is dead, then bursts out laughing.) Overconfidence. The hallmark of the Weyouns. Maybe the Founders should eliminate that from your genetic recipe next time. They'll just make another copy of him, you know. You should've killed me. There's only one Damar. I'm sure you will. Consider his offer, Klingon. You die in two days. Pick that up and let's go. [Winn's quarters] (Turquoise drink is poured into tall glasses.) Well hello. Oh, you misjudge me. I miss him deeply. Here. Let's drink to Weyoun Seven. When the trial is completed. Legal protocol must be observed. The execution is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, fourteen hundred hours. No. Maybe you should talk to Worf again. (Breen enter.) Absolutely not! That database is classified Surely you don't mean that. They don't need to know everything about our military operations in order to help us. I will not! Is that so. Septimus Three has fallen. Septimus Three. An entire Cardassian Order has been wiped out. Five hundred thousand men! You promised reinforcements. By leaving them to be slaughtered by the Klingons. Well, I don't. You condemned a half million loyal Cardassians How many more sacrifices will my people be asked to make? It's time. [Cardassian corridor] (As Ezri helps Worf walk along, Damar shoots the two guards in the back.) There's a Cardassian patrol ship sitting in launch bay three A, two levels above us. Its computer has all the necessary information to get you past our security checkpoints. I want you to give a message to the Federation. Tell them they have an ally on Cardassia. You can either trust me or you can stay here and be executed. You're the one that put the Jem'Hadar in charge of the detention area. Oh, I'm sure she'll understand. But if she doesn't, I look forward to meeting Weyoun Nine. [Winn's quarters] Superb. It's unfortunate that so few of your ships survived the assault. By the way, in case Weyoun has neglected to mention it, the Dominion once sang Cardassia's praises as well. It's really quite simple. They expected the war to be over long ago. It's not. For that, they blame us. Now, if the war isn't ended soon, they'll shift the blame to you. Maybe so, but win or lose, I wouldn't turn my back on Weyoun if I were you. [Sisko's quarters] (Dinner has been thoroughly burnt.) Enter. (A Gul enters with a PADD) Excellent. Sit down. And what if he does? He'll see me conferring with one of my officers. There's nothing suspicious about that. (Rusot pours himself a glass of kanar.) No, we're Cardassians. But right now, Cardassia is an occupied territory. And to defeat an occupying army takes careful planning and secrecy. But we will be fighting to win back our homes and our freedom, and that will make us even stronger. All that will soon end. Now, are you sure we can trust these officers? It'll get longer. With a victory or two all Cardassia will rise up with us. Leave that to me. Now, I want you to get a message to every one of these officers. [Winn's office] Am I? Actually, I had a very restful sleep. I had no idea the Breen could mobilise such a large fleet so quickly. What about them? Then why do they wear refrigeration suits? What are you talking about? Don't you have anything better to do than to stand here and I wasn't aware that I'd lost it. I must admit, things were looking rather grim. You know me so well. And the Breen. We're just one big, happy family, aren't we? A few months ago, the thought of the Federation being driven from Cardassian soil would have been a cause for celebration. But the Dominion victories are no longer our victories. (Damar takes the kanar bottle from Rusot and puts it down.) Now, are our troops in position? Excellent. We attack in seven hours. At least they will be dying for Cardassia, and not the Dominion. [Jem'Hadar Bridge] And so two years ago, our government signed a treaty with the Dominion. In it, the Dominion promised to extend Cardassia's influence throughout the Alpha Quadrant. In exchange, we pledged ourselves to join the war against the Federation and its allies. Cardassians have never been afraid of war. A fact we've proven time and again over these past two years. Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement. And what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. [Security office] We've gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse, we're no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere in Cardassia and what do you find? Jem'Hadar [Promenade] Vorta and now Breen. [Dominion briefing room] (The Founder, Weyoun and the Breen are watching too.) Instead of the invaders, we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a shot. Well, no longer. This morning, detachments of the Cardassian First, Third, and Ninth Orders attacked Dominion outposts on Rondac Three. [Ops] This assault marks the first step toward the liberation of our homeland From the true oppressors of the Alpha Quadrant. [Damar's secret HQ] I call upon Cardassians everywhere. Resist! Resist today. Resist tomorrow! Resist till the last Dominion soldier has been driven [Dominion briefing room] From our soil. Our food supplies are running low. When I spoke to Garak, I told him to bring some. We're in no position to turn down help, no matter where it comes from. Kira Nerys has certain skills she's willing to teach us. Skills we need if we're going to defeat the Dominion. I did hate her. But that's a luxury I can no longer afford and neither can you. I need your support in this, my friend. [Airlock] Welcome to the headquarters of the Cardassian Liberation Front. It's been a long time. Excellent. The Cardassian people won't forget the Federation's generosity. I'll have my men investigate possible locations for other bases. I agree. We'll limit ourselves to targets defended by the Jem'Hadar and the Breen. You were saying the Adarak perimeter defences are vulnerable. Not another word, Rusot. Continue. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the mission was a success. It's been a long day. Why don't we take a break. I am. I'm giving him my support. Has the Federation made any progress in counteracting these weapons? Well, why aren't the Klingon ships affected by these Breen weapons? We're all in this together. By helping Starfleet, we're helping ourselves. They're dead. They weren't a part of this rebellion. The Dominion knew that, the Founder knew that. Weyoun knew that. To kill her and my son. The casual brutality of it. A waste of life. What kind of state tolerates the murder of innocent women and children? What kind of people give those orders? Damar to shuttle. Lower your shields and we'll beam aboard. Let's go. [Quark's cafe] Put your weapons down, both of you! They've finished installing the dampening weapon. He was my friend. But his Cardassia's dead, and it won't be coming back. It won't be beautiful to my eyes until the Dominion is gone. Gul Revok and Legate Goris are ready to bring their troops over to our side. That's over a half a million men. If we can convince Gul Seltan to join us as well, we'll have another hundred thousand. I think that is worth the risk. Before they join us, they'll want assurances that the Federation will support them. Do you have transport coordinates? The bridge is yours, Seskal. Gul Revok. He betrayed us. Everyone I know on Cardassia has either been arrested or killed. I thought you said Enabran Tain used to live here. We're attempting to free our people. Do you want to live under the Dominion for the rest of your life? All eighteen. How could they have compromised our entire organisation? We took every precaution, encrypted every transmission, screened every recruit How arrogant we were to think we could beat them in the first place? I was going to surprise you. Oh, they've been lied to so often, they don't trust anything the Dominion says. Some legend. Anything's better than rotting in this cellar. How do we begin? How much time? Come on, Garak. You! Jem'Hadar! Who are you to treat a Cardassian citizen like that? I choose neither. (Kira shoots the Jem'Hadar, Garak stabs the other one in the neck and runs.) Get back! Get back! (KaBOOM! goes the barracks, sending people flying. When the secondary explosions die down, civilians approach. Damar and Garak pick themselves up. Kira is still in the shadows.) Citizens of Cardassia, hear me! The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed. What you have seen here today proves that that is yet another lie. Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets. I call on Cardassians everywhere to rise up. Rise up and join me. I need you to be my army. If we stand together, nothing can oppose us. Freedom is ours for the taking! I thought we decided it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. If I'm going to lead this revolt, I can't do it hiding in a cellar. It was necessary for me to attend the gathering tonight. Power, communication and transportation facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. And once the Dominion is crushed (Mila comes down the stairs with a tray.) It's been twenty four minutes. I hope so. This will send a clear message to the Dominion. The Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. The Commander is right. We cannot rest until Cardassia's free. And when it is, we'll have you to thank for it. Without you, this rebellion would have died in its infancy. It's been twenty six and a half minutes. Let's see what the Dominion has to say for itself. I should've killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. If you're asking me if I know a way in, the answer is no. Not without a valid security protocol. Nonsense. What's taking her so long? You may kill us, but Cardassia will never With men like you on our side, how can we fail? [Bridge] (More BOOMs as they head to a Cardassian cruiser.) Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. For Cardassia. I don't know, but I'm through hiding in basements. I fail to see what is so funny, Garak. Or just have them send the shape-shifter out to us. What if I give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. No! (And he shoots the Jem'Hadar.) Keep
