The people in Ventax Two live in an agrarian society. At least, they do now. It's an interesting anthropological question. One we were studying before the trouble began. In the distant past, the Ventaxian culture had achieved an extremely advanced scientific level, but a millennium ago they turned their backs on technology. And remained that way for centuries. First contact was made by a Klingon expedition seventy years ago. Since then, the new technology has been available to the Ventaxians. They simply are not interested in it. Virtually no social problems to be found on this planet, In fact, I would have described their society as idyllic until It's hard to believe. Several years ago, Acost Jared, the Ventaxian head of state, began to grow increasingly obsessed with the legend of Ardra. With each passing day, he grew more anxious, and he talked about little else. Ardra is coming back. Ardra will be here soon. We must all leave before Ardra returns. For all intents and purposes, the devil. Captain, these people actually believe they've sold their souls to the devil. Hostage? Jared, you must secure the release of my people. I can't believe you would allow this. Ardra's arrival was supposed to be heralded by the shaking of the cities. Now there has been a series of geological tremors on the planet. Minor quakes, nothing extraordinary. And creating a minor tremor could be the result of a low frequency tractor beam projected against the tectonic plates. It was too brief to pinpoint. The decay rate of these Z-particles makes it almost impossible to trace the source. That would put it in orbit above the western magnetic pole, Running visual scan. Nothing.
