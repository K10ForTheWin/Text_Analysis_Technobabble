This is Chief Engineer Logan. Are we breaking orbit? I need to know now. Ship's log, supplemental. Lieutenant La Forge in command. I am unable to beam up the away team due to an unseen assailant attacking the ship. To make matters worse, Chief Engineer Logan is on his way to the Bridge, and he's not paying a courtesy call. [Bridge] Why are we still in orbit? We're taking a beating. If we follow that plan, we'll lose the Enterprise. In view of the present crisis, I believe you should relinquish command to me. I outrank you. The Captain did not anticipate the Enterprise would come under attack. If he had, would he have left the Bridge to you? You can't fight this thing and win. We've got to break orbit now. Lieutenant La Forge. Geordi. I know you want to do what's best for the Enterprise. So do I. Now the best thing You're ignoring my greater rank and experience. Bridge, this is Engineering. I can't hold this power level much longer. You've got to do something. La Forge, this is Logan. Tell me something. On my way. You are leaving them on the planet. What about your responsibility to Captain Picard and the members of the away team? You're going to separate? You can't fight what you can't see, and you still won't be able to see that thing. Risky.
