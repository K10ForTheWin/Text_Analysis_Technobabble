(a young blonde woman) If anyone can hear me, please send a doctor. Things are getting worse. (Transmission ends) You heard me. Thank God. I'm Kareen Brianon, Doctor Graves' assistant. I'm sorry, I couldn't take the chance. I had no choice. I refuse to stand by and watch you deteriorate. He has pain, shortness of breath, irritability. He's not himself, believe me. His temper is completely out of control. Ira! Excuse me, sir. Are you a Romulan? Can't you do something for him? Attracted? I know I've felt certain feelings from him. And for him. Had I been older, perhaps we could've been. That's not the way it worked out. And now it's like he's afraid to face me. The only one he talks to is your friend, Data. [Graves' laboratory] Hello Data. It's good to see you again. The stars are so beautiful from space. Yet they seem Did Ira tell you that? I guess he's right. I used to spend hours just lying on a hill, looking up. Yes. I understand. (re the viewscreen) How beautiful. You're Data. Ira? How? (Worf enters, and Data notices him) They won't let you get away with it. They'll try to stop you. I won't let you put me in a machine. I want to live my life. I won't let you take it away from me. Ira! Ira, you're hurting me! (Data has been squeezing her hand. He jumps up and leaves) Captain. Captain, look at this. (Lines of text are scrolling down a screen) He's in there. Ira put himself in the computer. Captain's log, supplemental. We've said goodbye to Kareen Brianon, with the hopeful feeling that her future will be a bright one. The intellect of Ira Graves has been deposited into our computer. There is knowledge but no consciousness. The human equation has been lost. [Bridge]
