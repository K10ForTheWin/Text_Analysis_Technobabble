Mommy.
Yes, please. (Wesley runs off with the two boys and girl) I want to do something too. With you. It's something you can teach me. Will you? It's playing ball. Will you teach me? We can get it in the gardens. Come on. [Council Chambers] You're very clever at this. No, Wes! Oh, no! Oh, please, no! He doesn't know. He's from another place.
You will lead because you are accepted by both sides. And because it is in your blood. You will know. You just will. Salia, you must arrive with an open mind, without preconceived ideas of the worlds you will find or the people on either side. You feel the weight of so much responsibility, you're not sure you'll live up to everyone's expectations. It is your duty. It won't be as bad as you think. In fact, it could be quite wonderful. Besides, you are the last and only chance. (The girl changes into a short, big-eyed, hairy creature that chatters at her in alien)
Tunnel sixteen. I'm right behind you. (Their proximity alarms go off too)
