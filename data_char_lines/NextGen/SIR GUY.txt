I have you at last, Robin Hood. (he draws his sword, and Worf draws his own then starts to fight him. Worf gets a gash on the shoulder, then the Norman soldiers fire their bows) Enough, you fools. We'll never find them in the greenwood. [Forest glade] (Data is teaching Deanna about longbows, Geordi is practising his mandolin) Leave us. (the nurse leaves) Do not mock me, Lady Marian. I'm prepared to offer you one last chance to change your mind. Will you marry me? (Vash slaps his face) I see. Then the execution will proceed as scheduled. I warn you, Marian, this pathetic attempt at feigning madness will not save your life. You're mistaken, Sheriff. Maid Marian has promised to be my wife. A toast. To the most beautiful bride-to-be in the whole of England. Have you taken leave of your senses? I suspected as much. You can add sorcery to the list of charges against that rogue. Silence. Any more impudence and it'll be your head on the block. Guard, escort the Lady Marian to her chamber. (the transcriber coughs and splutters at the idea of Sir Guy giving orders to the King's Sheriff!!!!) Of course you would, my child. But I have important business to attend to. (Vash leaves) Lovely creature. There'll be no escape for you this time, Robin Hood. Well done, my dear. It's Marian who deserves the credit. Took him with his own sword. [Marian's chamber] You have been found guilty of outlawry and high treason. Do you have anything to say before sentence is carried out? Prepare them for the block. Guards! Take Marian to the tower. (Vash disposes of one guard, but the other takes her inside) I'll have you know I'm the greatest swordsman in all of Nottingham. (Guy and Picard duel. Worf and Geordi kill guards while Beverly and Deanna smash crockery over heads) And what would that be?
