Ethan. They brought me here with my parents. We were at a research station on Miridian six. The station was set up last year. Then the Romulans came. They took them away. No. I just want to get away. How? Even if we do get away, they'll find us. They found me when I escaped before. Yes. I hid in a secret place for weeks, but they caught me when I came out to find food. (Tomalak and a guard storm back in) This way (they run, shooting another Romulan on the way) In here. [Crawlspace] (Ethan fastens the grill back in place. Another Romulans tests it and tries to look in, then leaves) No, they can't. I heard them. There's something in these rocks. Right. (they go through a hole in a wall into -) [Store room] The Romulans forgot all about this storeroom when they rebuilt their tunnels. Here, use these. Help me. (they build a barricade of boxes in front of the hole, then switch on the light. It's quite a big room) After I got away last time, I mapped out all their tunnels. Supply depot, communications, living quarters and shuttlebay. Only two or three. We can't do that. The transmitter is on a voice-activated security system. Only Ambassador Tomalak. Tomalak. You, er, you told me about him. They've found us! They must have fixed them. We've got to go! The shuttlebay. There's still time. It doesn't matter. Much more. The neural scanners read my mind, give me everything I want. Just like they tried to give you everything you wanted. My world was invaded. My people killed. My mother brought me here so our enemies would never find me. She knew that they would never stop looking for her, so she made sure I would be safe. (the stalagmites light up with machinery) She left the scanners to protect me, to give me anything I wanted. I wanted you to stay. It's been so long. I just want somebody real. I thought that you'd be happy. I'm sorry. My name is Barash.
