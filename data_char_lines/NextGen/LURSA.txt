We wish to address the Council. Members of the High Council, it is a day of great rejoicing for the family of Duras and the Klingon Empire. We have discovered that our brother did indeed have a son and heir. Our allies on the Council backed Toral's claim. It's in Picard's hands, now. Something to drink, Captain? Tea. Earl Grey, perhaps? B'Etor. We don't want you to judge us by your experience with our brother. He deserved to die. We do not wish to be your enemy. Have you made your decision regarding Toral's challenge? Toral has the bloodline to lead the Empire into the next century. He has the support of the people. You see very clearly, Captain. But one thing is missing. If you rule against us and we are victorious in a war against Gowron. It will mean the end of the alliance with the Federation. This is not a threat, Captain. Just an unfortunate truth.
We have discovered that our brother did indeed have a son and heir. No. He tries to be, but he's still unsure of himself. I think he'll find our offer appealing. The Federation fleet has left Starbase two thirty four. They've set course for Klingon territory. At least twenty starships. Picard. Twenty ships aren't enough to wage a war. Starfleet must be bluffing. Welcome, Worf, son of Mogh. The same as you. Personal honour. Glory for the Empire. Our brother made many mistakes. One was to make you an enemy. Toral is Duras' only son, and he will be the leader of the Council. In your heart, even you know that. But Toral needs guidance. A father figure. That could be you, if you were mated to B'Etor. Nothing will stand in our way. Join us, Worf, and usher in a new era for our people. They never came. (Worf is dragged in by his Romulan guard) Kill him. (but Worf fights the Romulan as Lursa and B'Etor have themselves beamed to safety)
Someone must have given it to the assassins to implicate us. Ji'ko to'val! Impossible. I do not. But I am with child.
