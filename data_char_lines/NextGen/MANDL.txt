Velara base to Enterprise. Yes, Captain, I'm Director Mandl. I'm sorry about the delay, but we weren't expecting visitors. We were a little behind, but we're back on schedule. I'd like to hope we'd be allowed to maintain that schedule. Understandably tired. We're working very hard, Captain. No disrespect, sir, but we cannot afford the time. If you will excuse me, sir, I really must get back to work. This is not really the best time. We are at a very critical phase just now. I'm trying not to be rude, sir, but this is really very inconvenient. (channel closed) As you wish.
