Good health to you! State the purpose. (it tones down) State the purpose of what you have done. State the purpose of your visit here. Do you plan to leave life forms here? But you did more at the world you just left. Why have you left your own life forms there? Do not interfere with my children below. (The globe goes over to Data)
