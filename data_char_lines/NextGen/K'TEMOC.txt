What? What is this? (Worf and K'Ehleyr are in Klingon uniforms, sitting where Picard and Riker should be) What treachery is this? By whose authority? I have standing orders to fire on all Federation ships! I have no proof of that. How do I know this is not a Federation trick? How can I be sure? And if I refuse? You dare not destroy us. We are on a crucial mission by order of the Klingon High Command. Wait! Lower the shields. I yield command of the T'Ong to you, Captain Worf. Long live the Klingon Empire. Yes?
