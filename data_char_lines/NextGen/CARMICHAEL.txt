(Irish accent) Mister Pikerd. I'll be reminding you that it's one o'clock. One o'clock on a Thursday. I'm sure I made it clear to you that the rent is always due, payable in full, by one o'clock on Wednesdays. Oh? I haven't heard of any new production. What play is it? Oh, no, no, no, no. I've heard you silver-tongued devils before. I'll have the rent in full tomorrow by one o'clock or you'll be out performing on the street. [Data's hotel room] Mister Picard, I need to be talking to you. What, jealous Oberon. Fairies skip hence. I have foresworn his bed and company. Really? Well, I did do a church play when I was a lass.
