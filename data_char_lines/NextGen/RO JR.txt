What? Great. Just what I want to be. Cute. I was in a refugee camp. Fun wasn't exactly in my vocabulary. Fun is being back at work in my own uniform. [Turbolift] So what the hell am I supposed to do now? Well, I should be doing something instead of just standing around waiting for them to find a cure. What? Fine. Enjoy yourself. I am not twelve years old. If I want to go to my quarters and contemplate my situation, that does not mean that I am pouting. Would you rather be playing with dolls? This isn't some kind of glorious second childhood, Guinan. Our bodies have been violated, changed. Doesn't that bother you? Enjoy what? Where did you get the idea that being short and awkward is some kind of wonderful gift? Look, it was a long, depressing period of my life and I was grateful when it was finally over. I'd rather not relive it. What? That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Most of the time I didn't even have a bed. I most certainly did not. Guinan. This is ridiculous. Oh yeah? I can jump higher. [Engineering] No fatalities or injuries among the children. The Ferengi have taken control of main Engineering and decks twenty three through thirty seven. We could flood the ship with anesthizine gas. If they're typical Ferengi, they're probably very pleased with themselves by now. Maybe even getting a little overconfident. Captain. This is the first time these Jefferies tubes haven't seemed cramped. About fifty metres. Don't tell me you're tired. This is it. Main Engineering. Now we wait. [School room] (Alexander returns) Tag! It's my mother. The funny thing is, I never really drew a picture of her when I was young. It's just, for some reason I wanted to now. It's my turn, isn't it? It's not quite as bad as I remembered it. Being a child, I mean. Well, we'd better get going. Here. I did all of them.
