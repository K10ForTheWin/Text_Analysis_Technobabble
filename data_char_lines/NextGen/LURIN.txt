Enough. Where is the Captain of this ship? I am DaiMon Lurin and I declare this ship to be a loss and open to claim according to the Ferengi Salvage Code. You will cooperate with our salvage operations or we will begin executing your crew. [School room] (Picard is thrown into the room, and the children are left unguarded) We're not affiliated with the Ferengi Alliance. We are in business for ourselves. Yes, it will be highly profitable. For an investment of two surplus Klingon ships, a few repairs and some weapons, we've netted a Federation starship and her crew, not to mention a planet rich in vendarite. They have proved most helpful in extracting the mineral. The addition of your crew will greatly speed up the process. As for your ship, I'm sure that it will fetch a handsome price on the Romulan market. But before that can happen, we need to regain access to your central computer. I think that the mines on Ligos Seven can be very hazardous. Now, how many people on your ship? Very hazardous, Commander. [School room] (the classroom seven computer interface is a talking fish with a male voice) Come in. I understand your son was here to see you. We Ferengi do not bring our offspring along with us aboard ship. I think you will find that they can also be a weakness. Unless you release the computer to our control, I will execute every child on this ship, beginning with yours. It is cruel to put children in danger by bringing them aboard a starship in the first place. You will release the computer and show Morta exactly how to use it. [Bridge] (at a science station) Come in. (Picard enters with a phaser)
