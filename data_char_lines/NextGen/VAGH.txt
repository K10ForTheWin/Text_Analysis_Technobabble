We talk, we socialise, we waste time and the insurrection continues to grow. These rebels need to be crushed not coddled. The Council should be more interested in Federation interference. Your medical supplies have been found in rebel strongholds. Are your weapons also freely available? Then explain this. (Picard catches the phaser rifle that is thrown at him) That and many more like it. As you wish. I have hundreds more. This is the only Klingon colony on the border of Federation space. You cannot deny that Starfleet would be happy to see Krios gain its independence. It would reduce your vulnerability to an attack. And you speak the lies of a taar'chek. You swear well, Picard. You must have Klingon blood in your veins. The Romulans have no interest in Kriosian independence. The planet is too far from their borders. Romulan replications using stolen Federation technology? I still have my doubts, Picard. I will want my own technicians to confirm your findings. You may go. [Bridge] (at Science One) You astonish me, Picard. Did you seriously believe you would succeed? Do you think we are blind? We intercepted the weapons you tried to transport to the surface. Do not insult us both by denying it. Maintain your position until further notice. Do not attempt to leave orbit. (transmission ends) You can thank Ambassador Kell. I am here against my better judgment. But how will it be possible to prove which one was responsible? (Worf tries to walk through the group and is held back by the Klingons) Q'ac ken ta'vak! Arming our enemies is not enough. Now the Federation would murder me to achieve its aims. But to what end? Why would the Romulans want to kill me? This Romulan accomplice, who is he? I am forced to agree, Captain. We will take the Ambassador with us and search him ourselves. Gurt'ank te'la. (and the four Klingons are beamed away) [La Forge's quarters]
