Could you help out a Forty Niner? I fell down a shaft. I got blown up in a tunnel. It is most unfortunate. I require large amounts of whiskey as a linament. I'll take a dime. Well, we're in the same boat, huh? Well, this is my street. You'll have to go find one of your own. Stockbrokers are cheap as hell. Don't even bother to ask. Your best handout is from a young fella with his lady. You give him a chance to show her he's generous. Steer clear of sailors. Most likely you'll get a fist across the jaw for your trouble. A snake? You're an odd fellow, aren't you? But just don't be too particular where you get your funds from. No, no, no, it's too late for that. (goes after another passer-by) Could you help out a Forty Niner? (outside the Hotel Brian) Help out a Forty Niner. Fell down a shaft. Forty Niner. Help me. Help me out. (a tall slim elegantly dressed man with a snake's head cane and a tall slim elegantly dressed woman with a case approach) No. No. (a beam comes from the woman's case to the beggar, and he dies.) Captain's log, supplemental. Close range sensor analysis has yielded no further trace of Commander Data. Despite the emotional repercussions among my crew, I must move this mission forward.
