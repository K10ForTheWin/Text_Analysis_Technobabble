You couldn't be Deanna darling! You probably don't even remember me. Isn't this simply beautiful? I knew romance was still alive, somewhere. Steven, you know full well Lwaxana Troi isn't about to beam on aboard until we leave. So? We've talked it over, Captain, and the ceremony will be tomorrow if you agree. And Captain, would it be possible for you to perform the ceremony? He is qualified to lead a traditional Earth ceremony, which is what this will be. My family and I are living on Earth now. Downhill? Who are you to tell us what we should do? And? Must he do that? You giving thanks? Besides, you never did this before. Love them, of course. Steven! Look at your father, Wyatt. He just can't wait to strip off his clothes for that barbaric ceremony. How could you let this happen? My son, surrounded by those horrible lepers! Beam him back. Wyatt?
