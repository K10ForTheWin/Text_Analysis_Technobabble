You did save it, didn't you? (The two men are scruffy, with five o'clock shadow) You accepted our goods in trade! We need it. Wrong, Sobi. Our planet is in desperate need, Captain. We have people suffering from a lethal plague. You are going to hold to that position? Then you condemn us to death! You disgust me! If you could see the suffering the plague has caused. Well, you are going to, when you see what it does to us. Yes. Every Ornaran does. They lie. We need some now. Now! I don't care if it's your decision. Get us some. Your people don't need it. The Brekkians don't need it. Our people do. We cannot hold out much longer. Hurry up! (T'Jon injects Romas, then himself. Their shakes vanish and they become very, very calm and relaxed. Totally blissed out, in fact, man) They look complicated. We beg you to give us our medicine. I knew it. I knew you'd help us. I'm sure we can come to a fair deal for payment. You are quite welcome on Ornara. Once our freighters are fixed, everything'll be back to normal. What about our freighters? If you don't help us, our ships will soon be inoperable. Do you want our world to suffer?
