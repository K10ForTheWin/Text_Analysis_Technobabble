What are you doing here? You're not from our village. Who are you? How did you survive the storms? But if you were able to get here, the storms must have subsided. Do you think it's safe enough to return to the surface? Let me go with you. I know the terrain better than anyone and I can help. Where is this new land? Why would they be different? And how do you know we'll be safe there? Our chronicle. The history of our village. Doesn't your village keep a chronicle? Then how do you teach your children their history, who their ancestors were, where they come from? Stories change with each person who tells them. This, this will always be the same. Our chronicle has been maintained for seventeen generations. I was only able to save the last six. This shows the destruction of our village. This is you and Nikolai leading us to safety. One of the scrolls is gone. I must have dropped it in the passageway. I'll go find it. Worf, the chronicle is the life of our village. Without that past, our future means nothing. I must find it. Nikolai? Please, help me. Where am I? [Sickbay] Why did you bring us here? But we never left the caves. Then our home is gone. A new life? How can we grow when everything that made us who we are is gone? [Holodeck planet surface] (the group are travelling in sunlight along a rock face) Yes. I believe I would like to go back to my people. I don't know. I'm not sure. It is a fantastic story. I don't think I would like to live my life knowing what I know and being regarded as a madman. That would be disastrous. It would destroy everything they believed in. I can't tell them the truth, but I don't think I can live with a secret. I need some time. Please. [Holodeck planet surface]
