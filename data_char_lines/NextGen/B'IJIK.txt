Greetings, Captain. I regret to inform you that Gowron and the High Council are quite busy and won't be able to speak with you today. Captain, Gowron wishes it were possible to talk with everyone who wants an audience. But he is one man. The demands on his time are formidable. If you would like me to take him a message. A favour? A cloaked vessel. This is no small favour, Captain. How would it benefit the Klingon Empire? I'm sure Gowron will ask. That is what you want me to tell him? I see.
