(not a human) Captain, if you're on schedule, I'd like to confirm that we'll begin the baryon sweep at fifteen hundred hours, approximately one hour from now. Commander Hutchinson also wanted me to make sure that you'll be able to attend his reception this afternoon. He'll be delighted to hear that. Arkaria Base out. [Bridge] (Picard picks up a sort of attach√© case and walks onto the now deserted Bridge. He takes a long lingering look around then gets into the turbolift as workers enter from the other side) Yes. Perhaps. Thank you. You'll excuse me, Commander. I'm sure we can handle this, whatever it is, Commander. There's no need to concern yourself. It's all right. Please, don't worry. I assure you it's all right. We'll look into it. You don't have to concern yourself. Stay right where you are. [Engineering] There is nothing to discuss. Sit down. I am not interested in hearing your hostage negotiation tactics, Commander. All right.
