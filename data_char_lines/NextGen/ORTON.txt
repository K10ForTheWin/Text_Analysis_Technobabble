Yes. Perhaps. Thank you. You'll excuse me, Commander. I'm sure we can handle this, whatever it is, Commander. There's no need to concern yourself. It's all right. Please, don't worry. I assure you it's all right. We'll look into it. You don't have to concern yourself. Stay right where you are. [Engineering] There is nothing to discuss. Sit down. I am not interested in hearing your hostage negotiation tactics, Commander. All right.
