(man at ops) Sensors are picking up subspace distortions and high energy particles directly to starboard. There's another filament moving toward us, sir. Chief O'Brien. The turbolifts aren't working. We're trapped up here. [Turbolift] (three crying children and an injured adult) I have partial sensors back online. I'm picking up sporadic life signs throughout the saucer section. There are definitely survivors. I'm sorry, Chief. The readings are not that specific. I'm not reading any life signs in the drive section. There's no way to know. Without the main computer, I can't run a full diagnostic. Yes, sir. [Ten Forward] (the place is a wreck)
