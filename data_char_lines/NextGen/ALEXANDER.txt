Father! What did he say? You mean you can go? Saddle up, Father. (Alexander puts a stetson on Worf's head) [Deadwood, main street] (two figures walk into town, spurs a-jingling. They are wearing badges) Deadwood. Nineteenth century Earth. The Ancient West. You're the Sheriff and I'm the deputy. Right. [Engineering] (La Forge is plugging a cable into an interface) Well, Mister Barclay helped a little. That's the bad guy. His name's Eli Hollander. They call him the Butcher of Bozeman. He's killed twenty three men. He's the meanest and the toughest gunslinger in the West. You have to watch him. He's fast. If you can. No, no, no. Computer, freeze programme. That was too easy. It has to be harder to beat the bad guys. Otherwise, it's no fun. Computer, increase programme difficulty to level four. Go back to where my father and I first walked into the saloon. Come on, Father. (Alexander and Worf leave) They don't want to get hit by the bullets. Sheriff, look out! (Worf is hit by the chair, but just turns and thumps his attacker. Then he punches out the Mexican.) I asked Counsellor Troi to join us. She loves Western stories. We're supposed to hold him until the US Marshal comes, and then we'll take him to Rapid City for a trial. Your pa's no match for Sheriff Worf. Yes, sir. I'll go to the bank and make a withdrawal. (Alexander leaves) I'm not supposed to be kidnapped now. Computer, freeze programme! Hey, Computer, freeze programme. Father! Yes. Father? After what happened I guess you'll never want to go back to the Ancient West.
I would have won. Where are the other Klingons? Why? Why? I don't want to be a warrior. [K'Ehleyr's quarters] (Alexander runs in and gets a hug) He made me leave. What is this? Let me hold it. (Worf takes it down and the little boy holds it, instinctively moving it in curving motions) Why can't I stay with you? Are you my father?
I'm making a cup for my father. Want to help? Well, you're supposed to put them in a row, like this. Well, it's easy. You take a big piece of clay like this, and push your hand into it. [Bridge] Kryonian Tigers aren't so scary. I saw one once. My father took me to the zoo on Brentalia. All the tiger did was lick my hand. And he smelled funny. I'll get some. (Alexander walks off, and a piece of clay on a tray falls over and squashes the goblet) Clara! Who did? I don't see anybody. I spent two weeks on that. That was really mean. Clara, there's no such thing as invisible people. You're lying. (a piece of clay hits him from behind) Hey!
They were not! I was not! You told me that yesterday, not today! You mean he tells me what he wants and I have to do it. No yelling. I don't want to agree. He's not fair! It's just my regular time to meet with Counsellor Troi. She's not here yet. No, I just wanted to be out of my room before Why? I wanted to leave before my father got back. I hate him. I wish my mother was here. But she died. All he cares about are rules. I'm supposed to do everything right all the time. I don't know how. I'm supposed to wait for Counsellor Troi. What do they do there? What's that? Do you ever drop one? Why are they arguing? Then why are they friends? Excuse me! If you're going to argue, you should remember, the higher the fewer. All the creatures within us? No, ma'am. I wanted to say I'm sorry if I got you in any trouble. What's it for? Why? Their whole life? They must have to like that person a lot. Are you very old? Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! It's my laughing hour. Ha! Ha! Ha! I promised to meet Mrs. Troi for another lesson in happy wisdom. Ha! I promised. Should I break my promise, Father? You said no Klingon ever breaks his word. I don't understand, Father. You're confusing me. Father? The higher, the fewer. (and Alexander leaves) [Lwaxana's quarters] But we're going to go to the holodeck. Ha! What happened? Are you sad? You know that man you're going to marry? He would never come and take a mud bath, would he. You know, maybe this would be a good time to get one of those little people that live inside of you to come out and tell you what to do, or help you, or something. I'm sorry. What's wrong?
No! Wait! (Worf gets soaked by a water balloon) I'm sorry. We made fullerenes in chemistry class today and filled them with water. I forgot. I'm sorry. What? Is that when they hit you with pain sticks? Oh. What do I have to do? What if I don't want to? Well I don't care about that. Mother always said that I didn't have to do any of this Klingon stuff if I didn't want. Okay then. I'm not going to do it. You just said it was up to me. I don't want to be a warrior. [Observation lounge] Ki'rok Molor, ki'rok! What happens now? It's Kahless! Ni'lot Kahless! [Maranga Outpost] (night, and Worf is waiting for Alexander, who comes running) Father. We were watching the fire dancers. K'Nor and Bar'el. They live here on the outpost. I need some money. The man over there says he's got Molor's head in a box. The real Molor. I know. It's mummified. He offered to show us for fifty darseks. Please, Father. He's waiting. But (they are watched by a mysterious stranger) I have to say goodbye to my friends. We're coming back? Yes. She died when I was little. Sometimes. No. Really? I don't know. Yes. I thought they were going to kill my father. I didn't know what to do. Good night, K'mtar. [Bridge] (at the Science station) Why did you want to recreate this? Yes. How can I fight someone that big? All his weight is on his right foot. I don't know. Twelve days, twelve nights. I know, I've heard this story before. Why was Kahless so mad about the lie his brother told? If Kahless would have just explained what happened, maybe they wouldn't have had to fight about it. Why was it so wrong for Morath to run away? Maybe he didn't want to fight his brother because he didn't want to have to kill him. But how do you know that's why? I'm trying to I am part human, too. It doesn't matter what I look like. That's not true. I don't know if I want to do that. I don't want to leave the Enterprise. I thought you were different. I thought you understood me. But you don't. You're just like my Father. All you care about is me becoming a warrior. Just leave me alone! First Officer's log, stardate 47779.4. We've entered the Ufandi system, where we believe the Duras sisters might have come to sell the ore they mined on Kalla Three. [Bridge] I've been waiting. Where's K'mtar? He never said goodbye. When will I see him again? Well, we should start practice.
Why won't you let me see him?  I don't believe you. My father wants to see me. You're the  one keeping me away from him!  Then why can't I see him?  This is part of that Klingon stuff, isn't it. My mother  always said that Klingons had a lot of dumb ideas about honour.  Well, it isn't very important to me. I don't care about  being Klingon, I just want to see my father.  Father?  (Worf is wearing the motor assistance bands, and standing up)  Deanna said you hurt your back, that you couldn't walk.  I was worried about you.  I understand.  Father!  You said you wanted to see me?  Anything, Father.  I'm glad, Father.  Yes, sir.  (Alexander takes the knife away)  Chief Medical Officer's log, supplemental. After  further consultation with Starfleet Medical, and a great deal of soul  searching, I have reluctantly granted Lieutenant Worf's request to  undergo the genetronic procedure.  [Worf's private room] We started doing multiplications today.  The teacher said I'm faster than anybody else in my class.  (Alyssa enters)  Yes, Father.  (Alexander leaves)  I want to see him.  No! I want to see him.  [Operating theatre] (Worf has been turned over onto his back. Alexander  starts to cry, then Beverly notices something)  Yes, sir. <Back  to the episode listing Star Trek ® and related  marks are trademarks of CBS Studios Inc.  Copyright © 1966, Present.

I was just playing. I'm sorry, Captain. Go ahead. Mission accomplished, sir. The one in sickbay never saw me. I found this in the school room. Is it yours? (the comm. badge is activated as he hands it over. Bye, bye, Berik.) [Corridor] (Keiko hypos a Ferengi into unconsciousness) [Corridor] (Picard leaves the schoolroom) Yes, sir. [Bridge]
Hello. I'm not going back. [Ten Forward] Yes. Yes. Ah ha. The forty third day of Maktag, stardate 43205. No, sir. I don't know. I don't know. Kahless? I'm sorry, Father. I won't do it ever again. I promise. Did you see it, Father? I won. I'm training. You said you wanted me to be a warrior. I have not lied! She's lying! She hates me, that's why she makes up stories about me! You said we could go see the gilvos again. You promised. You said that we could. No! I won't go! No, sir. I'm almost done. Why? I understand. You're ashamed of me. You don't care about me. All you care about is your honour! My mother wouldn't send me away. Father? My leg hurts. I'm scared. (with a massive paternal adrenalin rush, Worf moves the debris just as Riker returns with a lever. Worf takes Alexander in his arms) The gilvos! Please, they'll die! [Bridge] Are you going to get in trouble because of me? Am I in trouble? I'm sorry. I promise I'll be good at the Klingon school. I'll make you proud of me. I accept your challenge, Father. I will stay.
