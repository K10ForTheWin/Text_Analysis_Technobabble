What do you know of this human? Jean-Luc Picard, a Starfleet Captain. Enter. Yes. Pardek, come in. Please. I've never liked titles since I was a lowly Uhlan in the Romulan guard. I am Neral. How is it again, Pardek's tried to show me. (they swap hand gestures) Good. Will we see you and your wife tomorrow at the state dinner? It's been years since old Pardek's been invited to an official function. He's far too attached to the common man for most peoples' comfort. Let me tell you something, Spock. We're going to start something here, you and I, that will redraw the face of the quadrant. I believe it must eventually come. Our two worlds need each other. I want you to know exactly where I stand. Things are not what they once were in the Senate. The old leaders have lost the respect of the people. Involvement in the Klingon War, endless confrontations with the Federation, they're tired of it. Times are changing, and leaders who refuse to change with them will no longer be leaders. Spock, I am prepared to publicly endorse the opening of talks between our peoples. What do you think the Vulcan people think of that? But surely with a man of your influence leading the way? Very well. Can we meet again tomorrow? Good. Jolan tru, Spock. Oh. Live long and prosper.

Ah, Senator Pardek. You received my message. What do you know of this human? Jean-Luc Picard, a Starfleet Captain. You haven't seen him recently? I have received intelligence indicating he's on his way here. Perhaps here already. Yes. Curious, isn't it. I suppose we'd better find out if the report is accurate or merely rumour. Circulate his likeness among the security forces. Remind them that if he is here, he's probably disguised as one of us.
