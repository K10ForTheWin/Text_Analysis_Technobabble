(a woman) Health and happiness. You did return as promised. (She greets Riker with a slow, loving hug) And I welcome this huge one. Oh, yes. But you are a young one. I do not know your custom regarding love. Shall we go there now or remain in play? At love. Unless you don't enjoy that. (to Worf) Perhaps you do? Oh, this is unfair to him. We'll go to the Council Chambers. You'll find young people your age there. Come! Our people will want to know you. Good health! I thought you might be out of breath. And now it's time for you to meet some new friends. [Council Chambers] (Musicians are playing gentle tunes, some couples are dancing, others strolling with glasses of drink. One man is getting a massage) Everyone! We've brought the visitors! Oh, we have very few. They are called Mediators. And they are needed only in one place each day. And so no one risks death. by breaking any law. Then no one breaks that rule. Who wants to risk execution? And there's always a white wall or fence to remind anyone of a forbidden area like that. He is safe and unharmed. We promise that. Captain Picard, I do not know how you Earth people conduct law and justice, even if you respect such things. We are a people of law. They do sometimes bring us sadness, but we have learned to adjust to that. Perhaps your laws work as well. But you did once? But when you did, was it believed necessary to do so? Riker has explained it to us. Because you are strangers, we are delaying enforcement of the law. But we must act by sundown. Do you mean God? As you just did. As existing both here and in another place also. Of course. I'll go as a hostage for the boy's safety. I'm frightened. But this is a city. A great city. Since you have all this power, why be concerned about our laws? You could take the boy from us. Do you mean my world? You said we'd be high above it. It has appeared before. Captain Picard. I saw you share the sky with God. You must be Gods.
Everyone! We've brought the visitors.
