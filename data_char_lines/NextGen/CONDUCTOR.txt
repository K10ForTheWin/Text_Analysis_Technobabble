Tickets! Tickets please. Please have your tickets ready. Thank you, sir. Thank you, madam. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Tickets please. Very nice, sir. Enjoy your trip. Tickets please. Tickets. Thank you sir. (The conductor clips one of the knight's string of paper dolls) Tickets please. Tickets please. Get away from there. Would you gentlemen care to show me your tickets? I don't think you folks belong on this train. You go back to the engine. This doesn't concern you. Now we're on the right track. Ladies and gentlemen, we are on our way! (cheers all round and the gangster takes a house brick from the engineer's overalls) You take good care of that. We can't afford to lose it. Now, are you people going to leave or are we going to have to throw you off the train? Keystone City, next stop. Keystone City. Well, look who's back. Well then I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me your tickets? Right. Sorry, boys. You're getting off right here. You don't belong on this train. Guess I was wrong about you folks. Welcome aboard. (the lights dim) We've been having some problems. The engine is running out of steam. I hope we make it to Vertiform City on time. Well, I could use a pair of strong arms in the engine room. Might help us get back on schedule. There's the coal and there's the boiler. I'm much obliged for your help. (Worf starts stoking) Well done, sir. I think this'll make a difference, all right. [Bridge] Keep it steady. Put your back into it. That's the ticket. [Bridge] Something's wrong. This was supposed to be Vertiform City. (the beam disengages and the object stops glowing) We've been on the wrong track all along. (the Conductor pulls the brake lever and everyone gets thrown around) [Holodeck- train] That's far enough. A shorter route? Well we're already behind schedule. If you can get us there on time. All right, go on, but no funny stuff. I hope you know what you're doing. (Data closes a valve and pulls on the brake) [Bridge] Well, what do you know? We're here.
