En-ter-prise. We speak to you in your language. The time has come to honour us in ours. You are not captain? You offend us! We will not show ourselves to a mere subordinate. We await your Captain's greeting with growing unrest. End of communication. You have honoured us with your words of greeting. A new day dawns between us. (Applause from the Bridge crew)
