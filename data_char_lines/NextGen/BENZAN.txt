No! You can't! That's not what I mean. No! You can't. No, he's not. Nothing has been stolen. The Jewel of Thesia has been taken into custody by its rightful heir. Me. I was to give it to Yanar as our pledge of marriage. Yanar is carrying my child. If I had told you I was giving the Jewel to Debin's daughter, you'd have disowned me. Yes, because I didn't believe for one moment that you could catch him. And once Yanar accepted the Jewel the marriage would have been made. Marry me. We'll find a new planet to live on.
