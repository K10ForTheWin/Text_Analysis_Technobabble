Yes, sir. And will this be a sequel to Connecticut Yankee, Mister Twain? With an e. Got it. (Data comes out of his hotel) Thanks for your help, officer. Yes, sir. Mister Clemens. What brings you here? One of the patients said that, yes, sir, but the police deny it. They say a band of outlaws set off an explosion in the hospital and then escaped. The carriage they escaped in was driven by an albino. You know him? Yes, at least a dozen. An invasion from the future? Mister Clemens, what can you tell me about this? Do you have any proof? Five o'clock, sir. Thanks, Mister Clemens
