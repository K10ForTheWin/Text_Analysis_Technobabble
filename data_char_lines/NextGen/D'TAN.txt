Jolan Tru, Mister Spock. Here, look what I've brought you. (it is a small book) They read to us from it at the meetings. It tells the story of the Vulcan separation. I just wanted to show it to Mister Spock. Will you tell us more stories about Vulcan? Jolan Tru. Spock! I've been looking for you. Does he still speak of reunification? Have you ever seen these? (odd shapes small blocks) They were my toys when I was small. Yes, as did their parents before them, to prepare us for the day when we would live again with our Vulcan cousins. This way. Pardek never saw these caves. It's safe. They won't find us here.
