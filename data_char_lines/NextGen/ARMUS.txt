I warn you. Touch him and he dies. If any of you leave now, he dies. [Bridge] And so do the survivors of the crash. (Riker's screaming face appears in the slick, and sinks away again) [Sickbay]
Very good, tin man. [Bridge] I am Armus. Why are you here? You haven't given me a good enough reason. Why? An interesting notion which I do not share. You may now leave, if you wish. I warn you. Your friends have deserted you. They're not coming back. I killed one of them. How could you be in there and know that? Do you want to know why I killed her? Exactly. It had no meaning. I did it because I wanted to. It amused me. No. It was too easy. I need nothing. Not yet. And what is that? Oh, is that what I want? If breaking their spirit will amuse me, then that's what I will have. I lied to you. They came back. No. No. Not being able to contact you, not knowing if you are alive, makes them uneasy. Can't you feel how worried they are? They care for you. You must be very special. Equally? Yes. What others? What do you know of them? I will tell you nothing. She said you'd be back. For now. Why have you returned? Maybe I want nothing. I still might. If I tell you, will you give it to me? Say please. You ask nicely. I will allow it. Wait! I've changed my mind. Talk to her from here. So what. You are all ungrateful. It? Does that mean I am not alive? But you said I did not register on your instrument. Perhaps your instruments are useless. (Data's tricorder and phaser fly away, and Geordi's visor falls to the ground. He gropes to find it) Don't help him. Aren't you going to lead him to his sight again, robot? Then give it to him. I will find something else to amuse me. (The slick covers the shuttlecraft again) [Shuttlecraft] You said they wouldn't amuse me. You were right. I am alone. Creatures whose beauty now dazzles all who see them. They would not exist without me. They perfected a means of bringing to the surface all that was evil and negative within. Erupting, spreading, connecting. In time it formed second skin, dank and vile. Yes. And here I am. Your pity? Save that for yourself. [Planet surface] (The team are not watching when Armus leaves the shuttlecraft and approaches them. Riker is grabbed by an invisible force and dragged by the feet to the slick) Touch him and he dies. If any of you leave now, he dies. [Bridge] And so do the survivors of the crash. (Riker's screaming face appears in the slick, and sinks away again) Captain's log, supplemental. There is grave danger to the crew on Vagra Two. My first officer is missing, attacked by this entity known as Armus. [Bridge] He resists. If he would give himself over, the pain would diminish. He struggles. You should feel his strength. Should I let him go? Perhaps. And would you give yourself for him? Would you give that much? Just for him? Perhaps. Ah, another has arrived. [Planet surface] (Picard is with the team. Armus slithers over to them) You are the one in charge? Answer, Tin Man. Maybe. Don't you want to ask me what I want? Not even to protect your own existence? Entertain me. (Picard shakes his head) Then I will do it myself. You, Tin Man. (Data moves jerkily, and points his phaser at Beverly, then Picard) Now tell me, how would you feel if you were the instrument of death for your leader? Perhaps killing the Doctor would engender more feeling? And what about you, Doctor? Are you ready to die? Tell me you are not afraid. Beg me to spare you. One of you is going to die, and you, Doctor, get to choose. You don't like that, do you? No. You are going to live. One of them dies. (Data's arm swings around and ends pointing the phaser at his own head) Maybe this one. Though I would not call it death, since he is only a device. Tell me, Tin Man, how does it feel to face your own extinction. So what do you think? A moral judgment from a machine. I have your man in here, and the others in the shuttle. I can kill them. Have them amuse me. Not possible. And you claim you care about your comrades. You want to see your people? Then, here. Look at this one. (Riker is tossed out of the slick, covered in oil) No. They are incapable of entertaining me. They may leave. (The team are beamed away) I want to leave this place. For which I will trade you lives. Will you give me what I want? If you must. [Shuttlecraft] (Armus transports Picard into the shuttlecraft) Satisfied? Then can we leave? She told you about them. Since they left. A very long time. Save your compassion. It's revolting. You offer it like a prize when in fact it's an insult. You overrate your gift. You humans are puny, weak. And still you die from a flake of my power. You do not understand. I do not serve things evil. I am evil. I am a skin of evil left here by a race of Titans who believed if they rid themselves of me, they would free the bonds of destructiveness. I will kill you, and those in there.
