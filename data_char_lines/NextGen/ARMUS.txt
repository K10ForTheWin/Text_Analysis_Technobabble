Your friends have deserted you. They're not coming back. I killed one of them. How could you be in there and know that? Do you want to know why I killed her? Exactly. It had no meaning. I did it because I wanted to. It amused me. No. It was too easy. I need nothing. Not yet. And what is that? Oh, is that what I want? If breaking their spirit will amuse me, then that's what I will have. I lied to you. They came back. No. No. Not being able to contact you, not knowing if you are alive, makes them uneasy. Can't you feel how worried they are? They care for you. You must be very special. Equally? Yes. What others? What do you know of them? I will tell you nothing. You said they wouldn't amuse me. You were right. I am alone. Creatures whose beauty now dazzles all who see them. They would not exist without me. They perfected a means of bringing to the surface all that was evil and negative within. Erupting, spreading, connecting. In time it formed second skin, dank and vile. Yes. And here I am. Your pity? Save that for yourself. [Planet surface] (The team are not watching when Armus leaves the shuttlecraft and approaches them. Riker is grabbed by an invisible force and dragged by the feet to the slick) And so do the survivors of the crash. (Riker's screaming face appears in the slick, and sinks away again) Captain's log, supplemental. There is grave danger to the crew on Vagra Two. My first officer is missing, attacked by this entity known as Armus. [Bridge] He resists. If he would give himself over, the pain would diminish. He struggles. You should feel his strength. Should I let him go? Perhaps. And would you give yourself for him? Would you give that much? Just for him? Perhaps. Ah, another has arrived. [Planet surface] (Picard is with the team. Armus slithers over to them)
And so do the survivors of the crash. (Riker's screaming face appears in the slick, and sinks away again) [Sickbay]
