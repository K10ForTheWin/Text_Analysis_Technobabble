Hello. A few of us were just gathering together for our laughing hour. Would you care to come laugh with us? Were you? What an idea! My friends and I will join you. One can always laugh in the bath. Oh, no. No, no. These are my worlds. I protect them. I am a master of worlds, and they fly only as I wish. (to an identical couple) We're having guests for laughing hour. Would you care to join us! They're friends. They love contradiction. They thrive on challenge. They flourish in conflict. He does this every day. Usually while everybody's food gets cold. It's rather boring. Are we ready for the entertainment? I was just juggling and I happened to catch one in my mouth. It tasted good, so I ate it. Before I knew it, I'd eaten up every one of my worlds. It never occurred to me that once they were gone, I'd have nothing left to juggle. If you ever have a world, plan ahead. Don't eat it.
