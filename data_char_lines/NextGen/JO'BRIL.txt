I will volunteer for that task. I've spent years studying solar plasma reactions. The thought of being able to penetrate a star's corona. It is a remarkable opportunity. I've studied your data, Doctor Reyga. I think you're on solid scientific ground. I'm an accomplished pilot. It will be no problem. I am one million kilometres from the star's corona. Proceeding at three quarters impulse. I should reach it in approximately three minutes. Wait. I'm reading elevated neutrino levels in the cabin. Three hundred and fifty thousand kilometres and closing. This is incredible. I am actually flying into a star. I am now fully engulfed in the corona. It's astonishing. I saw the sun. (and he dies) [Crusher's quarters] I'd think after your autopsy on me, you'd know the answer to that. It is a natural result of physiostasis. Takarans can control their physiology at a cellular level. We can create the appearance of death. Move away. Move away. I'm sending out a transient subspace signal. It will obscure the shuttle from the Enterprise sensors and they will interpret it as a warp engine breach. They will believe that you have been destroyed. I'd like to thank you, Doctor. All I wanted to do was discredit Reyga so that no one would pursue his technology except me. But you have given me more than I could have hoped. Now I can take the prototype itself back to Takara, where I will develop it into a weapon. All I have to do is wait here until the Enterprise is convinced you are dead, and leaves. (Beverly knocks the phaser from his hand and starts tapping at the controls. The shuttle lurches, knocking Jo'Bril off his feet. The shuttle goes deeper into the sun as they wrestle for the weapon. Beverly wins, and shoots a hole right through Jo'Bril, but it doesn't stop him. Finally she disintegrates him and returns to the shuttle's controls.) [Bridge]
