A most thoughtful and generous offer, but Timicin has obligations at home. And it would take us some time to select a replacement. That will not be necessary. We'll contact you as soon as we're ready. We expect Timicin to return home as soon as possible. And again, gentlemen, many thanks. (transmission ends, doorbell rings) Timicin, I cannot believe this. Why asylum? Asylum from what? Yes, and your family and colleagues are already gathering for your Resolution. Are they forcing you into this? Are you being coerced? I cannot believe that a man of Timicin's stature would freely choose to reject his own culture. Others started your work, others will finish it. It's always been this way. It always will. You have helped quite enough, Captain. I suggest you return Timicin and depart. If you attempt to leave orbit with Timicin on board, our ships have been ordered to open fire.
