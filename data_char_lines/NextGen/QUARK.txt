How could I forget the only man ever to win triple down dabo at one of my tables? I thought I explained that my brother had misplaced the key to the safe. Besides, those vouchers I gave you are every bit as good as latinum. Is that what this is about? You're on your way and you're calling to reserve a holosuite programme? What would that be? Yes, Lursa and B'Etor. Big talk, small tips. Well, I did hear a rumour, actually. Oh, I don't know. I'm sure it was told to me in confidence. How many vouchers do you have, again? I believe the rumour was that the sisters were trying to buy some second hand mining equipment. They learned of a magnesite deposit on the Kalla system. It belongs to the Pakleds, but those fools don't even know it's there. Your, er, friends tried to get at it. Don't bother. I voided them while we've been talking.
