(old man) Who is this? Our seer died when the storms first came. We've been without his guidance for many weeks. What's wrong? Seer. I am an old man. Would you help me with my gear? That is Tarrana, my daughter. I am fortunate she was old enough to survive the storms. She is a beautiful girl. She has not been promised to anyone. If I do not reach our new home, I would like her to become your wife. Thank you, seer. We will be killed. The tents won't protect us.
