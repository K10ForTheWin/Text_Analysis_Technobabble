The quicker we can come to terms, the better, NCC 1701-D. I am Tarr. DaiMon of the Ferengi. You wish to discuss surrender, Captain Picard? Unconditional surrender, I warn you, is totally unacceptable! We will die to the last one of us before such dishonour! Your complete message not received, Enterprise, but visual communication is against our custom. You give us no choice, Enterprise. May we have a visual on you as well? Yes. The ugliness of the human was not an exaggeration. I do not know how your twisted alien culture has paralysed our vessel, but I concede your Enterprise is superior. We will return your worthless T9 device and we offer the life of our second officers as required by the Ferengi code. Is this to your satisfaction, Picard Captain? Your alien images again shock us. Our own probe has already shown us your trickery, human. We withdraw our surrender. I prefer a more profitable one, human. Explain what means yankee traders? We seek only what is equitable. What do you seek? Why did you begin by attacking us? Which we know is ours. Your barbarous Federation placed it on one of our planets! The Ferengi are not uncivilised, human! Are you suggesting otherwise? Are you now calling us thieves?! On that matter there can be no argument. And what is a swap? Yes, trade, human. What do you offer? Ridiculous. How will we know you will not withhold information? Amusing, human. Trust each other? And what profit is in this, Picard Captain? We will agree, no doubt foolishly. But you are warned that any further trickery on your part will be met with no mercy. We have a matter-energy device of our own. We will beam a science team of three to whatever co-ordinates you propose.
