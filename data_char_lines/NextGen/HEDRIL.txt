(a little girl) Like my vocal enhancer. It helps me make sounds. What? Arbor means tree. Heaven? Yes. Is it my fault? I make her sad. Because it's true. Counsellor, I hope your mother gets better. Who is Hedril? Help me. Help me, papa. (Hedril and Ian are playing with a small dog by the pond, while a baby is sitting nearby) I won't. Mommy, can we go play by the water? Please? (the baby cries) Mommy, please?
