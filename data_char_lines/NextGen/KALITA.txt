Did you kill that Cardassian soldier? That's a risky thing to do in the Demilitarised Zone. You can end up being hunted by Starfleet and the Cardassians. We're asking the questions. Who are you? We want to check your story. When were you there? You resigned? We've just heard a disturbing rumour. One that I think we should take seriously. A trader coming from Pendi Two said he could verify that the Cardassians are going to start supplying their colonists with biogenic weapons. The Cardassians always seem to find a way around problems like that. If we put in a request for more, it'll draw suspicion. How? The Enterprise is a fortress. We can't let her do something like this. We don't know anything about her. What? All right. But I'm going with her. I had no idea it was going to be so easy. How do you plan to get out of the Demilitarised Zone without being searched at one of the checkpoints? There are sensor buoys all along the border. If we cross anywhere other than a checkpoint, Starfleet will send a ship to investigate. Starfleet changes those codes all the time. Should be able to? Of course I do. We need those medical supplies. What's wrong? I'm getting us out of sensor range. This is insane. We're sitting here, no sensors, blind to the outside, waiting for a galaxy class Starship to come swooping down on us. They're scanning our last position. How are we going to beam through their shields? Won't they detect us? Energising. (their hold is filled up) Ro parked us between their warp nacelles. I thought she was crazy, but it worked. She knew exactly what she was doing. See you later. (Santos and Kalita leave) What is Starfleet going to do about it? We can't let that convoy reach its destination. Go ahead. Standing by.
