Hey, Dix. What do you know and what do you say? See this? (newspaper) Germany's getting ready to invade England. Somebody'd better. I don't know if I should pour you one, Dix. Sounds like you've got a snootful already. The usual. What else? (Picard takes Madeline's proffered cigarette, Rex lights it. He takes a puff then looks at it from arms length) And for the lady? Right. I don't mind you being on the cuff, but you're up the sleeve halfway to my collar. No, it's on account of Jimmy Cuzzo. Yeah. Yours and mine. I don't want to face him at all. I'm hoping that seeing us together will slow him up long enough to get some things straight. Then you just have to kill him. [Sickbay] I'm as jumpy as Haircut Lapinski trying to land on a fraction. Captain? Your friends've got time for one drink, haven't they, Dix? Hm. Don't think I have one. Just Rex, that's all. So, fellas, tell me your troubles. She's got looks and bucks? Sounds like you've got yourself a heck of a deal. [Lwaxana's quarters] Good God, what's that? (Lwaxana and Homn enter) I'll bet that's the broad with the big bucks. Come on over here, darlin'. I got the best stool in the house saved for you. Anyway, why would a beautiful high-class lady like yourself want to hook up with a mug like that? You're too good for him, if you ask me. You're not so bad yourself. In fact, you're as much class as this joint's ever seen. Here. On the house. It's French. Almost. But not with me, huh?
