Commander Quinteros. Request permission to come aboard. Captain. Commander. You're late. We expected you a week ago. Is there anything specific you wish to report, or that we should be aware of? I knew you would be - I was in charge of the team which put her together. They're not gentlemen, or ladies, Commander. They are a unified pair. They're always together. This is One Zero. (device on left of head) And this is Zero One. (device on the right) They just finished upgrading the computers on the Wellington. Did a great job. They work very quickly, but it'll be very tight. Thank you, Captain. I don't think we'll need you until we're ready for inspection. [Corridor] Why not just ask them? Please stand out of the way. You haven't time. Look. Your ship is almost clear. (Enterprise gracefully backs out of the space doors and warps away) [Holodeck] (The only red here is Minuet's dress. Riker and Minuet are staring into each other's eyes) The Trieste. Plus it's sixty six hours away. I haven't seen them. What makes you think so? We're rushing repairs on the USS Melbourne, but it's still eighteen hours until she'll be ready. There's nothing else you can do. [Transporter Room] This is Starbase 74. Captain Picard, what is your situation? [Bridge]
