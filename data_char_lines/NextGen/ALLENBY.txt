(a young blonde) Aye, aye, sir. [Shuttlecraft] Coming into position at one thousand metres. Aye, sir. One half impulse.
(a young auburn-haired woman) Deflector shields are not encountering elevated levels of interstellar matter. Aye, sir. Aye, sir. Aye, sir. Captain, we've started moving again. Something is pulling us. [Troi's office] (Deanna has woken, but is still in pain) New heading confirmed. Zero two five mark two seven three. Speed is holding at one tenth impulse. New course laid in at ninety degrees to starboard. Aye, sir. Nothing, Captain. Speed and course are unaffected. No change. Aye, sir. (the ship shakes) All engines down. We're still being pulled. Same heading, same speed. [Troi's office] Setting a new course at optimal shearing angle. Bearing two one seven mark two zero three. Unchanged. We have not broken free of the graviton field. A cosmic string? Same course, same speed. No change, sir. The cluster is unaffected. Same course, same speed. They're slowing. [Engineering] The beings have resumed their course into the string. Three seconds to impact. (Deanna stands up and gasps)
