Tell me more about this cake. Her upper body. Describe the knife you used to cut the Counsellor. How long? And what happened next? And did you? I believe you are experiencing a classic dismemberment dream. Or in your case, being a mechanical man, a dismantlement dream. Your mechanistic qualities are trying to reassert themselves over your human tendencies. Ego and id struggling for domination. The workmen symbolise the ever present id constantly working to destroy the ego. Now the image of Counsellor Troi, a female, is devoured by you, clearly indicating an unconscious desire to possess your own mother. Do not interrupt. The knife in its violent connotation suggests a certain feeling of sexual inadequacy. Ach! Impotence on top of everything. It is all becoming clear to me now. There might be a paper in this. Classic transference. Your anger toward me is, in fact, the animosity you feel toward your father. You are a polymorphously perverse individual, Mister Data, and I recommend full psychoanalysis. I believe I can fit you in next Tuesday. I am Doctor Sigmund Freud. If I were to interpret my own appearance in this dream, I would say I am the symbolic representation of Data's unconscious mind trying to warn him about the dangers he perceives around him. Of course. Answer it. Nien, nien, nien. Do not be so literal. When I say answer it, I mean respond to it, to them. (the workmen enter)
