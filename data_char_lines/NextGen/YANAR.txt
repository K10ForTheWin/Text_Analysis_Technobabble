Wait. Since all of you believe Okona is the father of this child, then so be it. I'll marry you. Yes, I can. If I'd told you it was Benzan you would have gone to war with his father. So I let you believe it was Okona. Well, I never got it. Anyway it's too late. I won't marry Benzan. I won't marry anyone! [Outside Holodeck] I do love you. It is your child. Our child. Yes. (Okona throws the Jewel to Benzan, who catches it and gives it to Yanar) Thank you, Captain.
