My name is Minuet and I love all jazz except Dixieland. You can't dance to it. Waiting for you. Oh yes, Will. I've never been more serious in my life. (The Bynars leave) [Bridge] Your work's very important to you. Can we dance once before you leave? From following you. I can anticipate your lead. So, tell me about your work. What is it about it that consumes and enthralls you? You're very fortunate. To be exactly where you want to be. And it's great that you realise it. A dream? Is that what this is? Is that what I am? Thank you. As real as you need me to be. (They kiss for a long time, then the holodeck doors open and) Aren't you going to introduce me? Enchantee. Comme c'est merveilleux de vous voir ici. Au fond, c'est vrai, nous sommes tous Parisiens. I have been hoping to meet you. Indirectly. Come, join us, Jean-Luc. A glass of wine? Will was saying how much he enjoys this assignment. It's a credit to you. For a ship and crew to function well it always starts with the Captain. You set the tone. In what way? It was very simple. When I heard your name, I merely accessed the foreign language bank. Oui, mon chou. [Observation Lounge] (Data is continuing to paint, or not to paint) And the boy never found out? I'll bet both of them were all smiles. You handled that in a very thoughtful way. You're very good with people. Don't you agree, Jean-Luc? Oh, Jean-Luc, spoken like a true Frenchman. Oh, don't go. We have time. There's no rush. I'd really like it if you would stay. Wait! We haven't danced. Then some more wine. Wait! Please! Please, don't go. You can't. Not yet. Yes. Yes. When they saw your interest in me, they thought I could distract you and keep you here. Your being here was just a fortunate happenstance. I'm not programmed to give you that information. A star in the Bynar system went supernova and they miscalculated. The electromagnetic pulse from the explosion was going to knock out their main computer. The star went supernova before it was expected, and you were late arriving at Starbase 74. I don't know. I don't have those answers. Yes. Return the data stored on the Enterprise's computer back to the one on Bynaus. You don't know? I don't know what you're talking about. They're dying. They meant you no harm. It was their world they were trying to save. Help them, Will. Hurry. Please. [Bridge]
Waiting for you. Oh yes, Will. I've never been more serious in my life. [Sickbay] A dream? Is that what this is? Is that what I am? Thank you. As real as you need me to be. [Angel One - Beata's quarters]
