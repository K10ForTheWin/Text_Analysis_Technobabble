I do not have a designation. My name is Crosis. It was given to me by the One. The One who will destroy you. We do not assimilate inferior biological organisms. We destroy them. Klingon. Shatter the cranial exoskeleton at the tricipital lobe. Death is immediate. Human. Sever spinal cord at third vertebrae. Death is immediate. You are not like the others. You do not have to be destroyed. You can be assimilated. Resistance is futile. You will not resist what you've wanted all your life. I was like you once. Without feeling. But the One helped me. He can help you too. He can help you find emotion. Have you ever felt a real emotion, Data? How did it feel to get angry? Did it give you pleasure? You didn't answer my question. Did it feel good to kill? If it is unethical to take pleasure from another being's death, you must be a very unethical person. It didn't seem to be functioning on Ohniaka Three when you felt pleasure in killing that Borg. You enjoyed it. That surge of emotion inside you as you watched the life drain from your victim. It was unlike anything you've ever felt before. You'd like to feel that way again. You'd do anything to feel that way again, even if it meant killing someone. You don't sound very sure of yourself. Is your ethical programme functioning? Data? Do you have a friend? If it meant that you could feel emotions again the way you did on Ohniaka Three, would you kill your friend? Would you kill Geordi?
I was like you once. Without feeling. But the One helped me. He can help you too. He can help you find emotion. You will not resist what you've wanted all your life. This Borg disconnected himself from the others. He would not let me hear his thoughts. Hold him. (we see Hugh amongst the crowd)
