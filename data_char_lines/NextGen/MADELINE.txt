Hi, Dix. You're too much, Dix. You make it sound like you ain't seen me in a year. You got two calls. They're on your desk. Are you kidding? The last time we had a new case, Hitler and Stalin were bosom buddies. The landlord came by. He wants the geetas or he wants you out. The moolah, Dix. The rent. And since we're on the subject, it's been a month since I seen anything. Now I know it's been tough, since you got out of the hospital, but I got responsibilities. It wouldn't hurt. [Hill's office] (Picard takes off his coat and hat, turns on the radio and looks around. The song is 'Let's Get Away From It All, sung by a group that sounds like the Beverly Sisters. He sits down, puts his feet up on the desk and relaxes) [Lwaxana's quarters] There's a gentleman here to see you, Mister Hill. And he doesn't look like a client. There's a gentleman here to see you, Mister Hill. Leaving, Dix? You're not to Rex's bar, are you? It's one of the messages I left on your desk. Me? Have a drink with you? There ain't no why not about it. It's just that this is the first time you ever asked. Not for me, but you'd better take this. (a revolver) Because if we're going to Rex's bar, you're gonna need it. [Rex's Bar] (Mostly empty, Moonlight Serenade playing, ceiling fans turning lazily) Who's going to stop them? Just as long as it isn't us. The last thing America needs to do is fight in another world war. Rye and ginger. (Rex taps the bar and rubs his fingers together. Picard imitates him) He's why I gave you the gun. Jeez, Dix. Cuzzo's the guy who iced Marty O'Farron. They never would have nailed him if it hadn't been for you. Your testimony got him arraigned. You know about my mother's cousin, the girl from San Antonio I told you about? (There's a shadow at the door) Jimmy. (Enter Data in costume, and Riker in uniform) What about Jimmy Cuzzo? You can't leave Rex to face him alone.
Captain Picard? Sorry, there's no Captain Picard here. You should try down at the docks. Ships come
