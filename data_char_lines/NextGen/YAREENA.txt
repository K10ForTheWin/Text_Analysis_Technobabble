Every hospitality will be accorded you. There isn't any need to be concerned, Captain. She's being well cared for. I challenge your right of supercedence! The right is mine and I will have it! Natasha Yar, I challenge you. A struggle to the death. I've agreed to this meeting, but I see no point to it. You've accepted the challenge and there is nothing further to say. And you should know that even though these contests are rare, we have a tradition of making ourselves capable of them. It has everything to do with Lutan. Lutan wants you to be his First One. How could you not love him? Every woman loves him. The truth is I will kill you if I can. And believe me, I can. There is nothing else to say. You are on our world! [Picard's room] And at the instant of death, Lutan, a mating agreement dissolves. Is less painful than the one you selected for me. (She takes the necklace off him) Even as I battled, Hagon, I heard you calling out for me. All my land and all my goods, all I have is yours to rule. (She puts the necklace on Hagon) Do you want him? Then I will have you as my Number Two. Take your place accordingly.
