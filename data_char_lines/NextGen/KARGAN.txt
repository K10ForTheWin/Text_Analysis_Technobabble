This is Captain Kargan of the Klingon vessel, the Pagh. Beam your First Officer on board immediately.
Will you take an oath to that effect? (in Klingon) Speak in their language. This is your Second Officer, Lieutenant Klag. I would say it your first command decision. (Riker looks around and thumps Klag in the stomach before throwing him on the floor, then kicking him down before he can get up again, and finally ramming his head into a computer panel. Lots of sparks. Kargan laughs) [Conspiracy - Quinn's quarters]
