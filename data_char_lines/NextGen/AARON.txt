Governor Delaplane of Pacifica informs us that you cancelled your scheduled stop there. Is this true? Explain yourself, Captain. Why have you returned to Earth? Yes. Delighted. To elaborate upon whatever it is that's troubling you. We'll greet you in the reception area in, say, twenty minutes? You've met Commander Remmick, haven't you? Let's have some Andonian tea while we wait for your Riker. Then you can tell us about what's brought you here. Yes, of course, Captain. The Enterprise is very important to us. To the Horatio, gentlemen. What an awful tragedy. Such a terrible loss of life. Really? Enjoy, Picard. I believe you'll find it an excellent aperitif. [Guest quarters] (Worf and La Forge rush in) What do you know of conspiracies, Captain? That's the charming thing about them, isn't it? When a machination is real, no one knows about it. And when it's suspected, it's almost never real. Wonderful. Bantering with the Captain has given me quite an appetite. Please, sit down, Captain. We've been waiting. Go ahead and start, Captain. We don't stand on ceremony here. (The bowl contains live mealworms. Picard recoils) Oh do eat up, Picard. Raise your hand if you want seconds. (Picard gets up and starts to back out of the room) You were meant for the Doctor. You don't really think we were in the dark about your intentions, do you? More dramatic that way, don't you think? Well said, brother. Picard and Riker control the Enterprise, which means we control the Enterprise.
