Quite some starship you have here, Captain. Look forward to this visit. Wyatt was absolutely right. She is a beauty. Well, we're not really tired, son. Besides, I'd like to see some of the ship. But Homn can't even talk! Untrue! I don't. Keep the chest. You'll have use for it some day. (The Millers beam away, and Lwaxana sweeps in)
