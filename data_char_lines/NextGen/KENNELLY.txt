Well done, Captain. Good. What's the next step? Good. Keep us advised of your progress. A lot better, thank you. Report. All hands lost? Survivors? What are you talking about? This was your idea, Picard? They're terrorists, damn it. Why in the hell would you want to protect them? Do you know how many of our people they killed on Solarion Four? Who told you that? Orta? And you believed him? But then who's responsible? The Cardassians? Why?
