Commander La Forge? (a petite dark lady) I just finished recalibrating the starboard EPS module. It's just like you said. Reset the power tap and the module came right online. You have such a wonderful grasp of engineering principles. I'm learning so much just by being around you. Anything you say. (Tyler goes off with a big smile) Almost done, sir. Excuse me I need the plasma inverter. (she reaches between Geordi and Data, very close, takes the tool and leaves) Captain, we could use an extra hand moving the containment pods. If it wouldn't be an imposition.
