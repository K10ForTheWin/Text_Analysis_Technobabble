I'm Valeda Innis, First Electorine of Haven. Captain Picard? Your presence honours us, and your timing is fortuitous, Captain. An incoming vessel has bypassed our stargate, violating our law. It has refused any attempt at communication. Failure to communicate is inherently hostile. We have no defensive capabilities here and our treaty with the Federation specifies your obligations in that matter. Of course, Captain, but I'm very happy we have you here. [Wyatt's quarters] Captain, the plague ship is approaching transport range. Do you realise that they can turn this lovely world of ours into a graveyard? Please, please take action now before it's too late. Please destroy them now! You must! (transmission ends)
