Out of my way, woman. (Tasha does a neat manoeuvre which takes the box and leaves Hagon face down on the floor) I ask forgiveness. But the female? With us, it is the duty of women only to own the land, and the duty of men to protect and rule it. A force like that cannot possibly come from an image, Lutan. No woman has challenged supercedence for over two hundred years! Lutan, why are you so obsessed with this Lieutenant Yar? Surely Yareena is more desirable? Certainly she can offer you much more. She owns many things, many lands. (Picard enters, and Lutan stops Hagan talking) I see. Great importance, perhaps, but he does (silenced by Lutan) Your weapons, Lieutenant Yar. You may choose your size. (She opens a box containing a glove with metal spikes and a curved blade) I speak for Lutan. The rules are known. Let combat continue until there is a victor. It will not be interrupted. (Yareena goes on the offensive straight away. Tasha pushes her weapon away and it hits one of the vertical laser beams. It flies off Yareena's hand into the lap of a spectator) Careful, Yareena. (Finally the two women get into very close combat, and Tasha lands a blow on Yareena's back. Then she lies across the body and the two are beamed away) [Transporter Room] Remember, you now have all Yareena's lands and wealth now. Yareena, be my First One. Well, as you see, Captain, you may excel in technology, but not in civilised behaviour. [Bridge] (Wesley is still at Ops. Data is standing by Tasha when Picard enters and notices)
