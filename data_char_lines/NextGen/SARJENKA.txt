Is anybody out there? Data. Data, where are you? Why won't you answer? Are you angry me? Please, please, I'm so afraid. Data, Data, where are you? Data. Data, you came. Data, where have you been? We already have. We ran when the tremors began. My father wouldn't let us take anything, but I had to have my transmitter. I knew you would come back, and I didn't want you to find only silence, the way I did. No. What are we going to do? Where are we going? (Data points upwards) To the stars? [Transporter room] Don't leave me here. Please don't leave me. No, Data, no. I'm scared. Don't make me go. No! No. No. Just leave me alone. I want Data. What are you doing? And my parents and brothers? You did this for me? You have many different kinds of people here. When I am bigger, can I be on your ship? I wish I could come with you now. I know, but I can still wish for it. [Pulaski's office] Hello. (She picks up a brown and white stone from the desk) What is this? What does it sing for you? Why not?
