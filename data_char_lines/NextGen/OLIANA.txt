(a young red-head) What is it? The unit you just put down. Don't worry. I won't tell anyone. I'm Oliana Mirren, one of the other finalists. You must be Wesley Crusher. I heard there was a very smart, very young man who'd be tough competition. I weren't smart. I know. But there's a lot more to it than just that. You're lucky. You've had practical experience aboard the Enterprise. (Other young people enter) Happy birthday. You don't know how lucky you are. I can't imagine what it would be like to have things come so easily. I have to push every step of the way. It's a good thing you're cute, Wesley, or you could really be obnoxious. See you later. (Oliana leaves) Well, personally, I hate losing. So you'd better be ready next year, Wesley. I won't be easy to beat. [Corridor] (Picard is in dress uniform when he meets an embarrassed Jake)
