I am Commander Tebok. Silence your dog, Captain. Once we realised the level of destruction, we knew it could not have been you. We do not know who is responsible. Why entire outposts on both sides have been carried off. Captain Picard, because your actions are those of a thoughtful man, I'll you this. Matters more urgent caused our absence. Now, witness the result. Outposts destroyed, expansion of the Federation everywhere. Yes, we have indeed been negligent, Captain. But no more. Your presence is not wanted. Do you understand my meaning, Captain? We are back. (Transmission ends)
