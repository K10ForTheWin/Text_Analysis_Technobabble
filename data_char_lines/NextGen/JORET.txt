It will not be easy. The border is heavily guarded. If a patrol stops me, I will claim to have stolen it. If I were alone, the chances of my succeeding would be slim. But if I had a prisoner with me, a Bajoran terrorist, I would appear to be a bounty hunter. Border crossings of that nature are not uncommon, and for a price the patrol can be convinced to look the other way. I didn't realise she would be so young. [Shuttlebay] We are approaching the border. It won't be long before we're detected by the patrol ships. No. It should seem that I've broken your will. If you're asked any questions, look at me as though you're afraid to answer. I don't consider myself a traitor, if that's what you're asking. All my life I've served in the military. Once it was an institution dedicated to the security of Cardassia, now it's little more than a platform for ambitious Guls hoping to make their reputations in battle. If the information I provided helps Starfleet deter even one pointless skirmish, I've served my purpose. I'm sick of war. My people need peace. And I never thought a Bajoran would risk her life to help a Cardassian get home. We don't have much time. (he shackles her wrists) [Ten Forward]
