Sure. Aye, sir.
Easy, sir, easy. I've got you.
Finished. Just waiting to insert the modules. [Bridge]
Captain, I am detecting some unusual fluctuations in subspace frequencies.
He's up there!
Well we're sitting here now. Really? Funny, I don't see your name on it.
Commander.
I guess these are my quarters, but I don't remember anything. Okay, sir. Thanks.
Stand by for transport. (Crusher and Garrett are beamed away)
Attempting to lock on, sir. [Ten Forward] Bridge, the entire transporter array has been taken off line and placed into diagnostic mode. [Bridge]
Sir. (Riker gets to Deanna's door. She's not in uniform)
It hurts! It hurts! Please!
What? (She guns him down while the woman runs back round a corner) [Bridge]
We're infected with something. Lieutenant Kelly tried to reprogram the biofilter
Aye, sir.
Yes, sir. [Cargo bay] (it's a lot brighter in here)
Captain. (The crewman goes round the corner, there's no one else in sight, so Picard rings a doorbell)
Aye, sir.
Commander! Look!
Commander, is that what you wanted?  Commander, what happened?  Yes, Doctor. 
Here, let me help up.
We have a green panel, sir. [Science lab] No life forms present.
Channel open, sir. Channel closed.
Captain! Captain, we need help. Don't you see what's following us? (They carry on running) (Picard passes an open door and sees a ballerina in a golden tutu pirouetting) How? Yes, sir. Captain's log. Any time entry is meaningless. We have no choice but to repeat the same warp experiment. but wish one variation. A principal part of this warp formula will be the thoughts of everyone aboard the Enterprise. We have no idea exactly how this works. We understand only that the Traveller makes use of this somehow. It will be most important that those aboard avoid random thoughts that might change the reality of what we're attempting to do. [Bridge]
Aye, sir.
Shields down to twenty seven percent. (Riker is knocked down by more hits to the ship, and a Romulan helps him back up)
(at Worf's station) Can I help you, sir?
Standing by, Commander. [Bridge] Aye, sir. Door did not respond. [Bridge]
Hurray for the acting Captain! (The entire Engineering crew are out of their skulls)
