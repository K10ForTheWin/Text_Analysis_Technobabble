Aye, sir. Aye sir. Verifying sensor calibration. EPS mains holding stable. Sensor array online. Yes, sir. On our way, sir. [Bridge] Take a look at this. (there's a glow in the middle of the bay, and the bit on the wall is brighter too.) Graviton emitters at full power, sir. Standing by. Ready, Commander. [Alien lab] (Now there are four aliens fussing around a control panel) [Cargo bay] Ready. [Alien lab] (Riker sneaks over to Rager, and uses a phaser to stun an alien) [Engineering] Emitters recharging. [Alien lab] (Riker picks up Rager and dashes through the rupture into) [Cargo bay] (the rupture turns into a blue streak which whizzes around then flies out into space) Captain's log, stardate 46191.2. The tetryon emissions in cargo bay four have ceased, and there have been no further indications of alien intrusions. All Enterprise crewmembers are safe and accounted for. But we are still left with some unanswered questions. [Observation lounge]
