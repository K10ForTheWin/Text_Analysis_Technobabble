Jean-Luc! It is so good to finally meet you. How are you feeling? Well, Robert and I are delighted that you've come to stay with us. I wouldn't hear of it. It's your home and it will always be your home. Do things look that different? (Mock Tudor Nouveau, with first floor protruding over the ground floor, tall brick chimney stacks) Robert's worked hard to keep it that way. It's very important to him. Robert can't wait to see you. As usual, with his vines. [Vineyard] (Robert is tasting the red grapes, making sure they are all right) Your friend Louis wants you to contact him as soon as you're settled. Oh yes, he's very excited about it. He's been made a supervisor now, as his wife is constantly reminding anyone who'll listen. The Mayor wants to give you a parade. Give you the keys to the city. Well, I've already warned the Mayor not to make any plans without talking to us. Thank you. Robert and I have had more than a few discussions about getting a replicator in the house. This is a very old argument. And he won a ribbon for it. Why don't you go and get it, and then you can read it to your uncle. (Rene leaves the table) Jean Luc? Are you all right? Why shouldn't you? Considering what you've just been through Besides, it would be wonderful to have you back home. Given a little time, maybe you and your brother might even get to like one another. You're not like part of the family. You are part of the family, Jean Luc Picard. (The door bell has chimed) Louis, come in. Let me get you some wine. You can talk business. What in the world? What happened here? Have you two been fighting? Shame on you both. What would your father say if he saw you like this? Well, perhaps it's just as well you got it out of your systems. Already, Jean-Luc? Come back and see us again. Goodbye, Jean-Luc. And be careful. He's still out there. Dreaming about starships and adventures. It's getting late.
