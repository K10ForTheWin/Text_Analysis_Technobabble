Quite a ship you have. I don't usually see them in such good condition. By the time they get to me, they're always falling apart. Who are you? He probably figures that we don't get to see a lot of handsome women out this way and someone like you might get a little more cooperation from me. He's probably right. What was the name of that ship? The T'Pau? (goes to science station) The T'Pau. Vulcan registry. There. Logged in stardate 41334. Docked. Section eighteen gamma twelve. Do you want me to take you there? Helmsman, lay in a heading one four one by two zero eight. Ahead slow, two hundred kph. I suppose this is your first visit to a junkyard, isn't it? You'd be surprised at some of the things I find on board these ships. I once found a fourteen foot Caldorian eel on board a freighter, in someone's locker. If you have time, I'll show it to you. I still have it. Nursed her back to health. What? Where is it? What happened to it? These are the correct coordinates. The T'Pau is missing. I'm not accustomed to losing things, Commander. I will find your ship for you. I have the T'Pau cross-referenced in four different directories. Of course. It was routed to the Tripoli, a holding vessel on the outer rim of the shipyard. How can that be? In all the time that the Zakdorn have operated this depot, nothing has ever been lost. Never. I do not understand this. This is not possible. We beam goods to the Tripoli on a regular schedule. There was a shipment yesterday. Another is set for today. It must be there. Just over two hours from now. A shipment of deuterium storage tanks. He's taking the position assigned to the Tripoli. The coordinates are identical.
