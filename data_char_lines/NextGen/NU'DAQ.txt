Pah! A ridiculous story. Scientific research. As if we fear Cardassian threats. Yes. And there will be no other samples from Indri Eight. There is no secret. It is an ancient weapon design of incredible power. And the Klingon Empire will not allow it to fall into an enemy's hands. Or even a friend's. Biscuits? If that is what you believe, then go back to Cardassia. I will send you my mother's recipe. And if we refuse? Excellent. (Ocett adds her data, and it looks a good three quarters done) Pahk! We have surrendered what we had for nothing. How can that be? We have no idea where to start looking for the missing DNA fragment. I intend to. [Ten Forward] (Data is at a table, reading a PADD) Good evening, Commander Data. Is there any word yet on the missing fragment? Commander, your reputation for physical strength is known even in the Klingon Empire. You are familiar with the B'aht Qul challenge? Wa' Cha' Wej (Data instantly pushes Nu'Daq's arms back onto the table, and returns to his PADD) Maw' tok! (Nu'Daq head-butts Data, but falls backwards himself) I understand your intellectual prowess is equally impressive. If I were to learn of the results from the computer search before the others, the Klingon Empire would have a strategic advantage. A being of your abilities would go far in the Empire. Not at all. Commander, never mind. [Engineering] (a display is beeping) It is fortunate that your Engineer discovered Gul Ocett's attempt to tamper with your defensive systems. Maht-H'a. Status. What? You incompetent Top'a. You were supposed to be prepared. I will go with you. You dishonorable top'a! How? Etched in stone, no doubt. No deals. There will be no deals as long as I'm still alive. We die together, Brother. Tash Koh Tah. That's all? If she were not dead, I would kill her.
