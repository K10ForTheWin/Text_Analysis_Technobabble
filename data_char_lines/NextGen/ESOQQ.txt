Who has done this? I don't trust you. You know my planet? My given name is Esoqq. It means fighter. Mizarians. Your names all mean surrender. A race of cowards. And you? I don't know your people. Who would want to imprison a child? There are Chalnoth who would kill me if they could. But kidnap? There is no reason. None of consequence. I've slain all the ones who mattered. That shocks you, Bolian? And you? The Chalnoth have no use for laws or governments! We are strong. We obey no one. And you may be the first. What is this? The only food? Poison! You. Three days. Perhaps four. No longer. [Doctor's office] Not very sturdy. Not to you. You moved far from the door. You claim you were hit by the stun beam before the rest of us arrived. You could be lying. Maybe our enemy is watching us from inside. Collaboration is what your species does best. For all we know, you may be our captor. How can we be sure you're a Mizarian? You could be an impostor. Keep talking and I will use it. Why should we believe you? And how do we know this is the heroic Captain Picard? We have no proof of his identity. The sound of your voice is beginning to anger me. How do you know? Replicas?
