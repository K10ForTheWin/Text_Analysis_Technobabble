Who are you? I want Jameson. This charade will accomplish nothing, Picard. Beam down Jameson, and the hostages will be freed. Continue this and I promise you they will die. And you with them. Peretor was my old title. Why do you call me that? I warn you, Picard. This trick is going too far. He has been coached for some devious reason. If this farce does not stopped immediately, you and the hostages will be put to death. (Jameson doubles up in pain) I am waiting for an explanation, Captain. This story you are telling is unbelievable. Jameson is a man of more than eighty years, not this. I want that old man, Picard. I want to show him this world he helped to make. The scars on old soldiers' bodies. The graveyards of our young dead. The wasted cities we are still rebuilding. And all of it caused by him. But Jameson didn't give weapons to only us. If he had, we would have quickly triumphed over our enemies, and there would have been peace in all these decades. I want him to pay for that, Picard. You're wasting my time, Picard. Yes. Yes. This is the man I want. Jameson has to pay for his crimes. I have sworn it to my people. No. I don't believe you. You're shielding Jameson on the ship and you're telling me this tale to save his life. Jameson told you this. If it is you, show me the scar. (Jameson shows his wrist) It is you. Somehow it is you. (takes a gun from the wall) Then die by your own weapon! No. No, my revenge will be in seeing you live like this. Such pain. Rest, Jameson. Your long night, and mine, are over. The hostages will be freed immediately, Captain. I'm prepared to be cooperative. [Bridge]
