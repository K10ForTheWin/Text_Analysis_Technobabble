Why are you so alarmed when I've gone to such trouble to look just like you? Nagilum. Data. You are of different construction than the others. Interesting. Picard, Riker, Geordi, Haskell. What are you? Your construction also differs. (Pulaski is suddenly whipped around like a puppet on a string) I understand. The masculine and the feminine. Please, demonstrate how this is accomplished. Your life form surprises me more and more. Is it true you also have only a limited existence? Answer! You exist and then you cease to exist. Your minds call it death. (Haskell starts to shake, holds his head and screams before suffering the fate usually reserved for red shirts) How interesting. To understand death, I must amass information on every aspect of it. Every kind of dying. The experiments shouldn't take more than a third of your crew, maybe half. Captain's log, Stardate 42194.7. It is obvious that whatever we have met sees no value in our kind of life form. How do we fight something that both is and is not there? [Observation lounge] You have provided me with much more than I needed. It wasn't necessary. I have learned all I needed to know. Would you like me to share some of my conclusions? Of course you are. You are too inquisitive not to want to know. You seem to find no tranquillity in anything. You struggle against the inevitable. You thrive on conflict. You are selfish, yet you value loyalty. You are rash, quick to judge, slow to change. It's amazing you've survived. Be that as it may, as species, we have no common ground. You are too aggressive. Too hostile. Too militant. Oh? The point is well taken, Captain. Perhaps that is a trait we share.
