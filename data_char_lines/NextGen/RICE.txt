Hello. Commander Riker. I was over there. How are you, Commander Riker? How many are with you? I was injured getting here. (Tasha and Data arrive) No. What's your purpose here? Riker, you didn't answer me. Who sent you here to look for me? Tell me about your ship, Riker. It's the Enterprise, isn't it? I have no knowledge of that ship. Refresh me, would you, Riker? What's its size, it's complement? What's the armament on the Lollipop? We're friends, aren't we? Our top speed is warp three. What's yours? The Drake? Of course, my ship is the Drake. Classified. Please, it's important. Our survival depends on knowing. What's the armament on your ship? Ten? I don't understand. Ten what? Commander Riker, your answers make no sense.
