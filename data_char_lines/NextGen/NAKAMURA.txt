Captain Picard? Captain Louvois. You're acquainted with Captain Picard? Captain, it's good to see you again. May I present Commander Bruce Maddox. He has an interesting proposal for you, but that can wait for a while. I'm eager to see the Enterprise. As you know, we've had disturbing news from both sides of the zone. We're here to respond when needed. And it won't hurt to have the Romulans know that we're nearby. Well, Captain, I want to thank you for this opportunity. For five hundred years every ship that has borne the name of the Enterprise has been a legend. This one is no different. Oh yes, Captain. Commander Maddox is here to do some work on your android. Please take care of him. (Nakamura leaves)
Let me guess. Your new warp core is malfunctioning again? Are you expecting to have this problem fixed soon, or shall we send out a tow ship to bring you in?
Captain. I am initiating a fleet-wide Yellow Alert. Starfleet intelligence has picked up some alarming reports from the Romulan Empire. It appears that at least thirty Warbirds have been pulled from other assignments and are headed for the Neutral Zone. Our operatives on Romulus have indicated that there appears to be something happening in the Neutral Zone, specifically in the Devron System. Our own long range scans have picked up some kind of spatial anomaly in the area. We can't tell what it is. This is a very delicate situation. I am deploying fifteen starships along our side of the Neutral Zone. I want you to go there as well. See if you can find out what is going on in the Devron System. Not yet. Wait and see what the Romulans do. You can conduct long range scans, send probes if necessary, but do not cross the border unless they do. Starfleet out. [Future Vineyard]
