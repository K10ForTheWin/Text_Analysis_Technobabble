Brull, you traitor! You have led them here to destroy me! And what is that? I don't wish to listen to either of you. You may sit. You know, Picard, I could take you prisoner. Oh, don't worry, I've no intention of doing so. I know what trouble it's been for you to get here, and I am curious why. Amnesty? You mean slavery. I don't. Say what you came to say, though I doubt that I'm going to believe you. No! You have spent a century hunting us down. Yes, by luring us back and putting us in prison. Will you feed and clothe us, too? Land? Do we look like farmers to you? We will need autonomy. Yes, and those rights will be spelled out before I agree to anything. [Bridge] If we're going to be subject to your laws, we want a part in making it. Unacceptable. The real power is in the council. You're shutting us off already. I don't care what others have. I agree. Maybe a little touch of that brandy? That's ridiculous. We have nothing in common at all. We haven't agreed to anything. A Federation trap! Penthar-Mul? How do you know Penthar-Mul? Who are you? There are no more Tralestas. You will never leave this ship alive. Commander, I am in your debt. [Ten Forward] (Picard enters, and is handed a PADD)
