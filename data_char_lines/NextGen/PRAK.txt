We detected what appeared to be a Federation signal buoy. When we approached it, it emitted a massive verteron pulse. Our warp drive, our sensors, our communications systems were all disabled. We assumed we were the victims of a new Federation weapon. We passed a Federation ship several days ago. It did not appear to be in any distress. It is possible that information was recorded in our sensor logs, Commander. Unfortunately, my entire crew is occupied with our repairs. I don't think there will be time to search our records. I believe it would, Captain. [Data's quarters] (Spot is sitting on the computer console)
