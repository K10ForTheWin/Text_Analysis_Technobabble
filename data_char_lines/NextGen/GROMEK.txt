Greetings, Captain Picard. Captain, you will soon be joined by a Federation special emissary from Starbase One Five Three. We Are now transmitting the specifics. The rendezvous will be a bit tricky, so it is imperative you reach the intercept point on schedule. The envoy will fill you in. You are to cooperate fully. Negative. I sympathise, Jean-Luc, but Starfleet Command considers this a top security matter. Once the envoy has briefed you, I think you will understand our caution. Gromek out.
