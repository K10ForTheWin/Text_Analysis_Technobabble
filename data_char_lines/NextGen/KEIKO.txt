Thank you. (Miles and Keiko embrace) Every night, Miles leaves his socks on the floor. When we got married, I made the mistake of picking them up a few times. Then I realised, if I kept it up I'd be doing it the rest of my life. So I stopped, figuring he'd get the point and do it himself. One night goes by, two, a week, ten days. By now there's a pile of socks half a metre high. After two weeks I couldn't stand it any more. I bundled them up and put them in the cleaning processor. And I'm still doing it.
Boy, what a day this was. I'm doing an isozyme study on some populations of Cardilia but they're turning out to have these really weird polymorphisms. What a headache! Oh, no, I had a conference with Doctor Balthus. She wants to do a study on the laticifer ontogeny of the Kaladian Thorn Flower, but I don't have time to oversee another project. What? Of course I remember him, but Miles, what are you saying? If I didn't know better, I'd say you were jealous.
It's a chipped cup, off-white, with a crack in it. I can see it but I don't remember anything else about it. No, I don't think so. Wait, yes. Humming. Someone's humming. Yes, but I don't know who it is. It has a sharp edge where it's chipped. A liquid, dark. It's not hot. It's bitter. Yes, a wooden handle. No, it's more delicate than that. A brush. An ink brush. I hear that humming again. It's Obaachan! My grandmother. She's doing ink brush writing. I can remember it now. She used that cup for cleaning the brushes, and it was my job to fill it with water and bring it to the table. I would sit beside her and watch the most beautiful characters come from that brush. And the whole time, she'd be humming to herself. I remember it like it was yesterday. For years I've seen that old cup in my memory but I could never remember what it was or why it was important. Thank you. It's getting late. I'd better be going. (they all leave, except Jev the son) [Corridor] I'm happy to help. No, nothing like that. It was a wonderful experience. Is that good?
Shh. Momma's here. Shh. (Troi, O'Brien and Data enter, brandishing their phasers) Miles? She's frightened. Why don't you just let us go? Please don't. Don't. No! Get away! Get away from me. Please, let her stay. (Miles lets Keiko hand Molly over to the woman again) I would die to save the life of my child. I'm just glad to have you back. I know. We both know. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Wait a minute. We decided on Hiro, after my father. That's right, and we decided on Hiro. It's all right. He's just doing somersaults. Here, feel. (She puts Riker's hand on her bump) Right there. Sure. There, feel it? When he's not turning, he's kicking and punching. When I want to sleep, he wants to wake up. At this point, I just wish it were over. Okay. A little foggy. Okay. There that should do it. I'm all right. I think. Oh, oh, oh. I'm having contractions. No, I mean contractions. I'm going into labour. It's not open for debate. Like it or not, this baby is coming. [Observation lounge] (Troi is getting the Worst Case Scenario briefing) That's easy for you to say. Worf, has the baby turned? So the head is down. Doctor Crusher told me a few days ago that it hadn't. She wasn't worried because I still had a month to go. Worf, have you ever done this before?, delivered a baby? Sometimes it doesn't go by the book, Worf. That's what I've been doing. I don't know. I don't think it's up to me. It happens when it happens. Well, I'm sorry! I am pushing! Okay. Hello. You were wonderful, Worf. I couldn't have done it without you. Hello. Captain's log, supplemental. We are en route to Starbase sixty seven, to undergo repairs. Life aboard the Enterprise is slowly returning to normal. [Bridge] (Troi leads the children onto the Bridge)
Actually, it's a Draebidium calimus. You can tell by the shape of the leaves. I didn't know you were interested in plant biology.
Come in. I know. Data, I've decided not to go through with it. No, I'm calling off the wedding. It's just the right thing to do. I'm supposed to be getting married, Data. I should be happy, but I'm not. I just feel this weight pressing down on me. Yes. He'll probably be just as relieved as I am. Data, you introduced us to each other. You mean a lot to both of us. I would really appreciate it if you would tell Miles for me. What? What do you mean? Well Data, it's not that simple. I knew what I was doing. It's my decision. I did what I had to! Why are you doing this? I thought you were my friend. Then leave me alone. Just leave me alone. You haven't offended me. It would be best if you got dressed. For the wedding? Come here. I have the most beautiful carnation for the father of the bride. Now, don't be nervous.
Kelp buds, plankton loaf and sea berries. It's very healthy. I had this every morning when I was growing up. For breakfast? What kind of foods? Kind of heavy. She cooked? She handled real meat? She touched it and cut it? Okay. Maybe I'll have something special for you, tonight, too. (weapons fire) What's that you're singing? What's it about? I imagine that's to be expected. Sure. The war lasted a long time. That takes its toll on people. What are these little dark things? You fought the Cardassians, didn't you? Well, how do you feel about them?
