Hi, Dad. (a little later, the lad is looking for something) and then Mister Greenburg asked about the Fornax Disaster, and I knew the Enterprise saved all the colonists. But I didn't know. (spots the PADD) Here it is. But I didn't know the exact stardate their sun went nova, so of you tell me, I'll write it down and that way I won't forget. You don't remember me, do you? Pretty bad, huh? I've been practicing but I still can't get a good tone. Dad? Is that what you wanted? Sure. Dad. Everything's going to be fine. [Corridor] Dad. I'm fine. I was in the gym playing parrises squares. I fell off the ramp. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Deck eight. It's okay, Dad. Scared? You? You never have, Dad. You've always been there for me. The Curtis Creek programme? Sure. We've gone to Curtis Creek lots of times. You bet. Great! [Riker's quarters] And then Mom tried to net the fish, and she fell in the creek, too. And then you tried to pull us both out, and you fell in. Mom really liked Curtis Creek. We went there for picnics and stuff lots of times. She was great. I think of her a lot. I'd better go change. What's wrong, Dad? But I know Mom's pictures are there. Did you give a stardate? Computer. Display family record. Riker, Mrs. William T. Home file. Stardate 58416. (a movie of J-L's 7th birthday, and the woman is a brunette last seen in a season one episode...) Mom was beautiful, wasn't she? What's wrong, Dad?
