Thank you for receiving us, Captain. And who was it who spoke for Alpha so long ago? And how did you manage to achieve a compromise between that young man and the iron willed woman of Beta Moon? Nothing that you have said is beyond what a school child could learn in a history book. It is true. I will consider it, but I must consult others. You shall have it. [Sickbay]
