I didn't. It must be a mistake. I know nothing about it. No. I was not involved. You accuse me because I am Klingon. Send me home, then, if you are so distrusting. I have nothing more to say. On the Klingon Home World your name is not mentioned. It is as though you never existed. A terrible burden for a warrior to bear, to become nothing, to be without honour, without the chance for glory. [Corridor] I have friends, powerful friends, on the homeworld. I could talk to them. They might help to restore your name, if you could just take me to a shuttlecraft. [J'Dan's quarters] It could be done without any one knowing about it. (Worf hits J'Dan) Pahtk! That proves nothing. I take injections. Everyone knows that. The blood of all Klingons has become water. Since the Federation alliance we have turned into a nation of mewling babies. Romulans are strong. They are worthy allies. They do not turn Klingons into weaklings like you. I had nothing to do with that I do not know. I had nothing to do with it. I am not lying.
