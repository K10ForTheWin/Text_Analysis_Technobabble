Is the shuttle still there? Then perhaps our crew has survived. Commander, we're grateful for your help. Whatever resources we can provide are yours. (the council members leave) You are aware of the charges against you? Do you intend to dispute them? Well? What is your response? (Riker enters) Commander Riker, these proceedings are closed to everyone. Sir, this is a private matter. We are grateful for your recent help, but that gives you no right to interfere with our personal concerns. Is this true? I congratulate you, Soren. Your decision to admit your perversion makes it much more likely that we can help you. Commander? Commander, after Soren's diatribe, you must think that we are a cruel, repressive people. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are concerned about our citizens. We take our obligations to them seriously. Soren is sick, and sick people want to get well. You don't understand. We have a very high success rate in treating deviants like this. And without exception, they become happier people after their treatment, and grateful that we care enough to cure them. You see, Commander, on this world, everyone wants to be normal. Take Soren to quarters. Treatment will begin tomorrow. No more, Commander.
