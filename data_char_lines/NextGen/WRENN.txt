My name is Wrenn, and before I enquire why your tractor beam has trapped us here, is there one aboard your vessel named Wyatt? (Crusher and Wyatt enter. He has his drawings with him) It's astounding. Ariana was right. He is here, daughter. Oh, we still carry it, Captain. My daughter, I, all eight of us. All of us that are left, Captain. Most of the rest passed on during the years that it took to reach Haven. We don't ask to make contact with those living below. All we ask is to be on the edge of some sea, some unpopulated island, a faraway peninsula. Present the fact we intend to die here, Captain. And if we die while caged by your tractor beam, so be it. [Lwaxana's quarters] Hello, Wyatt. We always thought you were a dream. Once we saw you were real, we knew. You are a doctor? You may turn off your tractor beam, Captain. We will not be going to Haven. We have what we really came for. Captain, my respects.
