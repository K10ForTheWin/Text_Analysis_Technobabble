Are my parents alright? Captain's log, supplemental. A young boy, shielded from our initial sensor scans, has been discovered pinned beneath a fallen beam. The degree of damage to the Vico is making our rescue attempt difficult. [Bridge] Are you're going to lift that? How come you can pick up something so heavy? We were in the Black Cluster. I don't know where they came from. They had a big ship and they kept shooting at us. Then they beamed over. They had purple helmets on and phaser rifles. I saw them. They didn't see me. It's not finished. (putting a portico on a model building) But it's not finished. (the worried teacher casts a glance towards Troi watching through the window) [Bridge] (at the science station) What? (Data enters) Data. Yeah. Isn't it great?! See, there's the big hallway the teacher told us about. That's where everybody came in. That's where they stood. And that's where the altar was. What do you think? You hate it. I can't do anything right. I told you. Incredible. Data, how come you can do that? Androids are better than humans? No emotions? You mean you can't be happy or sad? Why not? Data! Can we build something else later? Bye. [Timothy's quarters] (looking in the mirror) I am designed to exceed human capacity. tilts head) That is correct. [Observation lounge] Yes, Counsellor. I am ready. I am functioning within established parameters. I am an android. That would be acceptable. [Ten Forward] Androids do not need to eat or drink. (spots a dessert being carried by a waiter) However, sometimes we like to taste things. A Tamarin frost, please. Would you like anything, Counsellor? As you wish. I'm an android. I've always been an android. I am designed to exceed human capacity, both mentally and physically. But I do not experience emotions. That is correct. [Ready room] (Data is included in the meeting) But you do it. I like it. Data, are there any other androids in Starfleet? How come you're not Captain? Data, what's the scariest thing that ever happened to you? Because it's an emotion? But what if you had a nightmare? I do not require sleep. It's perfect. [Sickbay] Within established parameters? I ran out of red ochre. Thank you. (yawns) I'm fine. The servo mechanisms in my mouth are designed to approximate human movements. (Data tries a yawn) That is not bad. Thank you. It's just a painting. I understand. This is great. How is yours? But how does it taste? Is it good? Oh. I didn't realise that. You sound like you don't want to be an android. But if you could change, would you? Why? We're stronger and smarter than humans. We can do more than they can. But we never have to feel bad, either. I did tell you. We were attacked. We were attacked! We were attacked! It was me. It was me. I did it. I killed them all. Everything was shaking. I lost my balance. I was just trying to hold on to something. I didn't mean to do it. My arm hit the computer panel. That's what destroyed the ship. Yes it was. But if it wasn't me That's just how it was when it started on the Vico. [Bridge] We couldn't get out either. No. That's what they kept saying. More shields, more shields. I don't know. Just that. Just more shields. Warp power to the shields. They said that too, Data. I'm positive. Hi, Data. How are you? I miss my parents. But I'm okay. I guess you thought I was pretty silly when I had my hair like yours and everything. Can we still do things together, even if I'm not really an android? That would be acceptable. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.
