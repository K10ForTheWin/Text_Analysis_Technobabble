Father. I see. Father, come home. This is wrong. There's nothing for me to look at. It is irrelevant. All I'm concerned with now is you, not your work. Your work is over. It is your time to rest. My father taught me to cherish The Resolution. I don't know how you have poisoned him to reject it. How dare you. How dare you criticize my way of life, my beliefs. Where will you go? And where will you die? I cannot bear the thought of you being laid to rest on some other world. That you will not lie beside my mother. That I will not be able to lie beside you when my Resolution comes. I'm sorry. I don't know how you can go on with your life knowing that each day you live is an insult to everything we believe in. Father, I love you. But I am ashamed. (Dara leaves)
