Okona, you are without shame. No, he's coming with me. Captain, my complaint was registered first. You dare call my daughter a liar? It's not up to you, or to Okona. I've been dishonoured. I will decide. You said it was Okona's. Then you'll marry Okona. No, no, no, no no. You'll live on Atlec. Your grandson?
