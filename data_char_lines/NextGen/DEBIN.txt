Federation vessel, you have no rights in this solar system. I am Debin of planet Atlec, ordering you to heave to and prepare to be boarded. Enterprise, you are towing a spacecraft of a known criminal. You have a man aboard by the name of Okona. I want him. He is guilty of crimes committed on the planet Atlec. I expect him to be turned over to my authority immediately. Neither important nor necessary. I want Okona now! That is not your concern. All right, you want to know what he did? You want to know why I have chased him across this system? All right. Here, This is his crime. (He goes off screen and returns leading a very pregnant young woman) He dishonoured my daughter. He took advantage of her, then he ran off and left her carrying his bastard child. He'll return, and he'll do the right thing or I'll hunt him to the ends of the galaxy. Captain's log, supplemental. Some of the mystery surrounding this ancient morality play we've been dragged into has been revealed. One of Captain Okona's pursuers is an outraged father with a heartfelt, if arcane, sense of righteousness. [Bridge] My purpose is not your concern. A thing. An item. My case involves the victimisation of my daughter, and my honour. I'll have Okona now. He used my daughter. Agreed. Okona, you are without shame. No, he's coming with me. Captain, my complaint was registered first. You dare call my daughter a liar? It's not up to you, or to Okona. I've been dishonoured. I will decide. You said it was Okona's. Then you'll marry Okona. No, no, no, no no. You'll live on Atlec. Your grandson?
