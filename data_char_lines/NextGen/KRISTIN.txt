I'm afraid so. What do you think? Something like that. Good. Same thing. Only that time, I flattened out when I should have tucked. Well, that helps a lot. This hurts. (Crusher treats her arm) Thanks. But what about me? I mean, I'm a patient in a bathing suit. That doesn't say much. Do you have any clothes around here I could borrow? At least until I figure out where the swimming pool is? [Bridge] (everyone is working at the rear stations except Worf, who is in the Captain's chair)
