Captain, what this man has been telling you is full of half-truths. He's a prisoner. What do you expect him to say about us? The soldiers were resettled on Lunar Five. It was to be their colony. It was for their own protection as well as that of others. Most of them were quite happy there. We went to great lengths to give them a fine quality of life. Unfortunately, a few agitators like Danar forced us to add security. Captain, I assure you that every alternative has been explored. And this discussion is now treading upon matters of internal security, which is not your concern. I have dispatched a ship to rendezvous with you to transport the prisoner back to Lunar Five. On behalf of Angosia, I thank the Federation for its assistance in retrieving our citizen. (Transmission ends)
