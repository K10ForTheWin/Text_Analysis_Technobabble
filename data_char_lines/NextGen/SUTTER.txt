Honey, I think it's time for you to go. You don't want to keep Keiko waiting. You go ahead, sweetie, and be home for dinner. I'm just afraid she's not making any real friends. She spends all of her time with Isabella. You're probably right. Why don't we call it Sutter's Cloud? Aye, sir. What was that? Systems are normal, sir. Clara, you can't be here right now. I don't care what Isabella wanted to see, you go back to our quarters right now. Clara, now. (Clara leaves) I'm sorry, Commander. [Corridor] (Isabella appears) I'm setting the fractionater to a continuous cycle. Commander, I understand that you had a parent who was in Starfleet. They must have been posted to a lot of different assignments. Was that hard on you? It must have been disruptive if you didn't stay in one place long enough to make friends. Thanks, Commander. [Ten Forward] (Data and Guinan are looking at the nebula) She came into Engineering today. She said it was Isabella's idea. I think she'd like that. Counsellor, thank you. [Clara's bedroom] (Clara is doing a puzzle while Isabella just sits holding a teddy bear) We figure it's a segment of just part of a network of much larger strands. Would you come to my quarters? I'm having a problem with Clara. [Ten Forward] She won't even go into her room. She's terrified that Isabella's going to hurt her. Captain, Clara has told me that her imaginary friend has been making threats. She claimed that others were on the way and that they had plans to kill everyone on the ship. What about her, Clara? Did she say when the others were coming? (shakes head) All right, thanks, sweetie. You go back to bed now. We'll handle this.
