(a Vulcan lady played by Susie Plaxton) What symptoms have you noticed? I am a doctor. Lieutenant Selar. I've checked twice to make certain. You have Darnay's disease. I'm sorry, Doctor Graves. It's in it's final stage. In all cases, Darnay's is terminal. Captain's log, Stardate 42437.7. We've successfully repaired the stricken liner, Constantinople. Forty six of her people suffered injuries, mostly minor. They have been treated and supplied with the proper medicines. Our task complete, we are heading back to Gravesworld with great dispatch. [Graves' laboratory] (Graves is whistling 'If I only had a heart' from the Wizard of Oz in between coughing at his desk) I'd say he has a week, but that's only an estimate. We do know that the disease attacks the brain and nervous system. We can expect more of the erratic behaviour of the kind you've been noticing. I do not wish to interrupt Data and the Doctor. They seem to have developed a genuine rapport. But the Enterprise has reached it's orbit and I'd like to transport Graves to the ship as soon as possible. (Data enters) They were together practically the entire time we were on the planet. He seemed brilliant, egocentric, arrogant, chauvinistic.
