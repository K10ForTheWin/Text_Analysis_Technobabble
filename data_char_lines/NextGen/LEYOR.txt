Madame. You must think Caldonia very insular, Mister Ral. Go on, please. Yes, I must admit, I have begun to feel some trepidation about that. Madame Bhavani, Caldonia withdraws from these proceedings. It has been made very clear that the maintenance and administrative requirements are beyond our abilities. My apologies. We have already reached an agreement with the Chrysalians. (Leyor leaves)
