The Enterprise? Yes. We had a forced chamber explosion in the resonator coil. The Captain is dead. I'm the science officer. Mirok. All right. Pressure in the containment chamber has increased fifteen melakols in the last two minutes. Most of the conduits were damaged during the explosion. I can't even access the central computer. The pressure has jumped two hundred melakols! It's going to implode. Yes, but it's not functioning. I'll have to do it manually. I'm ready, Commander. Implosion in five seconds) Yes. [Bridge] We're ready, Commander. The power flow is consistent at four hundred kolems. No fluctuations in frequency. The main power grid is online. I'm afraid I fail to see the point of this investigation, Commander. All of our systems were damaged, including the cloaking device. You can be assured that the emissions will be eliminated before the engine core is replaced. Is their power transfer beam still at full intensity? We will set up a muon feedback wave inside the transfer beam. The particles will accumulate in their dilithium chamber. When they go to warp speed, their engines will explode.
