(a lady Admiral of African descent) None of which is our concern, Jean-Luc. The Klingon civil war is, by definition, an internal matter of the Empire. Some would call it good leadership. What is it you propose, Captain? A blockade. But how would you overcome the Romulan cloaking device? I'll have to clear this with the Federation Council. In the meantime, assemble your fleet, Captain. (Shanthi and her aide leave)
