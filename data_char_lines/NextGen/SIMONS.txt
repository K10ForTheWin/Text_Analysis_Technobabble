Ambassador Alkar, the Rekag-Seronia dispute has threatened Federation ships for many months. We are grateful that you are willing to undertake this mission and you have our full support. However, we also recognise that safety is an issue. Not just yours, but the crew that escorts you. To send you on an unarmed transport puts everyone at risk. I think it best if you proceed to Rekag-Seronia aboard the Enterprise. Once you get to Rekag-Seronia, you can conduct your negotiations as you see fit. Until then, you'll be in good hands with Captain Picard. Good luck, and a successful journey. (transmission ends)
