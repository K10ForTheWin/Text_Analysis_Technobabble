Pleased to. Hello. Oh, yes, that is it. Pleased to meet you, Deanna. It is beautiful. Comfortable, also. There is another word that describes it. But I cannot remember. Your mother told me of your need. A moment. Husband. You need a husband. I need a wife. [Corridor] I must to apologise for yesterday. My words, they were confused. Not in everything. She has an image of you in her mind. She shared it with me. You are even more beautiful. The way my people communicate, it is direct. Nothing is hidden. Your mother is the first to learn our telepathy. No. To communicate with her is very different. Always there is a part of her that. Um. A part of her that is dark. A part of her that can not be seen. Do you understand? She called it. A moment. Privacy. This is privacy? It is normal? If this is your way, I am relieved. I will leave now. I am glad to have stopped also. [Ten Forward] Please, what is a poem? Yes, I see. Thank you. Heaven. I am very apologetic for what has happened to your mother. No. I tried to explain before. Bad thoughts, they hurt her. Inside her, the dark place. She is, what are the words? I don't have the words. (So he sends Troi the pictures instead, and Troi puts her hands over her ears) Do you understand now? Helping. Trying to help Lwaxana. I was. She was. You, Deanna. Maybe you. You must. How can I explain I did not understand. Your mother. Part of her is very frightened. She may resist you. No.
