(more spiky, Harper-esque) I warned you not to push the engines so hard. Two of the power shunts are on the verge of collapse. We'll be lucky if we can maintain warp six. I can try to realign the warp core. It'll take at least eleven hours, but I'll have to shut the engines down completely. Vekor is right. We should get rid of him. It's dangerous to have someone from Starfleet on board. I'm bypassing the aft plasma couplings. The power loss should only last for a few seconds. It has nothing to do with my repairs. I think there's a malfunction in the engine's intermix chamber. It could be one of any thirty subsystems. It'll take time to locate. We have to jettison the core. Flow regulator is not responding to manual override. Containment fields won't hold much longer. What are you saying? I don't take orders from you.
The antimatter containment units are starting to buckle! I'm taking the engines offline. It will take at least five hours to replace the antimatter containment unit. I agree. But I don't think that's you. I don't trust you, Galen. I don't think the rest of the crew does either. They're not going to follow you. No, but they will follow Tallera and so will I. (Narik leaves and Tallera enters) Shut your mouth, Klingon. How far? Are you sure, Galen? Riker turned on us. He tried to kill Galen before we beamed back. After that, you can go anywhere you want. Is it all there? I did not come this far to be cheated. I want it all, now.
