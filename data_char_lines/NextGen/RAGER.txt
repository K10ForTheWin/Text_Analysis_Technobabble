Aye, sir. Aye, sir. Impulse engines at full power. Aye, sir. Aye, sir. Aye, sir. Aye, sir. Aye, sir.
Aye, sir. I can't seem to remember how to enter the coordinates, sir.
(a dark lady) Aye, sir. (the ship shakes) Aye, sir. (after a short while) We've lost main power. Auxiliary power down to twenty percent. (the viewscreen shows four beams pulling the Enterprise towards the opening spacedoors) Auxiliary power failing. The tractor beams have released us, sir. Sir! The inertial motion from the tractor beams is still carrying us forward. Impulse engines are offline and I can't stop our momentum. We're falling directly into the star. [Jenolen] We're in orbit, Captain. Our altitude is one hundred fifty thousand kilometres.
Aye sir. Helm won't lock to those coordinates, sir. Is there something wrong, sir?
