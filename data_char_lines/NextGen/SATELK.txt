(a Vulcan) Did you see Mister Albert's ship break formation before it collided with your ship? You may be seated. Did any of you see the collision take place? Cadet Sito, you were in the tail position, therefore you should have seen any sign of trouble from Cadet Albert. Yet you saw nothing? Did your attention falter? Sensor readings? (a murmur goes around the room) Mister Crusher, will you describe a Yeager loop? Mister Crusher, did your team remain in formation throughout the loop? Computer, display Saturn NavCon file six dash three seven nine. These images were obtained by a navigational control satellite in orbit around Saturn during a standard sensor sweep. Computer, freeze image. Magnify sector gamma three and enhance. (the five little ships are forming a circle, not a diamond) This image was recorded when your ships moved briefly into the satellite's sensor range. According to the time index, what you see on the monitor took place seven seconds after Nova Squadron completed the Yeager loop.
