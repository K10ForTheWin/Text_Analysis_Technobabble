(female) You're killing us. [Observation lounge] Our planet is already being affected. We have measured large gravitational shifts throughout our system. That research was only preliminary. Our original analysis was incomplete. We were not willing to wait any longer. We knew that if we disabled enough ships, Starfleet would come. Then at least we would be able to present our case. Neither you nor the Ferengi suffered any casualties, Commander. The actual damage to your vessels was negligible. I know precisely how our pulse affected your field coils. With my help, your ship could be operational in ten hours. Provided you agree to review our research. Rabal, don't. The probes are the only leverage we have. If we There. Shields have been restored. You will be able to reengage your engines in approximately eight hours. I'm sorry you've been inconvenienced. But that's all it is, an inconvenience. Our concerns are much more important than the condition of your engines. That didn't happen, Commander. And saving lives is precisely what we're trying to do. There's no point in trying to talk to you. You've already decided not to listen. (Serova leaves) That's your response? More research? More delays. I suppose I shouldn't have expected anything different. Not we. You can do whatever you want, Rabal. I'll have no part of this. It's just another delay. [Bridge] They wanted proof. I'm going to give it to them. I'm sorry.
