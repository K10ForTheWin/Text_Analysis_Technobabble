Readings? He took a severe blow. Possible trauma to the telencephalon. I can't find his cardial organ. There it is. Up here. Ever seen anything like this? (Tava, a female doctor, palpates the chest) You think that's something? Look at this (holds up a foot) He has digits on his terminus. (Tava removes the mittens to reveal the patient has fingers, unlike his alien doctors) You want us to believe that all your abnormalities are inherited genetic traits? Genetic irregularities? That thing isn't even the same species as we are. It's all the space flights. They have attracted creatures from outer space. I think we ought to call Central Security. What if there're more of them? They could be everywhere. It doesn't make sense that he's the only one. Think about it. Stop him! Somebody stop him! He shot him. The alien shot Krola. (Tava gets on the emergency phone) I have a circulation pattern. It's very weak. We have to get him on vital buffers right now (Crusher, Worf and a medic beam in) With that thing.
