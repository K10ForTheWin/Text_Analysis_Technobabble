Captain Picard, what happened? We detected no malfunctions before the explosion. Everything seemed to be running as smoothly as the other flights. Were you able to save the pilot? I'm sorry. Compared to the Enterprise's, our sensors are rather primitive. I doubt they contain any information that your sensors overlooked. I understand. We'll transmit the information. Can we be of any further assistance? That may be difficult. The only source I know is in the Sigma Erani system. And I can't guarantee they'll have any. For obvious reasons, no one wants to keep it around. In fact, even I may stop selling it. It's just too dangerous.
