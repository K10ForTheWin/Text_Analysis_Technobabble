(not obviously a Native American) I read your report, Commander. My condolences to you and your crew. Captain Picard's death is a loss to the entire Federation. I see that you've asked to postpone your mission to the Argus sector. For what reason? The Dessican authorities have jurisdiction in this case, Commander. I suspect you're right. The question remains, are you the one to pursue this? All right, Commander. I'm officially placing the Enterprise on detached duty. Your mission is at your discretion. Good luck.
