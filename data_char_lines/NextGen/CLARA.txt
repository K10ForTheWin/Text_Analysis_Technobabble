I like to cook all kinds of stuff, like yogurt and raisin salad, chocolate chip pancakes and purple omelettes. You put grape juice in the eggs. Isabella doesn't like it very much. She says it tastes funny. Yes, please. Yes, but she takes two cubes. She's very, very pretty. She has blonde hair and a blue dress with white buttons. Her ears are pierced and she's tall. You don't think she's real. I have to go plant the nasturtiums now. I'm Keiko's helper in the arboretum today. Okay. Counsellor Troi? Isabella says she likes you. See, Isabella? You have to push your finger into the soil as far as it can go. I'm making a hole for the seeds. Now they need to be watered. But the baby seeds are very small, so we mustn't give them too much to drink. (the firefly passes through Clara's head, then a second voice joins in with Clara's humming) Hello? Is anybody there? Isabella? Isabella, how come I can see you? No. I've just never seen you before. Not for real. Yes, it's wonderful. We'd better finish planting the seeds first. Like what? We'd better finish planting first. I promised Keiko. I'd better ask my daddy. I'm Clara Sutter. That's my daddy. But Isabella wanted to see Engineering. But Daddy Why do you keep disappearing like that? Where did you go? That's the door to the cargo bay. We can't go in there. Okay. Isabella, why are you so serious lately? You haven't even smiled once today. (Isabella attempts a smile, and feels her face to find out what it's like) You're my best friend, Isabella. I don't know. Because we do things together and we trade secrets. If they're lucky. Before I had you, I didn't have one. Every time I made friends with someone, my daddy's job would change and we'd move to a new ship. It takes time to make a best friend. It depends. With you, not very long. You always listened to me, even when I was sad. Race you. Ready, set, go! (and they run around the corner straight into -) We were only playing. We're sorry. Thank you. Come on. (Clara takes Isabella's hand and they go back around the corner. Once Worf is gone, they return and run on ) [Engineering] No. I brought Isabella to see Ten Forward. Thank you. Just one, please. Isabella isn't thirsty. You're not like the other grown-ups. They don't think Isabella's real. Why? Like what? If the other grown-ups don't understand, how come you do? You did? What was she like? What was he like? It? Sounds scary. So is Isabella. (Troi enters) Hello. I guess so. Bye. I know that. I didn't want to go, but Isabella wanted to see it. I try to but she doesn't listen. [Turbolift] She's over there. She said. She said, you'd better leave us alone. [Corridor] That's okay. Here, you can help me put this together if you want. They're not mean. They're just more serious than we are. You do? We're not allowed to go there. We are. I told you. That's not true. Who is it? Hi. Can Isabella come too? Well, okay. (Troi and Clara leave, Isabella appears and her eyes turn red) [Bridge] I've never made a cup before. How do you make the round part? You did? I think we need more water. Isabella? I didn't do it. It was Isabella. She's invisible. I didn't do it. I didn't. Isabella, stop! (Clara runs out) [Arboretum] (and into the arboretum for a good cry) Why were you being so mean to me? Why'd you do that to my friend? You're scaring me. She said they were going to come and kill everyone. The others, like her. But she's not imaginary anymore. She's real now. I can see her. Yes. I think so. Maybe. What about in the closet? It's about Isabella. I think her feelings were hurt. She said she liked me, she liked being with me. She was my friend. She only got mean when I stopped paying attention to her. But Daddy. Yes, Captain. Isabella? Isabella? Don't you want to talk to me? I'm not mad at you. Isabella? I'm scared, Isabella. (Isabella appears) Please don't hurt us. If you still want to be my best friend, I'd like that very much. (Isabella turns into a firefly and sails away, taking all the other fireflies with her) [Bridge] That's okay. For a while you were. I'm sorry I have to go away. I hope so.
