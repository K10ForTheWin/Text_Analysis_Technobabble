Aye, sir. (She activates the controls and things fizzle) What the hell? Engineering, I need more power to the primary energising coil. Brossmer to Commander Riker. I'm losing them I have to abort. [Romulan Engineering] I can't locate their patterns. [Romulan Engineering] I didn't have any warning that something would go wrong, sir. Suddenly their patterns just weren't there. But that happened before we even arrived. If the particles were produced on the Romulan ship, why are you detecting them here? Commander, are these chronitons dangerous? Aye, sir. The following areas are showing contamination. Sickbay, Transporter room three, main Bridge, Captain's Ready room, shuttlebay two, and main Engineering. Not with the internal sensors, Commander. Captain. I'm still running the decontamination programme. Mister Data believes we shouldn't engage the warp drive until I've cleared all the chroniton fields from the ship. Yes, sir. Should I wait until after the service is over before beginning decontamination?
