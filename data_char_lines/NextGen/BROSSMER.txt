Aye, sir. (She activates the controls and things fizzle) What the hell? Engineering, I need more power to the primary energising coil. Brossmer to Commander Riker. I'm losing them I have to abort. [Romulan Engineering] They should be returning to your coordinates, sir. No, sir. I can't locate their patterns. [Romulan Engineering] We've lost them, sir. [Bridge] I've done all I can, sir. I'm afraid they're gone. I didn't have any warning that something would go wrong, sir. Suddenly their patterns just weren't there. But that happened before we even arrived. If the particles were produced on the Romulan ship, why are you detecting them here? Commander, are these chronitons dangerous? Aye, sir. The following areas are showing contamination. Sickbay, Transporter room three, main Bridge, Captain's Ready room, shuttlebay two, and main Engineering. Not with the internal sensors, Commander. Brossmer to Commander Data. I've just detected a large chroniton field on deck seventeen. The field strength is three hundred percent above the others we've found, sir. Captain. I'm still running the decontamination programme. Mister Data believes we shouldn't engage the warp drive until I've cleared all the chroniton fields from the ship. Yes, sir. Brossmer to Commander Data. I'm sorry to disturb you, sir. We've cleared the critical areas of chronitons but we've detected a new field forming in Ten Forward that's stronger than any we've seen before. [Bridge] Should I wait until after the service is over before beginning decontamination? Aye, sir. Commander Data, chroniton field strength in Ten Forward has just increased by three thousand percent. Yes, Commander. Yes, Commander? Aye, sir. (Geordi and Ro fall to the floor under the effects, but now everyone can see them. The party grinds to a halt)
