Welcome. I've been expecting you. [Picard's quarters] How did you find me? Platinum, was it? My wings. I kept them for their sentimental value. Oh, they're nearby. They're packing, as a matter of fact, since we can no longer remain here. What is it that you think you're rescuing me from? My shipmates and I have all taken wives. A few even have children. You can't rescue a man from a place that he calls his home. [Beata's quarters] (Beata has slipped into something more comfortable) Five months in a rescue pod no bigger than this room is an eternity I hope none of you will ever have to face. When we finally made it here, we thought we'd died and gone to heaven. You've seen the women of the planet. They're tall and strong and lovely. But after the newness wore off, we started to see how the men were treated. There's no votes. There's no opinions. There's no respect. Despite their problems, Lieutenant, we happen to like it here on Angel One. We're not going anywhere. Mistress Beata be damned! Her wish is not my command, and neither is yours. You can't force us to go. I can't answer that. They're gone. (Ariel comes out and embraces him) [Beata's quarters] We were no harm to anyone. Why did you tell them where to find us? That's very kind of you, but we're not going. We don't want to die. We don't want to leave, either. Thank you.
