You are my prisoner. Stay there. Name and rank. A Romulan ship will arrive shortly. You will accompany me on board. You're lying. Get up. Sit. You're afraid of dying. I'm not. To die in the service of my people. You can be sarcastic now, but in a few millennia, when humans are extinct and the Romulan Empire spans the galaxy. You may address me as Centurion Bochra. Nothing. Without it, you're blind? How did this happen? And your parents let you live? No wonder your race is weak. You waste time and resources on defective children. What are you saying? Sit down. Sit down! [Bridge] (Riker is hanging over Wesley's shoulder) I cannot surrender to the Federation. If the situation were reversed would you not die to avoid capture? I no more wish to die than you do. What is it? I've lost almost all feeling in my legs. How do we locate the beacon? Do all humans give up so easily? We have the sensor device you are carrying. Your eye device does. Connect them. You cannot do it? Why? Then I will be your eyes. [Bridge] Not so fast. Ready. Bearing three five zero. The storm may be breaking. At which point, I'll be your prisoner. I don't know. Straight ahead. To the right. [Ready room] We've found it! Will that be difficult? I have given them no information, Commander, but I have not been mistreated. In fact, this human saved my life.
