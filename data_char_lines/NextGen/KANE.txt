This is the food replicator, and your computer terminal. These are standard guest quarters, sir. I can try and find something bigger if you want. The holodecks, Ten Forward, and the gymnasium are all at your disposal. The computer can tell you how to find them. Until we issue you a combadge, just use one of these panels if you need anything. Excuse me, sir but I have to return to duty.
