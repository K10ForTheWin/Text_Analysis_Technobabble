Forgive my scepticism, Doctor, but your claims are somewhat extravagant. Protect a shuttle within a star's corona? Not even your own government believes it can be done. I agree. My own research into solar energy transfer suggests that Vaytan's corona is extremely unstable. I do not believe the shield will ever work. Its very concept is flawed. What reason would anyone have to kill him? I see. You are suggesting that I had such a motive. But since it wasn't successful, it is illogical to conclude that I had such a motive, isn't it.
