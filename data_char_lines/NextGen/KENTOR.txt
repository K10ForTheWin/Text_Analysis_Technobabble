Where's it from? The first visitor we've ever had. You want to speak to Gosheven. We'll take you to him. He's an android. But our colony survived and prospered. What if he's right and you're wrong? Shouldn't we consider that possibility? I'm not sure. Gosheven's done well for us, but I'd like to hear more of what you have to say. And once the Federation resettles us, we'll be left alone? Yes. The question is, how do we convince Gosheven? Because he's respected. Most people will do what he says. I don't know. Gosheven's got a lot of supporters. There are other places, other challenges.
