Are you saying we attacked your outpost? Evidence. So you are making an accusation. The Klingon Empire will not stand for these kinds of lies. Gowron won't bother with such a minor incident. Gowron will come here? I will investigate this further, Picard. You need not bother Gowron with this matter. Qapla'! [La Forge's quarters] Do not bore me with your human pleasantries. I told you we did not kill the woman. Now I will prove it to you. ghoS! (a Klingon escorts a woman into the room) This is Lieutenant Aquiel Uhnari. (soon after) We found her on our side of the border heading toward Sector two five two zero. She is lucky my patrol ship did not destroy her vessel on sight. You still try to blame us. At least I do not wear the uniform of the P'tak! He was doing his job. Very well. In the interests of diplomacy, I will allow you to speak to Morag. But my patience has limits. (Torak and his aide storm out) Answer their questions. This is a diplomatic matter, Morag! Do not make me search your ship. Take him.
