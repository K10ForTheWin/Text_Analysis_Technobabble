Father? Yes. I was waiting for the right moment, but that will never come. I'm leaving school. I want to concentrate on my music. That's what I care about. Through it all, there was my music. I think you know that, Father. This is the life I want. Thank you, father. (Batai goes back indoors) Father! It's Mother. Hurry. [Living room] (now with his father's hairline) Happy day, everybody. It's time to go see the launching. Come on, Kamie. Hurry up now. Let's go see the launching. (Batai puts a hat on his nephew and they leave)
