Don't worry about a thing, Captain. We've done this a hundred times, and we're ready when you are. Activate Sterile Field. Neural callipers. (the electronic anaesthesia is applied) This will be a secondary cardiac procedure with mid-line entry and excision of the early model unit. I anticipate no complications, as the patient has had positive primary results and exhibits extraordinary physical condition. We'll all be home in time for dinner. Tissue mitigator. [Observation lounge] There's been some capillary reaction here. Let's proceed carefully. We'll need sharper focus on the thoracic polychromatics and verification of myocardial enzyme balance. [Pakled ship] It's not working. Something's wrong. The metabolation occlusions aren't holding. Damn it! I can't stop the heterocyclic declination. Fuse. (laser beams fire down) Again! We need a biomolecular physiologist in here. This man is dying. Negative. Failing. And capillary integrity too unpredictable to attempt a resect. I'm not qualified.
