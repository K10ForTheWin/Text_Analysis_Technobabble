Gorta. I am Gorta. I crashed here. Mining? So that's what all this equipment is here for. Lursa? B'Etor? Do you know where they are? Maybe I do. My personal code of conduct prohibits sharing. But I'd consider a trade. You have a point. Could you perhaps fail to tell the Pakleds that we were mining their ore? The Duras sisters. They are magnificent, aren't they? Selling the ore, I imagine. They took everything. The ore, the ship. We were going to sell the ore to a Yridian trader. We were supposed to meet him in the Ufandi system. Like I said, they took everything. [Ten Forward]
