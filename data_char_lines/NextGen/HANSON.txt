The truth is, hell, we are not ready. We've known they were coming for over a year. We've thrown every resource we have into this, but still Commander Shelby took over Borg tactical analysis six months ago. I've learned to give her a wide latitude when I want to get things done. That's how I intend to operate here. We expected much more lead time. Your encounter with the Borg was over seven thousand light years away. Another time, Commander. Your captain and I have a lot to cover. But rumour has it Commander Shelby's played a hand or two. (Riker and Shelby leave) Keep your eye on her, Jean Luc. She's one very impressive young lady. Just an old man's fantasies. When Shelby came into Tactical, every admiral's uncle had a take on this Borg business. She cut through it. She put us on track. Please. She'd make you a hell of a first officer. Don't tell me he's going to pass up another commission? The Melbourne. It's his if he wants it. Hasn't he told you? You may want to tell him that. We're still waiting on his decision. This is the third time we've pulled out the captain's chair for Riker. He just won't sit down. Let me tell you something, Jean-Luc. There are a lot of young hotshots like Shelby on their way up. Riker could suddenly look like he's standing still next to them. He's hurting his career by staying put. If I were you, I'd kick him in the rear end for his own good. [Shelby's quarters]
The fight does not go well, Enterprise. We're attempting to withdraw and regroup. Rendezvous with fleet (transmission lost) Captain's Log, stardate 44002.3. Repairs are complete, and the Enterprise is warping to rendezvous with Starfleet at Wolf three five nine. Communications from the site of battle have been cut off, possibly by Borg interference.
