What do you want? No. You are cha'Dich. I know. I cannot help. I am dead. A long time dead. No. My life ended on Khitomer. I served a proud family, a strong house. All that is gone. I cannot help. No. Mogh was loyal to the Emperor. Mogh suspected someone of plotting with the Romulans and followed them to Khitomer. I do not know. You must leave now, cha'DIch. I am dead. [Street] (Picard is jumped by two Klingons. He manages to draw the dagger and stabs one of them. Kahlest gets the other one in the back) You are brave, cha'DIch. Worf chose well. K'mpec would remember Kahlest. I caught his eye back then, but he was too fat. I will come. [Great Hall] Mogh was innocent. You are still fat, K'mpec. (Kahlest leaves)
