If I ever find the varmint who drew this, he'll be sorry he ever put pen to paper. I'm ten times uglier than that, ain't I? (the Mexican laughs) Shut up. You laugh so much, it's a wonder you ain't got flies in your mouth. Is that so. (Worf punches him in the face) If I ever find the varmint who drew this, he'll be sorry he ever put pen to paper. I'm ten times uglier than that, ain't I? (the Mexican laughs) Shut up. You laugh so much, it's a wonder you ain't got flies in your mouth. Well, looks like Sheriff Worf's here to arrest me. That don't sound like a bright idea. (Eli has gone to the bar, the Mexican is over on Worf's left) Do it? If you mean murder, then I guess I'm guilty. I've killed twenty three men, Sheriff. One more ain't going to make much of a difference. Of course, shooting someone as ugly as you couldn't be considered a crime, could it? Was you just born that way, or did your momma marry an armadillo? (a man behind Worf picks up a chair) Don't twitch a whisker, Sheriff, unless you want a shave. (his gun is drawn) Okay, boys. Saddle up. But first, get their money and jewellry. A man's got to make a living. (Eli's hat it blown off by a gunshot from the doorway) You'll regret this, stranger. (Eli twirls his pistol back and forth before holstering it.) [Engineering] Frankly, I don't think I'll be around here that long. Not after my old man hears about this. My pa. When he breaks me out of this tin can, the gravedigger'll be working overtime. You sure got a way with women, Sheriff. [Picard's quarters]
