T'Jon. Have you got it? You've got to get it to us. T'Jon, please. We're dying down here. You don't know. It's worse than it's ever been before. Stop! I can't listen any more! T'Jon, there are so many people here. So much suffering. We need the medicine. You've got to get it to us. I can't go on. Help, T'Jon. Please.
