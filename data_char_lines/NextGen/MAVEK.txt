Good afternoon. I've got some good news for you. Doctor Syrus suggested that you might enjoy a couple of hours in the common area today. Well? I hope you're hungry. They're serving spiny lobe-fish today. That's what you said the last time. [Asylum Corridor] (they walk slowly down the corridor. there is distant screaming, and the Enterprise alien walks past too) [Asylum common area] (the inmates are doing things that the mentally disturbed are assumed to do - clay modelling, painting etc.) I'll be back with your lunch. (a female inmate sits opposite Riker) Talking to your Starship again, Jaya? You know you're not supposed to take utensils from the common area. (Jaya gives him the spoon) You're welcome to try. Of course you are. That's right. Not bad for a crazy man. I remember when they brought you in. You were struggling, screaming. We could barely hold you down. In fact, just getting the blood off your hands took over an hour. On your hands, clothes. You didn't just kill that man, you mutilated him. I'm afraid you did. You stabbed him. They found you near the body, the knife in your hand. Yes it is. And if you get out of here, you're going to stand trial. I imagine the punishment will be quite severe, considering you stabbed him nine times. Who are you? Take them to Security Ward. (Data deals with the guard, and Worf takes out the attendant. Data grabs Riker and drags him to -) [Asylum common area] He broke out of his cell last night. We found him running down a corridor claiming people had come to take him back to his starship.
