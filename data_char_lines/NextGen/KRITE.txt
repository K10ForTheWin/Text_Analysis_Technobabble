I don't understand it. A shuttle doesn't simply vanish. Good evening, Commander. Commander, thank you. Captain, would you all join us this evening? We would like to express our gratitude. Noor will be eager to get a first hand report. We should return to the surface. I know. I don't think so, Commander. We know about the two of you. We know what you're doing. We're going to make sure it doesn't happen again. In custody, and there's nothing you can do about it.
