Mister Orton? Is something wrong? I'm sure it's nothing serious. Perhaps the heating element under the table is malfunctioning. Orton, now! (Orton knocks Geordi over. The waiter gets a rifle from under the table and fires it at Geordi, hitting him square in the chest. Orton gets a gun for himself.)
May I help you, sir? There you go, sir. Didn't you order Scotch?
There you go.
Here's your ale, Mister O'Brien.
Right away. (Picard and Riker go to the bar)
