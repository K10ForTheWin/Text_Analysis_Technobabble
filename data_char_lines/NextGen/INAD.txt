(a silver-haired woman) Many months. We've been working for years, and we've surveyed only eleven planets in eight star systems. Tarmin, we mustn't influence people. We must let them come to us willingly. It takes years of study. Tarmin is the most proficient of our group. Exactly how long will it be before we reach Kaldra, Captain? Why do you suspect us, Captain? Captain, it is not our wish to obstruct you. What would you like? Jev is making a reasonable request, Captain. If we're to be accused, surely we're entitled to a defence? Tarmin did a memory probe on another of your crew. Has she suffered any ill effects? And neither will Counsellor Troi. Please, you may have as many people here as you need to guarantee her safety, but give us this chance to vindicate ourselves. Who is it? Who's doing this to you?
