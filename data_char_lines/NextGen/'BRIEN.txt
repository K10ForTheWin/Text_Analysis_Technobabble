Go ahead, Commander, what can I do for you?
I'm having trouble locking on, sir. Aye, sir, we got him.
Transporter beam locked, Captain.
On your command.
Captain Picard. [Shuttlebay two]
Stand by. Apparently not. [Transporter room]
Yes, Captain. O'Brien to Captain Picard. Captain, he's up to something.
Aye, sir. Energising. (But Danar tries to break out of the transporter beam)
Give us a minute, Captain. [Transporter room] Yes sir. [Transporter room]
Standing by, Captain. Aye, sir. Energising. (Geordi and Bochra appear in front of the viewscreen)
(unintelligible) We show as approximately Negative, Captain. Bridge. [Transporter room] Hold position, away team. [Transporter room]
You're at the centre of town. (The centre of town is at the edge of a massive crater) Captain's log, Stardate 43992.6. Admiral Hanson and Lieutenant Commander Shelby of Starfleet Tactical have arrived to review the disappearance of New Providence colony. No sign remains of the nine hundred inhabitants. [Ready room] Negative, sir. There's some kind of interference. I can't lock in on his signal.
Stand by, sir. (We join Reg in the transporter experience, including a maggot thing that bites his arm) [Transporter room]
Captain Picard to the Bridge, please.
Aye, sir.
Stand by, Commander. Engaging transport. [Transporter room] Not yet, Captain. I'm having trouble clearing the signal [Transporter room] Nothing that would cause an explosion like that I don't know, sir. Yes, sir. Stand by, Commander. Engaging transport. Stand by, Commander. Engaging transport. (And the holo-Riker draws and fires a phaser at the Krieger Wave converter) Stand by, Commander. Engaging transport. (The top of the converter lights up. A beam goes out to Riker and bounces back to the middle of the machine. There's one small explosion, then a bigger one. The programme is terminated and we are in a bare) [Holodeck] (Except, fortunately, for the table and chairs)
Ready, sir. [Shuttlecraft] I'm trying, sir. [Transporter room] I may have lost one of them. [Transporter room] (Four children dressed the same as the shuttle occupants appear. The tall skinny youth in Starfleet uniform, with a healthy crop of hair, speaks)
This is Chief O'Brien, sir. Almost ready. It has to be right the first time. Entering corrections now, sir. [Transporter room] Stand by to transport.
I've got them, Captain.
Some kind of force field went up.
There's nothing to lock onto, Commander.
O'Brien here. Aye, sir. Transporter emergency! I'm losing her signal! I'm losing the pattern. Trying to re establish. I'm sorry, sir. I wasn't able to retrieve the signal. The Ambassador's dead. Second officer's personal log, supplemental. The risks aboard a starship are accepted by all who serve, but I have never failed to observe a deep emotional response to the loss of a comrade. It is at times like this that I greatly miss the ability to share human feelings. [Transporter room]
Commander Riker. The away team, plus four, is on board.
O'Brien to Bridge. [Transporter room]
Acknowledged, Captain. Aye, sir.
Aye, sir. (Three Ferengi arrive. One is holding a purple bag)
O'Brien to La Forge.
