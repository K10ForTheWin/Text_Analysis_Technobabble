(the female alien) We are looking for the lodging chamber of Captain Jean-Luc Picard. When is he expected to arrive? He will come. First officer's log, Stardate 43745.2. We have departed Gemaris Five, where for the past two weeks Captain Picard has been serving as mediator in a trade dispute between the Gemarians and their nearest neighbour, the Dachlyds. [Bridge] We are Vorgons. I am Ajur. This is Boratus. Have you heard of the Tox Uthat? Essentially that story is correct. We came upon a brief account stating you had discovered an object of unknown origin while vacationing on Risa. From its description, a crystal cube that fits in the palm of the hand, we surmised it could very well be the Tox Uthat. You will give it to us immediately so that we may return with it. We are to be witness to a great moment, Picard. Do not interrupt the captain. It is most puzzling. (The aliens beam away) Congratulations Picard. We knew you would not fail us. You yourself said, the Uthat belongs to the future. You have fulfilled your destiny all too well, Picard. [Picard's room]
