I understand you have a problem. Bok is no DaiMon. He was relieved of command six years ago. He was unstable, dangerous. We had to confine him to Rog Prison. He was able to buy himself out about two years ago. I understand he was seen in the Dorias cluster not too long ago. You don't have to thank me, Captain. (transmission ends)
