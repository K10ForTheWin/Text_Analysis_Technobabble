Masaka is waking. (after the break, Data is sitting on the warp core as Picard enters. There is a symbol on his chest.) Captain. I've been waiting for you. You should feel honoured. I don't usually wait for anyone. Masaka is waking. I am not Masaka. I am Ihat. Commander Data? You mean the one who was here? He's gone. Who can say where? Picard to Counsellor Troi. Report to main Engineering immediately. I come from Masaka's city. There are no others like me. You will find out. Do you understand pain? Death? That is all you need to know of Masaka. It is what she is. Go. Leave this place before she finds you. It can be done. I did it. (Troi enters) Masaka. (Data kneels before her in fear, and when he looks up again, there is a different symbol on his chest) Captain. That was a cruel joke you played on me. For a moment, a brief moment, I actually thought that woman was Masaka. Pitiful, isn't it. You won't catch me humiliating myself for a woman even if she were a queen. She's a lazy creature. She spends most of her time sleeping. The problem is, what she does when she's awake. Try to stop the sun from climbing the sky? Only Korgano can do that, and he's not here. Now you've done it, Captain. Masaka is awake. [Ten Forward] (it now contains tropical foliage and stone, and a large version of Troi's ornament with a sun image on it. Think lost Mayan ruins.) Well, aren't we the persistent one. Is anyone else so charming? I told you she would. Who told you that? Oh, yes, yes. Legend has it she chopped him up and used his bones to make the world. Any wonder he doesn't like to talk about her? I don't know. He's not chasing her anymore. Stop asking me these questions. I was fast enough to get away from her once. I don't want her to find me again. I'll wind up on her sacrificial slab. Well, there's an idea. Better you than me. You must build Masaka's temple. The Queen's temple. That will get her attention. You need the sign. I could give it to you. So could the old man. But just try getting it out of him. If she finds out, you can't imagine her rage. She lets people die of thirst. A terrible death. Sometimes she burns them alive. She is glorious. If she comes, you will take my place? All right. Quickly, give me your hand. A line, as the unending horizon. A curve as. She has found me. It seems I was not fast enough.
