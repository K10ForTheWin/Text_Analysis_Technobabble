(a young man) Do you know how long we have searched for a home? Almost two hundred years. Then we found this world. Can you blame us for not wanting to give it up? Anthwara, he's laughing at you. He thinks you're talking about old superstition and nonsense. And if we do not? No, we won't. Leave now. [Observation lounge] You shouldn't be here, Wesley. Bring them over here. This is not their world. They have no right to be here. We don't recognise that treaty. You have no authority here. (the fight starts with a Cardassian and Indian struggling for a weapon, which keeps firing into the air. Then others join in. Wesley runs forward)
