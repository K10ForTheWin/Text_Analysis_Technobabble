Greetings. You are empathic. Then although you already know my feelings toward you, allow me to put them into words. I am looking forward to this journey, now more than ever, because it gives me the chance to be in your company. Artists, they tend to ramble, neglect the moment. I am passion, the libido. I am the anarchy of lust, the romantic and the lover. I am also the warrior, the perfect line which never wavers. It takes a fine mind to realise that, Counsellor Troi. Only when the spirit moves me. Perhaps, if it is not inconvenient, Counsellor Troi could escort me. With your permission. Much of what we do is similar. We have both learned how to allow people to examine feelings hidden deep within their psyche. In fact, with you here now is provoking an emotional revelation. Well, not that deep. Can't you tell? Well I feel that soon, perhaps after the briefing by your Captain, that you will be hungry, and that perhaps we could dine together and compare experiences. As will I. Well, until we find our own method of communication. As do I. [Observation lounge] (Picard enters) I believe I have to get ready for a dinner appointment. The sound of this ship is quite remarkable. Can't you feel it? It moves through my body like a great pulse. It's easy to let that happen. Sometimes we must allow the surroundings to flow over us, to dwell on each separate part, how it feels, to allow it to fill you. (The Adonis leaves) Brothers. Your bravery as fighters is known. Now you must demonstrate courage in a new way. Cease hostilities. Allow us to meet. That's not necessary. I prefer to arrive with the smallest possible complement. We do not want to add to an already tense situation. Thank you, Captain. (At an aft station, looking at a map)
