An analysis of the life span of the swarming moths of Gonal Four. They only live for twenty hours, then they all die. They're all dead. We're going to die, too. We're going to die. (the turbolift jolts) It's Jay Gordon. I accept. (another pin) Yes, I think so. Yes, I see them. Yes. But one of them looks broken. It's half out of the groove. If the captain stays here, we won't make it. We'll all die. Then we'll never get out. What's wrong?
