Enterprise, I am Orn Lote, engineer. We are having difficulties with the reactor that powers the barystatic filters on our southern continent. We may have to shut it down for repairs. I hope so. If we are forced to disable the reactor, it would take months to re-establish the ionic currents the filters have formed in the atmosphere. Thank you, Captain. (transmission ends) Quite ingenious. Quite ingenious, indeed. (coughs) I'm amazed at the way it can be incorporated with the existing system. I'm eager to see the field modulator in place, Commander. (Lote coughs and uses his inhaler) Yes. [Ready room] Commander. Over here, quickly. Commander! Look at this.
