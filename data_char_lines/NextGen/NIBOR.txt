(sets up new game) Pawn to queen four, King's level. Check. Of course, now that you're losing. You can't resign now. Ah, then you'll finish the game if I let you out of the cell? Clever, human, but I'm not that foolish. I do not trust you. Come out here. (puts the forcefield back up) Now save your rook, if you can. [Tog's quarters]
