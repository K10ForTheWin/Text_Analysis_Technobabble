No one knows. It is not written in the sacred texts. Gowron is the Leader of the Council. He commands the entire Defence Force. If he chooses to oppose you We do not have to prove anything to Gowron. Gowron has brought the Knife of Kirom? No one is permitted to remove it from the sacred vault. That he cheated. Do not think about what happened. You must think of the future, of the Empire. We found a way to imprint specific information in your neurosynaptic patterns. We gave you memories, and not just any memories. We gave you the experiences of Kahless as written in the sacred texts.
