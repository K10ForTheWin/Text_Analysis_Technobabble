Number One? Is that why we keep shaking? What about you? We have to climb up the shaft. The crew has decided to stick together. We all go or we all stay. Yes, it did. Okay. Quiet, both of you. That's an order. Ready, sir. (everything shakes) He's scared. The Laughing Vulcan and His Dog? In appreciation for the way you helped us get out of the turboshaft, and the way you helped us not be scared, we want to present to you this commemorative plaque. Give it to him. (Jay Gordon hands it over. It reads - to Captain Picard, in appreciation for the way you helped us get out of the turboshaft and the way you helped us not be scared. Jay Gordon Graas, Paterson Supra, Marissa Flores)
