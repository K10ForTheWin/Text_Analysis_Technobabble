We were at the arcade, sir. I brought this balloon with me, filled with red pillion dye. You see, Willie is always making fun of me. I figured I'd get him back. We programmed the game for an ordinary laser duel. You know, twenty one points. Four points for a We went out to the forest behind the east arcade. I told Willie that his laser pistol looked kind of funny, almost like a real one. When I went behind the trees, I put the balloon into my vest, and then Yes, sir. Yes, sir. It was just a joke, sir. I didn't think this was going to happen. I am, I am now, sir. That we'd stay out of trouble, sir. He really could die. Can isolate what, sir? (Data goes to the turbolift controls) Their laboratory can isolate what, Commander? Sir, sir, I know I made a mistake, and I can tell you're angry, but if you're not going to talk to me (Data gets off at the Bridge instead of Sickbay) [Bridge] There, you see? How can I tell him if he's not going to listen to me? It's just a waste of time. He won't listen. (Jake rushes off down the corridor again) [Bridge] (The Enterprise has established orbit around a green world)
I'm fine. Really. It's not your fault. I don't know. Only thirty two points. I know. Hey, Wes. Do well for both of us, okay? Captain, I'm going to Beltane Nine [Shuttlecraft] To sign onto a freighter. Tell my father I'm sorry. [Bridge] No. [Shuttlecraft] I can't face him. I'm leaving. (alarm sounds) [Bridge] I've lost power! [Bridge] I can't get the engine started. What am I going to do? I'm going to crash. Please, help me! It's no use, Captain. I'm going to die out here. [Bridge] Aim it at Relva? I can't do that. It's crazy. [Bridge] But I'll burn up! Okay. It's done. Point zero two zero speed. Captain, I sure hope you're right. Point zero zero three. [Bridge] Zero zero nine. Zero one two. Zero one five. [Bridge] Zero one nine. Yes, sir. Yes, sir! Yes, sir. Yes, sir, Look, I'm sorry I damaged the shuttle, Captain. But Mister Riker says I can work on fixing it as part of my discipline training. Yes, sir. And I am sorry I messed up. No, sir. And thank you. Thank you for saving my life. Yes, sir.
