Sensors detect no vessels. We can enter orbit while they're on the far side of the planet. And if we delay dropping out of warp until the last possible instant, we could gain a few more seconds. I'll have to be sure my calculations are accurate, Ensign. We'll be within transporter range in nineteen seconds. Helm, new course, heading zero five two mark seven. Stand by to drop out of warp in eight seconds. Emergency deceleration in five seconds. The Borg will be in weapons range in thirty two seconds. We still can't locate Captain Picard's team and there's no sign of Commander Riker or Lieutenant Worf. The Borg ship is powering up its weapons array. The port nacelle's been hit. We've lost warp engines. Direct hit. No damage to the Borg ship. Still down. We can't outrun them. I know about that research. Commander La Forge was developing a programme that would implement metaphasic properties. It's in the databanks but it's never been tested. I can, but we have no way of knowing if the shields will hold. Aye, sir. Programme is online. Engaging metaphasic shield now. The Borg ship has broken off pursuit. Sir, metaphasic shielding is losing integrity. No. We won't be able to stay in here longer than another three or four minutes. Last estimate was another half hour. What? Excuse me, sir, but this isn't the Academy. And a student thesis is a long way from a workable plan. If her calculations are off, that eruption could encompass us. Subsurface fusion has been initiated. An eruption is forming on the surface. (whoosh, kaBOOM) She did it! The Borg ship has been destroyed, sir.
