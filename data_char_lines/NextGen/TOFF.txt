I've added a Veltan sex idol to my collection. What? With the pearls intact? What is that? Something new? And you didn't tell me. It's a mannequin of some sort. It doesn't seem particularly sentient right now. Well, someone has certainly played a game on you, Fajo. He falls well. Do not be upset, my friend. I'm having a delightful visit. Come along, Varria. You're much more fun to play with than Fajo's new toy.
