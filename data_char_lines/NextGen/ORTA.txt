Captain Picard, I am Orta. Please forgive my appearance. Unfortunately, some years ago, as a guest of the Cardassians, my face was mutilated. My vocal cords were cut. I am sorry, but after speaking with Ro Laren, I decided that it was. I am not at all interested in peace. And I am not convinced you are, either. All is not what it seems to be, Captain. Perhaps someone is using you to get to me. Perhaps you are a victim of this deception as well. I do not know. Your mission was to seek out the Bajoran terrorists who destroyed the Federation settlement on Solarion Four. As I have informed Ro Laren, it was not the Bajora. [Bridge]
