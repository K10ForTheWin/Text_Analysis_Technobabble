You are so brave, facing down that evil man like you did. Annie, you big galoot. You best not forget that tonight, 'cos I'm going to make you beef steak and some gooseberry cobbler for dessert.

What'll you have? This ain't Kansas City. We ain't got none of that fancy European stuff here. Maybe I should get you a sherry. Ain't that is what they serve at Miss Langford's? It is, ain't it? Ain't it? (Frank, the Mexican and an outlaw enter. The piano playing stops) You would not believe what I went through to get old man Newsom to give up his telegraph machine. (Worf looks the morse code transmitter over) Lord knows why I keep risking my life for you, Sheriff. (Troi signals Worf to respond)
