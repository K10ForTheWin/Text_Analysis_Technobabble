D'Tan, you should not bring that out here. You've been told many times. Off with you. We'll see you later tonight. Perhaps this is not such a good place to talk. [Romulan street] So, what do you think of your enemy, Captain Picard? Many of my colleagues fear what they have to say. But I have learned to listen carefully. Children like D'Tan are our future. Old men like me will not be able to hold on to ancient prejudice and hostility. Young people won't allow it. But now, now that they've met their first real Vulcan, it has only inspired them more. I am sure that is evident to you, Spock. Romulans are passionate people. The Vulcans will learn to appreciate that quality in us. We will know soon. The Proconsul has agreed to meet with you. First Officer's log, stardate 45245.8. The Enterprise remains at Qualor Two as we continue to investigate the theft of a surplus Vulcan ship. The trail has led us to the former wife of a deceased smuggler. [Piano bar] (Riker takes a drink from the tray of a Zakdorn waiter, and goes over to a large, four-armed lady piano player) Proconsul? Ambassador Spock of Vulcan. Permit me to withdraw. We're looking forward to it. (Pardek leaves) But if Neral is ready to publicly endorse reunification. That may be true. What does it mean? Why would they need a Vulcan ship? How could they know of this location? Someone has betrayed us. Spock, we've been friends for eighty years. Jolan tru, Spock.
I got here as quickly as I could, Proconsul. I know nothing of him. To my knowledge, I have never seen him. Here on Romulus? I'll see to it. [Romulan street] (to lady) I'll take care of that. Come. (Picard and Data follow Pardek, and are stopped by two armed soldiers) Welcome to Romulus, Captain Picard. Don't let our soldiers frighten you. We had to get you off the street as quickly as we could. Romulan Security knows that you're here. I am Pardek. You are among friends, Captain.
