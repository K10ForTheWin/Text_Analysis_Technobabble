I'm sorry about this, Dix. Easy, Dan! Don't take him too seriously, Dix. His old lady's been giving him a hard time. You know how it is. I'll see what I can do. [Police station] (Crusher is continuing to try and imitate the other women, this time by powdering her nose. The Desk Sergeant is enjoying the view) Okay, Dix, we're cutting you loose. We know you're dealing with Redblock, Dixon. Take it from a friend, it doesn't help your case. Forget it. Hey, Dix, when are you coming over for supper? The kids'd love to see you, and you know how much you love Sharon's cooking. Blonde or brunette? Sounds like a working girl to me. I'll stop by the office with a bottle of scotch. You can tell me all about her. [Police station] (McNary sees the look on Picard's face when he sees Crusher, and leaves without another word) Dix, you in there? (The Thug greets the policeman and takes the bottle of drink away from him, then his gun) I saw your light, figured you were working late. Guess I was right. Nice company you're keeping, Dix. You forget to take the trash out this morning? (That earns him a punch in the solar plexus) He's right, Dix. That's pretty weak stuff. I wouldn't even buy that line of guff. Give it up, fellas. These guys are too smart to fall for that story. Don't make any deals with that slime, Dix! (The Thug knocks him down again) You're insane. You think you can kill a cop and get away with it? Someone has to book this creep. Once a cop always a cop, I guess. So this is the big goodbye. Tell me something, Dixon. When you've gone. will this world still exist? Will my wife and kids still be waiting for me at home?
