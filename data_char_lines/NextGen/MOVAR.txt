Excellent. Everything is proceeding as scheduled. Picard has rejected Gowron's plea for help. The Enterprise has left orbit.
Picard has rejected Gowron's plea for help. The Enterprise has left orbit. How many? Yes, Commander. There's an increase in tachyon emissions from the Federation fleet. If we try to cross it, they'll see us, even if we're cloaked. We've just received an urgent message from Lursa and B'Etor. Gowron's forces have attacked in three sectors. The Duras are nearing defeat. We think so. Just before we cross the border, we'll send out a massive tachyon pulse. A burst that large should cause enough interference to disable a part of their network. One of their ships is moving off the blockade line. Picard is redeploying the fleet to compensate for the missing ship. There's a gap opening in the net. If we act quickly we can move through. Commander? But it's what we've been waiting for. They have discovered us! Commander, the Duras need this convoy. Without these supplies, they cannot win. But what should I tell Lursa and B'Etor?
