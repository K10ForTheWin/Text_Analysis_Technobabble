(very hairy) So, tell me, why is it so important that you find this man? If we had business dealings, I can tell you that I wouldn't disappear. I'll be closing in a few hours. Perhaps we can discuss this more privately. Human, about two metres tall, smooth-headed. No. I don't remember anyone like that. And you're a Betazoid. I thought so. Listen, people who come in here, they count on a certain amount of anonymity. And if I were to start answering questions about them, even to a very beautiful woman, well, I wouldn't be in business very long. And being a businesswoman, I'm sure you understand. (and he goes off to serve another customer while at the other end of the bar) I think you've had a little too much to drink. You'd better leave. On your way, Yranac. (the bartender gets a phaser jabbed into his cheekbone) You say one word and you're a dead man.
Your ale, Ensign. [Bridge]
