Go away. I do not hear you. Korgano. I thought I had escaped you. You are a fine hunter but I am a powerful prey. You will never catch me. I thought I was alone. I thought I would not have to share the sky with you. You know me well, Korgano. I am getting sleepy. You always do that to me. Let the hunt begin again. I am eager for that. (Data falls asleep)
