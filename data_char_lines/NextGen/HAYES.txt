The Ferengi are claiming two of their freighters were destroyed by a Cardassian warship in your sector. Although I'm loathe to believe the Ferengi about anything, there was evidence of Cardassian weapons. If the Cardassians also attacked the Yosemite, it could indicate a large scale movement into this sector. How soon until you know? Very well. (transmission ends)
This is Ensign Hayes, sir. Commander La Forge has been taken to Sickbay with plasma burns. There's serious damage to the secondary plasma conduit but I think we've got it under control.
