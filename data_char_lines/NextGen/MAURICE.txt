Jean-Luc, I told you not to go running off to that Academy. I told you that Starfleet would bring you to a bad end, but you wouldn't listen. Now look at you. Dead before your time. Why couldn't you have listened? Didn't you know that I was working for your best interests? After all these years, even now, you manage to disappoint me, Jean-Luc.
