Hello, Chief. Having coffee? I'm surprised to see you here at this hour. You're not out of the honeymoon yet. Usually newlyweds can't keep their hands off each other. Any strange things going on down there? I've been hearing things. Kenicki in Engineering told me he saw a man in an old Starfleet uniform riding the lift near the engine core. When the lift got to the top, there was no one on it. There's more, there's lots more. There are strange things happening on this ship, O'Brien. Well, I think it's some kind of experiment. You see, Captain Picard is trying to see how long we'll take it, stuck here like rats. It's like we're laboratory animals. I don't want to sit and wait for death to sneak up behind me. You heard about them on the Brittain. Shut in their rooms, dying alone. That's not for me. I'd rather go out fighting. [Engineering] Hear that? Get us jammed into shelter areas. We sit and wait to die. Nobody'll ever find us. Do we want to die here like helpless children? We don't even know what we're dying for. What's wrong with standing up for ourselves? (Security arrive) Picard owes us some answers. (Gillespie thumps O'Brien, the security men join in and there's a brawl. Guinan gets a Big Gun from behind the bar and fires at the ceiling) What is that?
