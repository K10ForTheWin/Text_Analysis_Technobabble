Our arrival seems to have startled you. You couldn't transport us. The only way through our shield is our way, Captain. Our cloaking device may be off, but our shield is operating. We've brought you small tokens of welcome. (She hands over a bouquet) They've tried, Doctor Crusher. And failed. You have been brought to Aldea as our guests. We'll provide anything you need or want. There you are! I have you now! (She and Alexandra are laughing and happy) [First Unit] (Two other couples are waiting) No. No, Radue. They can't have her. I will never let her go. [Bridge] I promise you, they'll have a beautiful life with us. And they'll be father and mother to a new breed born of an ancient culture. Of course they're well. What are you all doing here together? (She reaches for Alexandria, but Wesley picks her up instead) What is going on here? [Bridge] No. Wait. Don't send them back yet. What if they're right? Instead of the children being our hope, what if we're just condemning them to our fate? As are we. But hear them out. The Captain and Doctor Crusher are saying that the very thing which has given us this wonderful world is what has caused this tragedy. What are we going to do with it?
