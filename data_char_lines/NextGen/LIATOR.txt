Please, enjoy what we have. [11001001 - Bourbon Street Bar]
(a man) A pleasant day to you. Slowly, slowly. I must also welcome this lovely one. (He nuzzles Troi's neck, she just pats his shoulder) Nice to see you again. Whatever pleases you. We can discuss it at the Council Chambers. And you? (Troi blushes) Yes, I can see that you do. You don't have to. Our rules are simple. No one does anything uncomfortable to them. Rivan, perhaps they can't run. Children, we've brought you a new friend! Please enjoy what we have! (And the team are lead away to - whatever) [Bridge] Once they did. Long, long ago there was much disorder. But not now. The punishment zone. An area that's selected for a period of time. No one but our Mediators know what place or for how long. We're very proud of the wisdom of our ancestors. No person ever knows where or when a zone will be. Only one punishment for any crime. The law is the law. Our peace is built on that. You're the Captain. We're ready. This way, please. (Benches have been arranged in a circle. Picard has a chair to himself) Welcome to our world, Captain. We regret that our system of justice is troubling you. Good, so do we. Our precepts have been handed down from long ago. The tranquillity you see in our lives has been made possible by our laws. Do you execute criminals? So, we are not yet as advanced as they are. And since you are advanced in other ways too, I suggest you use your superior powers to rescue the Wesley boy. We will record him as a convicted criminal out of our reach, an advanced person who luckily escaped the barbarism of this backward little world. Until sundown? God is said to be somewhere up there, protecting us. But when God wants to show its power, it can make itself felt most fully. You have our word. Of course. (Picard and Crusher beam in. Rivan goes over and kneels, handing back his communicator) We did not ask you to come here. Our laws have been violated. What of justice?
