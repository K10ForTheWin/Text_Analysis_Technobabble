I am Secretary Kushell from the Legation of Unity of the planet Straleb. We know who you are, Captain Picard. We have been monitoring your communications, and we know of the demands made by Debin of planet Atlec. You only have to concede to one demand. It is a word I have chosen. We demand you turn Okona over to us immediately. I have no interest in their request, but we intend to back up our legal right to Okona. Our honour and prestige are at stake. We are prepared to take Okona by force and die in the doing of it if necessary. Here you are, Debin, trying to save this criminal. It is if it involves Okona. He is a thief. He stole the Jewel of Thesia. A national heritage. He is mine. I do. My son Benzan and I. He used you to become my friend. He used my son to plunder a national treasure. Excellent.
