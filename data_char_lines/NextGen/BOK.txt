Is this the Captain Picard? I know you, Picard. I am Bok, DaiMon of the Ferengi. I have asked you here to discuss a mutual problem, Captain. I insist on speaking of that matter in person. Shall we meet on your vessel or mine? (Troi signals the transmission cut) As you wish, Picard. Perhaps this will begin a new era of cooperation for both our peoples. In one Earth hour, then?
I trust you remember me, Picard, because I haven't forgotten you or how you murdered my son. For fifteen years now I've thought about how to avenge his death but nothing I could do to you could equal what you did to me, until now. You thought you could hide him from me, didn't you? But I found out about him. Jason Vigo is as good as dead. I'm going to kill your son, Picard, just like you killed mine. (hologram ends) Picard, can you hear me? (Picard wakes to see Bok at the foot of his bed) I will kill him, Picard. And there's nothing you can do about it. If you want me to stay and talk, you'd better not call for security this time. How do you like your boy, Captain? Is he everything you'd always hoped for? Oh, and how do you propose to do that, Picard? You murdered my son. You were in Ferengi space! How touching. Your apology is worthless to me. I demand that you repay me for my loss. Oh, but you can, Picard. You can pay me with your son's life. You don't have any choice. I insist on being paid. (Bok beams out) [Sickbay] What kind of deal? I understand your desire to live, but I want Picard to see your body so there will be no doubt. (Picard beams in) Lower yours or your son dies. Shut up. They had no right to do that to me. They won't attack us with you on board.
