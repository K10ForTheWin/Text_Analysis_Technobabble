I am Commander Sirol of the Romulan vessel Terix. To whom do I have the honour of speaking? Captain Picard. I've heard so much about you. A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I hope our sudden appearance didn't startle you. I am touched by your concern for my ship, but I doubt we were ever in any danger. May I ask what you are doing in this system? We are conducting a survey of gaseous anomalies. I doubt our objectives are compatible. This has been a most pleasant conversation, but we must return to our research. Captain, you seem to be in a very unfortunate circumstance. How can we help? I'm not sure. We were conducting some geological experiments on the surface of the asteroid. It is entirely possible that we accidently sealed you in. If only we had known you were beneath the surface, if you had shared your plans with us, this might have been avoided. I don't want anything, Captain, but I will offer to help you. By transporting your crew aboard my ship. We'll take you back to Romulus where, after a short stay as our guests, you will be returned to the Federation. As you wish. We will be continuing our research in this system for a while longer. I await your decision. (transmission ends)
