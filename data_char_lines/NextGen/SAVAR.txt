Greetings Enterprise. I am Admiral Savar. This is Admiral Aaron, and I believe you already know Admiral Quinn. Of course. We are always delighted when the Enterprise returns to the nest. Yet we are puzzled by the timing of your visit. Excuse us for one moment, Captain. Forgive the delay, Captain Picard. We'd be delighted if you and your First Officer would join us for dinner. It would give you a good opportunity to expatiate your viewpoint. Excellent. Preparations are already underway. Welcome home, Captain Picard. Yes, I'm sure he will. We've prepared a special meal in your honour. Yes, a quiet night. [Guest quarters] The Horatio. (Picard does not drink) Absolutely. Implosion, due to extreme negligence on the part of her Captain. Except, of course, in paranoid delusions for those who believe. Of course, Captain. We'll wait for you at the table. (Picard is left alone) No matter. The Doctor will soon be joining us. All in good time. (Tryla Scott enters) Well, Captain Scott. Good. Now the setting is complete. Patience is one of our virtues, Captain. We didn't go after you, we allowed you to come after us. It's not important. Let us just say we've come a long way to join you. Indeed. We've been moving slowly, cautiously, for many months now. Careful to cover our tracks. Careful not to arouse suspicion, until it's too late. Eat hearty, brother! Relish your new body! (Riker takes a handful of mealworms, and is about to eat them when instead he draws his phaser and shoots the other person sitting opposite. Picard disarms Tryla Scott so Riker can shoot her, Aaron runs out, the parasite leaves Tryla and Savar neck-pinches Riker. Picard shoots Savar before Riker passes out)
