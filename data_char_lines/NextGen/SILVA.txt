Is it you? Yes, Geordi. It's mom. There's no time to explain. We have to go down. The surface. [Laboratory] We're dying. We need your help. I need your help. Geordi Hello, Geordi. I'm not really with you, Geordi. I'm on my ship, on the surface. We were pulled into a warp funnel. We found a way to send a subspace signal that could cut through the atmospheric interference. We need your help. Why? We're running out of time. Thank God? We're going home. You were too busy with work. No, Geordi, don't, please. Thank God. We're still too far away. You're killing us. We must go down. Geordi. We're safe now. Goodbye. (she turns into flame and goes through the bulkhead. BANG!)
