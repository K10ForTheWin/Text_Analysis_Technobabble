I saw your father last week and your sister about ten days before that. I decided I missed my favourite son. You're going to have to see the Hera again. We've got a lot of new faces on board, including a Chief Engineer who juices up the nacelles every chance she gets. I think she's the best technician in the fleet. Okay, second best. (doorbell) Maybe you should meet her. We're going to be in the same sector next week. Take a shuttle over and I'll introduce you. But if you're too busy, I'll see you at your father's birthday party. Remember, if you talk to him it's a surprise. (message ends) Is it you? Yes, Geordi. It's mom. There's no time to explain. We have to go down. The surface. [Laboratory] We're dying. We need your help. I need your help. Geordi Hello, Geordi. I'm not really with you, Geordi. I'm on my ship, on the surface. We were pulled into a warp funnel. We found a way to send a subspace signal that could cut through the atmospheric interference. We need your help. Why? We're running out of time. Thank God? We're going home. You were too busy with work. No, Geordi, don't, please. Thank God. We're still too far away. You're killing us. We must go down. Geordi. We're safe now. Goodbye. (she turns into flame and goes through the bulkhead. BANG!)
