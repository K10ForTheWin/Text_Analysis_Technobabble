The key lies in adjusting the lattice structure direction. This modification will be integrated into the next class starship. The dilithium crystal chamber was designed at outpost designated Seran T One, Stardate 40052. Some of the Federation's best engineering minds participated in its development. Theoretically, yes. The system should be able to accept more reactants at a faster rate of injection.
Point two. (shudder) [Engineering] Point oh eight. [Engineering] Now at point oh two centimetres.
