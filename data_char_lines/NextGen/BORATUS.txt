(the male alien) Could we have been mistaken? We come from the twenty seventh century. We travelled three hundred years into the past to find you. Yes. It was invented by a scientist named Kal Dano in the mid twenty seventh century. The Uthat is a quantum phase inhibitor capable of halting all nuclear reaction within a star. Criminals attempted to steal the device, so he fled back to the twenty second century where he hid it. Ajur and I were the security team assigned to retrieve the Uthat. Yes. When we returned we began to search through the historical records for some clue to the Uthat's fate. You will find such a device, Captain. To us, it is already part of history. Our being here is proof enough. You will return what is ours. History recorded that you destroyed the Uthat.
