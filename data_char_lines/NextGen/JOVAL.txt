Return. (the ball goes back to her) My apologies. I fear I have yet to master the art of hoverball. My name is Joval. I am employed here. Is there anything you require to make your stay a more pleasant one? (Picard shakes his head) You find me amusing. And afterward? Then may I suggest a swim to be followed by a massage? I don't understand. You say you wish to be alone yet you carry the Horga'hn. The Horga'hn is the Risian symbol of sexuality. To own one is to call forth it powers. To display it is to announce you are seeking Jamaharon. Do you seek Jamaharohn? I see. Someone close to you? Someone you love? Your attitude is most puzzling. I will leave you now to your book.
