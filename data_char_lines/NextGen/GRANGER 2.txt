Welcome to Mariposa. I'm Victor Granger, Minister of Health. A pleasure. I'll escort you to the Prime Minister. This way please. Your arrival really is serendipitous. Well, perhaps I'll let the Prime Minister to explain that. (Three identical women are standing by a desk) Doctor, is your title scientific or medical? Ah, excellent. I think it best if the, er Yes. Excuse me. Gentlemen? Please, follow me. (Pulaski runs a secret scan on another man as Worf and Riker catch up with them) This way please. Doctor. [Granger's office]
