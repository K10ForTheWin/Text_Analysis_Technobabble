Engineering to Captain Picard. [Engineering] We have something wrong with warp drive circuitry, sir. [Bridge] I believe it was a rampant electronic short that jumped from system to system, sir. But the only thing is, er That shouldn't be possible. The affected systems don't generally interact with each other. And where they do, it wasn't an interlink that was malfunctioning. With all the Engineering staff, sir. They're just as puzzled. But, sir. We have lost the warp engine computer tie. [Bridge] It bleeds warp engine commands off into dead ends. Excellent. I believe I can handle it from here, Mister Crusher. You are scheduled for class work now. Sorry. I tend to agree, but the captain's orders on this are very clear. [Crusher's quarters]
