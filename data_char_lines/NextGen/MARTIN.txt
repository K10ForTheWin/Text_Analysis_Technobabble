Sickbay to Captain Picard. Counsellor Troi has regained consciousness. She's asked for you, sir.
(an older man) This is a mistake, Aaron. Anything that would keep them out of here. We have a great deal to lose. (transporter sound) What is that? It would be suicide to evacuate. It would destroy everything we've worked for two centuries to accomplish. We have immeasurably extended the potential of humanity, physically, psychologically. We have evolved beyond, beyond Frankly, yes. No one in this society would be blind, for example. No offence intended. Yes. Well, my point was just. Your presence here has already begun to affect the entire balance of our society. No. This is in direct violation of the intentions of our founders, Aaron. Her absence will create an additional imbalance. We have no idea how molecular transport will affect her DNA. Can it be repaired? You would ignore the welfare of the colony for your own selfish interests. She has been contaminated by the people on that ship. (Troi and Picard enter) This is your doing. We should never have answered your hails. You are not taking her with you. I think it would be helpful if I. But You are the ones who are causing pain and anguish in this colony. You.
