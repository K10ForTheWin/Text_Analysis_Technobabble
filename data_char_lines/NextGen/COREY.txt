Nicely done. (a red-haired young man) Yes. Boy, she must've hit you pretty hard. Of course, you deserved it. Come on, he's just playing for sympathy now. Look, I'm going to get something to eat and head over to the casino at Bonestell. You coming? Come on, Marty. I bet he's got another date. Try not to end up in the hospital. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. Nah, this is nothing. A little trigonometry, some minor wrist action. Now barokie, there's a game. I think I could be persuaded to play one more game. Why? So can I. What's gotten into you? Let's go. I've played a lot of dom-jot in a lot of places. I've never seen the balls roll that well for anyone. I'll bet you that he had some sort of magnetic device in his belt. It was controlling the balls. We've got to get even. Well, we could do to him what he did to us. Cheat. Only this time we'll rig the table so his device'll backfire on him. It'll teach him that he can't go round cheating Starfleet officers. I can handle him. Well then I guess that when I'll have to depend on my friends to help me out. When did you start backing away from a good fight? Ow! Johnny, don't sneak up on me like that. I thought you were the gambling foreman. I'm glad you're here. Hand me that magnaspanner. You sound like my mother. You are my mother. Well gee, Mom, I guess I'll have to go tell those Nausicaans I don't mind if they cheat me. It better be. Now, I'm going to finish my work here. If you want to help me, fine. If not, I'll see you back at the Starbase. Are you going to hit me, Johnny? All right. Have it your way, Ensign Picard. [Starbase - Marta's quarters] So I hear. What did you say? Why don't we find out. I don't know who you are any more, but you're not my friend.
