Why was your ship combative with another Federation vessel of lesser design? Why do you now protect your former target? What is its value to you? Your answers will dictate our response. Our probes indicate that you are crippled, and the ship you protect has no weaponry, no light speed drive, and only a scarce crew. I am Bractor, leader of the Ferengi attack vessel Kreechta. I shall have the secret of the other Federation ship. Surrender it to me, and I will allow your Enterprise to leave unharmed. You have ten of your minutes. I will wait no longer, Picard. You are a fool. I did not think the Federation had such iron. As you are ours to destroy. Maximum shields! We have been outmanoeuvred. Retreat! (The Ferengi ship turns on a sixpence and whizzes off leaving an orange wake)
