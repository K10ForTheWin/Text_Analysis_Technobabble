A new face. And what would you like to hear? Look at me, Mister. What do you think? Seven different shades of them. How about some Andorian blues? Suck salt? Good for you. Nasty habit. So who are you looking for? Your face. Your uniform. In a place like this. Oh, you just made my day. Well, it was nice while it lasted. Which husband? Oh, you must be from the Enterprise. You destroyed his ship. His one endearing quality, he always cleaned up after himself. And what do you want from me? And why should I help you? Well, you did kill my ex-husband, and that's not a bad start. So why don't you drop a few coins in the jar and I'll see what I remember. Well, you don't offer much, do you? Oh, just what I need. Another set of hands. You already have. You going to be around for a couple of days? Sooner or later, a man named Omag will come by for a song. Always wants to hear the same thing, Melor Famagal. (she shudders) He's an arms trader. A fat Ferengi. [Romulan office] I don't get a lot of requests for it. I may be a little rusty. (with a pounding discord, she starts to sing an aria, and Worf joins in. A fat Ferengi enters with a tall thin female on each arm) Yes, yes, I know.
