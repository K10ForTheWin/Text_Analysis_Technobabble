Wesley Crusher? I am Lakanta. I have known that you were coming to us for the past two years. Two years ago, I went into the Habak and began a vision quest. While I was there I saw many things, talked to many animals, many spirits. And I saw you. I know why you came to us, Wesley. To find the answers that you seek. [Picard's quarters] Since you beamed down. I don't know. Answers to your questions. The Habak is holy to us. We hold our rituals and our ceremonies there. It's sacred to us. What's sacred to you, Wesley? Look around us. What do you think is sacred to us here? Everything is sacred to us. The buildings, the food, the sky, the dirt beneath your feet. And you. Whether you believe in your spirit or not, we believe in it. You are a sacred person here, Wesley. So, if you are sacred, then you must treat yourself with respect. To do otherwise is to desecrate something that is holy. Only you can decide that. Then perhaps it's time for your own vision quest to begin. [Meeting room] This is the Habak, the focal point of our lives. Strangers are not welcome here. You're not a stranger. I told you, I've seen you here before. They are Mansara. Dolls that represent the different spirits that come to this place. Yes. Our culture is rooted in the past, but it's not limited to the past. (He scatters sand around the fire) The spirits of the Klingon, the Vulcan, the Ferengi come to us just as the bear and the coyote and the parrot. There's no difference. Start the fire. Then sit and wait. This is your journey, Wesley. I can open the door, but only you can go through it. [Ready room] I didn't do anything. You did. You pulled yourself out of their time. You took the first step, Wesley. To another plane of existence, another way of thinking. You've found a new beginning for yourself. The first step on a journey that few humans will ever take.
