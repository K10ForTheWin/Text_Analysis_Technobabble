Shh. He's dead. (Anna leaves) (later, Anna has returned and is sitting by the fire. She is wearing a pendant with a similar design to a device Voval was wearing) No. I was a passenger. We crashed. Anna. I don't know. You can't see the sun from here. I've lost track of all time. Stardate 40812. Years? Seven years? I thought one, maybe two. How could it be seven? Leave? Don't move. it's bad. You have three broken ribs. The restrictor device will hold the bones in place, let them It's been so long since I talked to anyone. I used to talk to myself, but then I thought it might mean that I was crazy, so I stopped talking. It'll be a while before you can walk. I can do that. Don't move. I'll be back. [Observation lounge] What are you doing? You should be in bed. For your protection. There are dangerous animals here. Come sit down. Look, I have the comm. panel. It wasn't easy. I had to force it out of the equipment bay. What's the matter? I used a phaser to cut it free. Maybe I accidentally damaged it. You can fix it, can't you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't believe I did that. That I damaged our only chance. I've waited for so long. At first, I had hoped that I'd be rescued. I kept setting up microfusion flares and looking up at the sky and waiting for someone to come and take me away. But it never happened. There's a precipice near here. I used to go there and stare down at the gorge and I'd think, I can just step over the edge and end it all. And then I realised it was the hope that was driving me crazy, that I had to accept that I would never get out of here. I knew from the moment I saw you that you were here to save me. I'll do anything you want. Just don't leave me. I don't ever want to be alone again. (Anna kisses Picard) I love you. (later, Picard is working on some equipment when Anna comes in) I found some coltayin roots. They're not much to look at but they taste good. What are you doing? You're going to hurt yourself. Well, I'd say this is cause for celebration. I may still have some Terellian spices around here, and I'll boil these roots and make us a nice broth. If we ever do get out of here, will you promise to show me this starship of yours? This Enterprise? I meant what I said before. I do love you. How can you say that? Of course I love you. So you're not attracted to me. I understand, and I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable. No. We can't leave right now. The plasma storms are too strong. It's dangerous. Wait a few hours, then we can go. Jean-Luc, it's a difficult journey. The restriction field will make it very hard for you to walk. No! You can't remove it yet. No! (Picard pulls the device off his side) Jean-Luc. Please, I love you. Jean-Luc. I was afraid. I didn't want you to leave me. I was scared. I wanted you to stay, to love me. No. (she kisses him) Don't fight me. You should love me now. We're together. We depend on each other. I know more about you. Love me. I've failed. You don't love me. It's over. Stay away from me. I don't care. I'll jump unless you promise to love me. Jean-Luc, what are you saying? Tell me you love me. I must know. Jean-Luc. Tell me about your love or I'll jump!
