How's he progressing? Then I see no other choice. We'll have to perform the synaptic reconstruction. It's not a phaser, it's a knife. You stole it from one of the food trays. Give it to me. We don't want you to hurt yourself. (Riker's temple starts bleeding again.) It's very complicated. I'll answer all of your questions, but first I want you to put that down. There's a lot more going on here than you realise. Listen to me. We can still save you, but you must stop fighting us. (Riker's head hurts) Let me help you. I'm warning you. He's conscious! I haven't finished the neurodrain. Get him sedated. (Riker hits the assistant, rips the thing out of his head and leaps for a table where he grabs the nisroh and pendant)
