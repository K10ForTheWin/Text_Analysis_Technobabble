Which would seem to confirm our suspicion. Were you able to establish a pathology, Doctor? I heard you, Captain, and the prognosis is alarming, but my immediate concern is our children. They represent years of advanced genetic research. You must evacuate them as soon as possible. But the children have been in protective isolation since this was detected. They show no symptoms. You cannot leave them here to die! Oh, Doctor Pulaski. I can only tell you how much I regret the burden we've imposed on you. On both of you. I still can't believe you were infected by one of our children. You don't understand. They were designed to resist disease. Let me show you something. (They go up some steps to an observation window on the Isolation lab. Seven 'children' are playing games) Our ultimate achievement. The oldest is twelve, and all are telekinetic. Watch. (A chess piece glides to an upper level of the three-d board) Not engineered, created. Perfect in every way. Their body structure, their musculature, their minds. That was our masterpiece. We gave these children an aggressive immunity. The rest of us were infected by the supply ship, but they were protected. Yes, he was one of the crewmen who came in direct contact with us. Their immune system would release an active antibody that would attack the virus. Their immune systems don't wait for a disease to attack the body. It would seek out an airborne virus and destroy it. The antibody would adapt itself to alter the genetic code of the virus. We don't have time for that. Genetic analysis could take months. Trigger?
