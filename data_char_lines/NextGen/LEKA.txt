I'm afraid you're correct, Captain. The situation's growing progressively worse. (Crusher enters) Ambassador. thank you for coming. I knew your father. His efforts helped keep our people at peace for several generations. The people on our moons have been in discord ever since they migrated from our planet five centuries ago. To us on the planet They're like two squabbling children. We try to help settle their arguments by not taking sides, but this time we are at a loss. Yes, but the Beta moon is now suffering some environmental damage as a result. (the monitor shows the Beta moon's orbit is inside that of Alpha) Alpha is unwilling to give up its new-found energy source. Beta accuses them of intentionally courting genocide. Our efforts to reach a compromise have failed. And now, we have received intelligence that both sides are arming for war. If that happens the people of my planet will begin to take sides, and the outcome can only be disastrous. I would not recommend it. There are many radical factions involved in this dispute. It would be difficult to guarantee your safety. They will perceive you as a Starfleet officer, perhaps with your own agenda. I will try. I cannot promise they will listen. They are more factionalised than ever. Listening is a skill which seems to have evaporated with the heat of argument. I will do what I can. (transmission ends) May I present Kalin Trose of Alpha Moon, and Lathal Bine of Beta Moon.
