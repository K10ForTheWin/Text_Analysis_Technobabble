I can't believe he's really gone. I keep thinking he's going to show up and tell me there's been some kind of terrible misunderstanding. If that's true, then how could he leave me like this? Two nights ago. We were planning our next shore leave together. No, not really. He did say something about work, about Lieutenant Nara, but it wasn't anything serious. Yes. Dan sensed that she, well, that she felt threatened by him. That she thought he was after her position. No, but he was very sensitive to other people's moods. He used to look at me and know exactly what I was feeling. I always loved that about him. He used to tease me that when I met her, I wouldn't be able to get away with anything. Dan and I knew each other for over two years, but we didn't get together until a few months ago. We took it slow. We thought we had all the time in the world. Something must have happened to him, Counsellor. Something terrible, because it's not like Dan to take his own life. Please, find out what it was. [Nacelle control] Thanks for your help, sir. Excuse me, sir. About the quarantine field in the cargo bay? It looks like we'll need a second field generator. Yes, it was. You were wonderful. The bone fragments are definitely human. I sequenced a DNA sample. I'll see if I can match it to Starfleet records. (Worf goes to stand over Calloway at the console) Accessing Starfleet personnel records. (Worf and Calloway talk under the dialogue, and Troi keeps looking at them) Sir, I think we've found a match. I'm trying to find a picture of her in the records. Maybe there was some kind of an accident. He's dead! You killed him!
