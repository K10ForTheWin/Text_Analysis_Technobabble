It's been five months since Marc's accident. I haven't missed a single hour of my duties. I volunteered for extra time in the nursery. My language studies are better than they've ever been. Somebody else might have given in, but I didn't. Death is a normal part of life. Maybe some of us are better at facing that than others. What do you mean? But I feel fine. You keep excellent records, Deanna. Last night. I dreamt Marc was with me, celebrating. I was so glad that this nonsense was finally over. Then I woke up. Alone. And I knew that he was dead. For the first time, I knew it. I looked around for anything that belonged to him. Anything. I forgot that after the funeral I told them to take it all away. What in the world was I thinking? (Troi gets a wooden box from a cupboard) How did you know? (and bursts into tears) [Bridge] I promise I'll come by to see you tomorrow. Deanna, are you alright? You faded out there for a second. Tomorrow. Thank you, Deanna. (Troi staggers back into her office proper with a vicious headache) [Bridge] That's how I feel. She's not holding anything back any more. I let it all out last night. I cried for two hours. I realised that I had never accepted the loss of my husband. I worked hard, I kept busy, I did everything to pretend it never happened. Completely. Of course. I'm so sorry. Do you want me to come back? All right. No. You're wrong. I feel better today than I have in ages. You're absolutely wrong, Deanna. [Observation lounge] Why? Deanna, you were right about me. I had to go back and look at what I was doing, see why I was trying to convince myself and you that I was a new woman. You made me realise I was doing exactly the same thing to myself as I was before. Trying to hide from the pain. Maybe you couldn't sense what I was feeling, but you helped. [Ready room]
