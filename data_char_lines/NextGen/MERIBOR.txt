(a fine young woman) Happy day, father. You're the one who taught me. Don't complain if you've turned me into a scientist. Analysing soil samples. There isn't any anaerobic bacteria. The soil is dead. This isn't just a very long drought, is it, Father? I have entries in my log that go back ten years. You have data preceding that for fifteen years. You've reached the same conclusion, I know you have. A good scientist functions by hypothesising and then proving or disproving that hypothesis. That's what I did. You are changing the subject. You've taught me to pursue the truth, no matter how painful it is. It's too late to back off now. This planet is dying. I don't think you mean that. Father, I think I should marry Dannick sooner rather than later, don't you? I love you, Father. [Bridge] Some children are certainly making a lot of noise in here. I'm wearing plenty of your skin protector. They're sending up a missile, Father. We're going to watch it. Who? Please come, Father. You know about it, Father. You've already seen it.
