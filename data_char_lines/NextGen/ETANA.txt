You don't need that. Commander Riker to the Enterprise. I've a terrible problem down here on Risa. Go get it. Believe it. (they end up on the couch and she produces a device like a headset, but instead of ear pieces it has arms that jut out in front of the eyes) It's a game. Everyone here's playing it. It's fun. Open. (lasers shine into his eyes) The playing field. (a blue horn and a red disc) See the disc and the cone? Concentrate. Make the disc go into the cone. Just let go. Relax. You'll do it. (the first one misses, the second is a success, and he gasps with pleasure) Your reward for clearing the first level. As far as you can take it. Would you like to go for level two? (two horns and two discs and more pleasure without effort) Captain's log, stardate 45208.2. Commander Riker has rejoined the Enterprise from Risa, and we are on our way to an uncharted area called the Phoenix Cluster. We're all anticipating this historic first look at the region. [Bridge] Report. The expansion will proceed as follows. Commander Riker, you will pilot a shuttlecraft to the Cleon system, where you will rendezvous with the starship Endeavour. Proceed with distributing the device to that vessel. Commander La Forge, Counsellor Troi, take a shuttle to Starbase sixty seven. Distribute the device to all starships currently docked there. Excellent. See to it. The Ktarians commend your efforts, Picard. Once the expansion is complete, you and your crew will be rewarded. [Turbolift] (Alyssa is in the lift, playing the game) Explain yourself, Picard. Release us immediately, or we will open fire.
