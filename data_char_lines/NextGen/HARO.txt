Captain. Captain Picard. We studied your missions at the Academy Mitena Haro, first year cadet, Starfleet Academy. The same thing happened to me, sir. I was alone, studying and I fainted. When I came to, it was about three days ago. Captain Picard is letting them know we comprehend mathematics by tapping out the first six prime numbers. I couldn't say, Captain. I'm certainly not special. I am just one cadet. Impulse propulsion systems. I'm very good with field coils. I don't know. Maybe. But if they needed an engineer, sir, why didn't they take a real one? Why pick a Starfleet cadet? That's right. But this doesn't look like Moropa technology and, even assuming the Moropa wanted me, what would they want with either of you? I am Mitena Haro, of Bolarus Nine. I'm not a child. A little. And the least modest. We've been kidnapped, locked in a room. You don't think that's mistreatment? The design is simple. Cross-circuiting the door mechanism should be easy. Yes, sir. (She flips a few connections then reaches up inside the wall) I think I've got it. (The door opens an inch, closes again, then a green light hits the three. They fall to the floor in pain) You did try to talk us out of attempting to escape. I was hit, too. Captain Picard's put his life at stake for others many times. The primitive culture on Mintaka Three, the Wogneer creatures in the Ordek Nebula. (the penny has dropped for Picard) Right. Helping to cure the Phyrox Plague. But sir, how can we trust each other? I may have overloaded it, sir. (Picard and Esoqq try to prise the doors further apart) I don't understand. Sir, I've been trying to help. Captain. You are correct, Captain Picard. (And she morphs into three balls of light which then become three identical aliens with the same voice)
