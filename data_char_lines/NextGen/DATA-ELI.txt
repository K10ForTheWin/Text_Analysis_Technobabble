Oh, now isn't that a shame? Poor Sheriff's been injured. What's the matter? Was my pa a little too rough on you? What? Temper, temper, Sheriff. My pa ain't going to like if I come home all bruised. Can I help you with somethin? (there's a knock at the door. Troi lets Worf in) Pa? Real bad, pa. They ain't fed me since I got here and the Sheriff's been roughin up on me somethin fierce. Don't know. She ain't said her name. But she's in cahoots with the Sheriff and she's mighty mean with that Winchester.
