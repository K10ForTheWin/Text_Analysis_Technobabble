And him? The one I saw before, with the head? Excuse me, could someone please tell me what's going on here? I don't remember anything about that. Yeah, I've heard of it. I just never gave it much thought. How did we get here? It must have been my husband, Donald. If it was new and foolish, he would have popped for it. Well, I'll say this for it. It's the first thing he's ever bought into that worked. What's going to happen to us? Do we stay here with you? Do we go back to Earth? I don't know. It just started and it won't stop. I keep thinking about my boys. They sent you here to settle me down? The local shrink. It doesn't matter. I can't stop crying. I miss my sons, and then I think I'm here, but they are gone. Donald, that's my husband. I love that man but, good intentions aside, he'd mess up a free lunch. Why on Earth he ever decided to do this? No, I can tell you exactly what happened. He couldn't think about going on alone. I died and he couldn't face it, so he figured if he had me frozen, then in his mind I wasn't really gone. It sounds crazy, but you had to know Donald. I wish I knew what happened to my children. Did they get married, did they have kids? Tommy. He's eight, and Eddie's five. They were born in Secaucus, that's in Jersey. Can this really work? Can this tell me what's happened to them? Well, whether we do or not, I want to thank you for trying. Date of birth. Tommy was born February seventeenth [Sickbay] This is amazing. It's all right here. Everyone I've ever known is dead. Do you mind? I'd like to be alone. How did he do that? That's my son's name. My son's name is Tommy. Oh, my God. That's Donald. That's my husband. He's the spitting image. No, I'll be out of time. A relic. There's no denying that. [Observation lounge]
