What is that dreadful noise? It sounds like a Bardakian pronghorn moose. You know what I want to hear. Where's the waiter? Is there a waiter in this sorry place? Yes. I need more napkins. What did you say? Who are you? Am I supposed to stand up and salute? Well you've got the wrong Ferengi. I never trade in Vulcan ships. Who would want a Vulcan ship? Vulcans are pacifists. I deal in warships. Can somebody get me a napkin? Hypothetically speaking? I never learned to speak hypothetical. (so Riker tips Omag's dinner onto his lap then grabs him by his lapels) Are you crazy? I delivered it to a Barolian freighter. I don't remember. Ow! Watch it! You're stretching my neck. At Galorndon Core. Near the Neutral Zone. That's all I know. I swear it.
