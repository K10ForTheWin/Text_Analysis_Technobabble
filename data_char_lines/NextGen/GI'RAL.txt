Who is this? (an old woman) He must leave at once.
He must leave at once. We were captured. It was worse than death. We had no choice. We were defending an outpost on the perimeter. The Romulans took out our shields. The next blast rendered us unconscious. When we awoke, we were prisoners, unarmed and shackled. The Romulan Commander Tokath thought he was being kind. And when it was clear that we would be of no use to them, Tokath offered to let us go. We asked Tokath to let us stay and he took pity on us. All that matters is that our families are not dishonoured. Ba'el! Come here! I told you not to speak with him. Ba'el! Take that off at once. They are not needed here. Go! [Compound] (night, around the fire, and a group of teenagers are spellbound by Worf's narration) Tokath. Long ago, when your captives asked to stay here, our hope was to avoid dishonouring our children on the Home World. But perhaps, over the years, we lost sight of our children that we raised here. This is our prison. It should not be theirs.
