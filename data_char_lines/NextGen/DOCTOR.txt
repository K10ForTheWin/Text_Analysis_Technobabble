That's crazy, that's not practicing medicine.
Kamin. I'm sorry.
Just what are you doing with those lamps? There hasn't been an earthquake here in thirty years. Earthquakes. Nurse. (Crusher hides her tricorder) If you can handle things here, I've got a meeting with the Board of Patrons.
How do you feel about that person you used to be? When do you think that will be? Why do you say that? Free to go? You mean you don't think you should stand trial for what you've did? I thought you said you accepted what you'd done. How do I know you're not just telling me what I want to hear? Perhaps we should continue this discussion next week. You're starting to sound angry again. Maybe you need another treatment. You're becoming agitated.
