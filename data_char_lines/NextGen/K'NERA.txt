I am Commander K'Nera. What is your purpose in this area? That is all that is left of the crew of the cruiser T'Acog? You have him on your ship? He is alive? He is a criminal. A renegade, who with two others stole that freighter, and somehow destroyed the Klingon cruiser sent to bring them back. We expect the criminals to be delivered into our custody as soon as we are within transporter range. (ends transmission) We are in position now to receive the criminals. G'Armond T'Ris. What is it you want? You waste your time. Their actions threaten the alliance. They disobeyed and must be punished. Why do you care? It's bred in the bone. We all do. When one of us dies that way it diminishes all of us. Brother, I feel as you. I too wish they could fly free, but I have no choice. We await the transfer. He is a trained Klingon warrior, Captain. Perhaps more than you can handle. It is not a disgrace to request our assistance. Yes, Captain? May I speak with Lieutenant Worf? How did they die? They are now only empty shells. Dispose of them as you see fit. Worf, when your tour of duty on the Enterprise is complete. consider serving with us. Your training and experience would be of benefit to us, and perhaps there are some things we could teach you.
