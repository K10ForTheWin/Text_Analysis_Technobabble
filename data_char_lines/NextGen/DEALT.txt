Ah, the Enterprise, here at last. Well, good. Let's get going. To whom are you speaking? Oh I'm Lieutenant Commander Hester Dealt, Medical Trustee, Federation Medical Collection Station. Yes, but with your permission I would like to inspect the containment area before we proceed. Now it's not that I doubt the ability of your crew, but we cannot afford a mistake. Very good. I will allow access you to my computer banks, okay? (transmission ends) Something's wrong. Growth. L seven three. Very. Captain's log, supplemental. For reasons as yet unknown, one of the deadly specimens of plasma plague has begun to grow. [Bridge] I can't. We can't do that either. It will go into a spore and remain until it comes in contact with a planet or another ship. The results would be disastrous. This is not going to hold it. The rate of growth is increasing so rapidly, within thirty minutes it's going to push out of it's module. Within two hours, it'll break out of the containment area. Yes, it will. Yes, it's right over here. It could, but I. I've got something. I don't know. It wasn't here before. We may never develop one. Let's hope not.
