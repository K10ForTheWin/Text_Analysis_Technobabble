Ah, the Enterprise, here at last. Well, good. Let's get going. To whom are you speaking? Oh I'm Lieutenant Commander Hester Dealt, Medical Trustee, Federation Medical Collection Station. Yes, but with your permission I would like to inspect the containment area before we proceed. Now it's not that I doubt the ability of your crew, but we cannot afford a mistake. Very good. I will allow access you to my computer banks, okay? (transmission ends)
