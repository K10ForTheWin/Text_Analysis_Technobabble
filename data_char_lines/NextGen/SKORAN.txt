You, Ice man, where'd you find this? Jayden, huh? The metal is slightly warm. It's obviously been tempered and milled. The lustrous quality of the metal is so pure. This wasn't made in any forge I've ever seen. Will you sell them? The metal's malleable enough to make some jewellry. I'll give you twenty doraks for half the lot. We need a lever. You're getting old, Garvin. I offered you fifteen for the metal and I've given it to you. No more. Stay out of this, Ice man. Your memory is not very reliable. (Garvin doubles over) There he is! It's his fault! None of us were sick before he came to the village! That's right. And you're the cause. That's it. Leave. Get out of here. Go back where you came from! [Garvin's home] (Data has made a new microscope with multiple lenses and is working when Talur enters) There you are. You're the cause of this, Ice man. What, what are you? (they run away) I saw it with my own eyes. He's not a person. He's some kind of creature. We must find him and stop him before he kills us all. Come on. (the armed mob leaves) There he is! You see? It's just as I said. This is how you've helped us, by bringing this plague? Tried to kill us all? Well, you won't succeed. I won't let you! (Data pours the compound into the well just as Skoran impales him and gets an electric shock for his effort. Data falls as Talur arrives) [Town square] (another day, and Gia is going to school with her slate)
