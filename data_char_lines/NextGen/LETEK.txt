If he moves, kill him. We will accuse the humans of preparing to ambush us. It will be our word against theirs and who is more trustworthy, Mordoc? (the comm. badge) It looks like gold. Tastes like gold. Accursed planet! What part of the agreement? You appeared and attacked us. Are you one of their assassins? Kill them. Yes, it is true. You work with females, arm them, and force them to wear clothing. What is this? (points at Riker) Him. Deception is the way of the human. We Ferengi will gladly make a petition. We wish to offer our services to serve the Tkon Empire at no profit. Return control of our starship to us and we will happily destroy the human criminals and their vessel which attacked us without provocation. They came to loot your empire, but we intercepted them. And there is even more. We can prove that the humans are destroyers of legal commerce, and that they selfishly withhold vital technology from backward worlds. Proof of their barbarism. They adorn themselves with gold, a despicable use of a valuable metal. And they shamelessly clothe their females. They admit their crimes! Hear them! They admit the evil that they do! Yes, you show wisdom. What of our vessel? We knew the same answer.
