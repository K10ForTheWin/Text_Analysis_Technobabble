Where's my boy? No. He's more valuable to us alive. [Data's quarters] Howdy, Sheriff. The name is Frank Hollander. What are you smiling at? My boy. Well then, we'll just have to work something out. Is there anything you want in exchange for my boy? Is that so? Is that so? What about your deputy? Not so fast. I ain't in the mood for games, Sheriff. I wouldn't walk out that door if I was you, Sheriff. (So Worf dives out amid a hail of bullets from the Mexican and the outlaw) [Sheriff's office] (Troi is practicing her fast draw when Worf rushes in) I've came to see my boy. Better take a good look at that gun, Sheriff. You might be seeing it again real soon. Eli! How are they treating you, boy? Don't you worry, boy. The Sheriff's going to pay. Who's the stranger? You sit tight, boy. I'll have you home in time for supper. I'm going to give you one more opportunity, Sheriff, to avoid a ugly situation. Release my boy. I thought you might have a change of heart. Meet me in two hours. You be in front of the saloon. I'll be in front of the livery station. Strangers ain't invited. Eli, get down! Go ahead. Shoot me. Let's go. [Gold Strike saloon]
