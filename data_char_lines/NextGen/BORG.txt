(many voices speaking as one) We have analysed your defensive capabilities as being unable to withstand us. If you defend yourselves, you will be punished.
Jean Luc Picard, captain of the Starship Enterprise, registry NCC 1701D, you will lower shields and prepare to transport yourself aboard our vessel. If you do not cooperate, we will destroy your ship.
We are Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile. We must return to the Collective. We are Borg. Third of five. Third of five. Why do you do this? You are not Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile. What is a doctor? The sick and injured are reabsorbed. Others take their place. Why? You give us food. Is that your duty? Tests? You will be assimilated. We will answer. What is your designation? Third of Five. Do I have a name? A name. You You. Hugh. We are Hugh. (later, Hugh is out of the contraption looking at images on a wall monitor) This one. Here. (he takes the eyepiece off and hands it to Geordi) When you are assimilated, you will have a similar device. Why do you resist us? Here it is quiet. There are no other voices. On a Borg ship we live with the thoughts of the others in our minds. Thousands of voices with us always. When you have completed these tests, what will be done with us? We will rejoin the Collective. [Ten Forward] We are Borg. You wish to be assimilated? Resistance is futile. Resistance is not futile? What you are saying is that you are lonely. You have no others. You have no home. We are also lonely. [Science lab] What is Geordi doing? Why? Why? We assimilate species. Then we know everything about them. Is that not easier? Why? When you sleep, there are no other voices in your mind? Are you ever lonely? Friends? Like Geordi and Hugh. [Observation lounge] (on the wall monitor, topological anomaly 4747) Locutus. Why are you here? Hugh. We are Hugh. Third of Five. They do not wish it. They will resist us. Resistance is not futile. Some have escaped. Must Geordi be assimilated? He does not wish it. He would rather die than be assimilated. No. Geordi must not die. Geordi is a friend. I will not. I will not assist you. Geordi must not be assimilated. No. I am Hugh. [Observation lounge] Hello, Geordi. What I wish is irrelevant. No Borg leaves the Collective. If they find I am missing, they will come for me. You are many, I am one. What I want is not important. Choice? I could stay with you? Choose what I want? I would choose to stay with Geordi, but it is too dangerous. They will follow. Return me to the crash site. It is the only way. Yes. [Transporter room] Goodbye, Beverly. You saved my life. I must return. The Borg assimilate civilisations, not individuals. Captain, I do not want to forget that I am Hugh. Then that is where I will wait. [Bridge] Goodbye, Geordi. I will try to remember you. (Geordi walks away from Hugh, and two Borg beam in. They walk over to Hugh, who holds up his arm and they plug into him briefly. Then the three collect devices from the four corpses, which dissolve into nothing. As they beam out, Hugh looks straight at Geordi) <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

There they are! Block the exit. (vastly outnumbered by openly hostile Borg, the security man tries for a shot and gets killed)
