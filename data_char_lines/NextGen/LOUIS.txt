One man's idea of paradise. Never did I know anyone less interested in grapes than you, Jean-Luc. You always reached for the future and your brother for the past. Well, hydroponics turned out to be so dull. If I had listened to you, I never would have taken that cycling trip with the Bloom sisters. And got married twice. I'm one of two hundred supervisors, although my wife would have you believe I run the entire project. Really? I suppose we all find ways to confront our greatest fears. You really have kept up, haven't you? The truth is we don't know, yet. You know, it's such a shame. The government is looking for someone to take over the project. A real leader who'll go in there and get things moving. And they are looking for you, Jean-Luc. I know, I know, you'd never leave Starfleet. That's what I thought, but if nothing else, why don't I send over some of the internal studies of the tectonic problem, since you're interested? We could use any thoughts you might have. Robert. I'm interested to know what you thought about our plans. Wonderful. We should discuss them with the board of governors. I've set up a meeting. Just a preliminary conversation. Tomorrow morning? They want you. I mentioned your interest in the project, that's all. That's all I had to say. They jumped at the prospect. At least listen to them, Jean-Luc. You won't regret it, Jean-Luc. I promise you. I'll see you in the morning. [Crusher's office]
