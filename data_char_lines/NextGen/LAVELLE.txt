(red uniform) What could be so funny? What's so funny about crew evaluations? How can I have a good time when my career's being decided across the room? Come on. Think promotion. Promotion. Promotion. Promotion. Promotion. Promotion. Promote me, please, so I can make Lieutenant and have my own room. So, are they working on crew evaluations? Please. Hard to starboard. Sir? Aye, aye, sir. Aye, sir. What? Is that like a fly on the wall? Well apparently Commander Riker didn't think so. I swear he's got it in for me. Yeah? Then how come you're sitting in that chair instead of me? What could they be talking about? You think Worf's chewing her out? Maybe he's giving her pointers on how to land the Ops position. (Riker enters) You call him Will? He's second in command of this ship, that's why not. Riker? I bet he sleeps in his uniform. Right. No. He just doesn't like me. About what? Yeah? My grandfather was from Canada. Excuse me, I've got to go talk to somebody. (at the bar) Good evening, sir. No, sir. I just came to get another drink. No, actually, I, er. What are you having? Good choice. I'll have one, too. My grandfather was Canadian, you know. Aren't you one, too? No, Canadian, sir. Canadian. Oh. Well, they both get a lot of snow. It was good talking to you, sir. (Lavelle leaves) Excuse me, sir. If you don't mind, I'd like to stay on for another shift. I could use the training. Yes, sir. [Outside Sickbay] It must have something to do with that escape pod we picked up. Don't you think, Sito? I wonder who was in it? They beamed whoever was in it right to Sickbay. Did you see anything when you went down there? That's too bad. He must be the worst poker player I've ever met. Hey, you're a damn fine officer and you deserve that post as much as anyone. One thing's for sure, I won't be getting it. Not if it's up to Riker. [Riker's quarters] You think so? You're probably right. Maybe I'm just telling myself he hates me so that if I don't get promoted, I'll have an excuse. How could you tell I was bluffing? Goodnight. He didn't like the fact that you knew something he didn't. It depends on what kind of a guy he is. Commander. I've got to get some sleep so I can be sharp tomorrow. Goodnight. [Riker's quarters] She must have left on that shuttle. There's no other explanation. Toward Cardassian space. That's what I'm worried about. Oh, there's one other thing, I noticed the shuttle was damaged. Well don't you care what's happened to her? Well, we can at least tell each other what we know. Do you two know something? I can't believe this. We're friends. Okay. I understand. I'd better get going. I've got duty in half an hour. Captain's log, stardate 47566.7. We have reached the coordinates in Federation space where Ensign Sito's escape pod was to have rendezvoused with us. However, we have been waiting for over thirty hours and as yet there is no sign of her. [Bridge] We completed a long range scan of the area, sir. The escape pod doesn't seem to be out there. Sir, it would help if I knew what kind of life signs to look for. Yes, sir. (Picard enters) I just got promoted. Thanks. It just don't feel right. For all I know, she was going to get the promotion instead of me.
