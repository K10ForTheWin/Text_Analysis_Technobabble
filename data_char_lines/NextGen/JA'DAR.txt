Twenty three field coils, working in concert, will generate the soliton wave from this point on the planet surface. We will have our test ship towed to a position approximately two million kilometres from Bilana Three. If our theories are correct, the wave will envelop the ship and push it into warp. The soliton emits a great deal of subspace radio interference. You'll need to remain within twenty kilometres in order to receive telemetry. The wave will be directed toward Lemma Two, about three light years distance. Our sister facility there which will generate a scattering field which will dissipate the wave and bring the ship out of warp. I'll be sending you more detailed operational plans within the hour. Captain, we're ready to begin the launch sequence. This is Doctor Ja'Dar to all stations. You may begin the launch sequence. Thank you, Captain. (transmission ends) Captain, are you all right? Was anyone hurt? The preliminary data we received indicate a transient power imbalance. Are you still tracking the wave? Well, I hope you're here to see it next time we try, Mister La Forge. Have you checked the frequency resonance of the subspace Commander, at that energy level, the wave will not only destroy the colony, it'll take most of the planet with it. [Troi's office]
