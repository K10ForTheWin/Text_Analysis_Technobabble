Holmes, are you there, man? (La Forge opens the door and two men enter) Thank the Almighty you're available today, Holmes, I'm in a deuce of a dilemma. We need your help, Holmes. You see, this gentleman here, the emissary of a foreign government, has been the victim of a most accidentally wicked crime. What, dear fellow? To put the matter simply, Holmes, this man was accosted by gypsies intent on depriving him of his most valuable possessions. And in the process of picking his pockets clean, they also happened to bag a photograph this man was carrying. (Data gets up, rips the lining of the man's jacket to reveal - ) Great Scott! The photograph! Holmes! Thank God you're here. [Street] (A crowd is gathered around a body) Make way, please, make way. Make way for Sherlock Holmes. It's murder, Holmes, murder most foul. Doctor? Doctor Watson is right here, Holmes. She was with you? Is that correct, Holmes? Seize her. Astounding, Holmes. Come along. Hurry it up. Come on. (Data and Geordi leave the crime scene)
