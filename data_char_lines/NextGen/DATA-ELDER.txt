Difficult to stay warm. It's not warm enough, not for an old man. My daughter. Children grow, forget their parents. Only Korgano can talk to Masaka. So hard to stay warm. Are you one of my children? I can't remember anymore. It won't help you. Korgano no longer pursues her. Only he can stop her. (Picard takes the old man's hand and draws in the dirt) As the rolling hillside. A point as a distant bird. A ray as the rising sun. Now, come sit with me. Tend the fire.
