I would meet with your Captain. [Turbolift] I come to serve. Leave us, please. [Bridge] Caution is clearly called for, Captain. However, the mission must proceed as planned. Commander Data, this is Ambassador T'Pel. Please report to my quarters. Enter. (she sits) You have priority three clearance aboard the Enterprise? I require information on this ship's defence and navigational systems. Access code kappa alpha four six zero one seven zero four. What is the field strength of the ship's deflector shields at maximum output? I require the information. I was not interested in the information. I was curious as to your security safeguards. They appear to be adequate. Cancel the request. You may leave. [Corridor] Hold position on these coordinates. Open a channel. I am Ambassador T'Pel. There is no established protocol for a meeting of this nature. The logical course is that I transport aboard your ship and begin the negotiations. The honour is mine. (transmission ends) Have your Transporter room stand by. I will beam to their ship with no further delay. Captain Picard, I find your argument illogical. Please carry out my instructions. Sub-Commander Selok, actually. Thank you for your help, Captain.
