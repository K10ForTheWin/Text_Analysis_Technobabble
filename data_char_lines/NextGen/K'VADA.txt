Be careful, android. Some Romulan beauty might take a liking to you. Lick that paint right off your ears. You. Do you know what the Romulans will do to you if they discover who you are? We have more important things to attend to than acting as your nursemaids. Access to our computer? For what purpose? Don't bother. We've been trying for years. I cannot reveal classified Klingon entry codes to Starfleet. Anything else? You do and the Romulans will instantly know our co-ordinates. Piggy-back? It won't work. Galorndon Core is along the Barolian trade route. They trade a great deal with the Romulans. It's probably just routine.
Captain K'Vada to Picard. Please come to the bridge. [Klingon Bridge]
