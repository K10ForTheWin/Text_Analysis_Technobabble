Be careful, android. Some Romulan beauty might take a liking to you. Lick that paint right off your ears. You. Do you know what the Romulans will do to you if they discover who you are? We have more important things to attend to than acting as your nursemaids. Access to our computer? For what purpose? Don't bother. We've been trying for years. I cannot reveal classified Klingon entry codes to Starfleet. Anything else? You do and the Romulans will instantly know our co-ordinates. Piggy-back? It won't work. Galorndon Core is along the Barolian trade route. They trade a great deal with the Romulans. It's probably just routine.
I know my duty, Captain. When I am given orders, I follow them, but I do not like secrets. I want to know why we are going on this mission. You're going after the defector, aren't you? Do you think information like that stays a secret? Ambassador Spock has gone to Romulus and you are going after him. If we are discovered by the Romulans it means death for us all. Hechu' ghoS. Very well, Captain. We have set a course for Romulus. [Klingon quarters] It may not be what you're used to on a Starfleet ship. Both. We have limited space. We are a military ship, not a pleasure craft. You'll sleep Klingon style. We do not soften our bodies by putting down a pad. You'll take your meals with us but we do not serve Federation food. Jatlh! So'wl'chu'. Well, Captain, we're at the border of the Neutral Zone. You mean to do this, do you? Captain K'Vada to Picard. Please come to the bridge. [Klingon Bridge] Captain. We've monitored a subspace message that might interest you. (Picard reads the PADD) Don't you two look sweet. Be careful, android. Some Romulan beauty might take a liking to you. Lick that paint right off your ears. You. Do you know what the Romulans will do to you if they discover who you are? Just so we understand each other, my orders don't include rescue missions. [Romulan office] (Pardek, a stocky man, enters)
