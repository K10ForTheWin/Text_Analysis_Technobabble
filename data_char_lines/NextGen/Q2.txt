Not bad, Q. Not great. But not bad. (Dressed in a similar fashion, and stepping through the bulkhead. This Q looks at his hands as if they are something completely new to him) Sacrificing yourself for these humans? Do I detect a little selfless act? What a dreadful colour. I've been keeping track of you. Actually, I was the one who got you kicked out. You know, you're incorrigible, Q. A lost cause. I can't go to a single solar system without having to apologise for you, and I'm tired of it. Hey, this isn't about me. I've got better places to be. But somebody had to keep an eye on you to make sure you still didn't find a way to cause trouble. Even as a member of this limited species. Barely. But I find these humans rather interesting. I'm beginning to understand what you see in them. After all the things that you've done, they're still intent on keeping you safe. And they're still at it. They just tried to beam you up, back, whatever it is they call it. I stopped them. Afraid I had to put them on hold too. You see, there's still this matter of the selfless act. You and I both know that the Calamarain would have eventually destroyed the Enterprise to get to you. And that's really why you left, right? And there's my problem. See, I can't back to the Continuum and tell them you committed a selfless act just before the end. If I do there's going to be questions and explanations for centuries. Remember who you're talking to. All knowing, all seeing. Fine, you got your powers back. Try and stay out of trouble. (Q2 vanishes, and Q snaps his fingers. He gets himself a Starfleet uniform) Q?
