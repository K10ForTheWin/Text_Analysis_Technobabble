(red-head female alien) This is a waste of time, Baran. Get rid of him now. Starfleet won't negotiate with us, but they'll pursue us as long as we have him. (she gets a zap of pain) We're accelerating. I can't. The override sequence won't engage. What are their defences? Why would Riker help us? Just because he's out of favour with Starfleet doesn't mean that he's ready to betray them.
Understood.
