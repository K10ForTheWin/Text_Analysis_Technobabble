(red-head female alien) This is a waste of time, Baran. Get rid of him now. Starfleet won't negotiate with us, but they'll pursue us as long as we have him. (she gets a zap of pain) We're accelerating. I can't. The override sequence won't engage. What are their defences? Why would Riker help us? Just because he's out of favour with Starfleet doesn't mean that he's ready to betray them.
There's an incoming message. It's from the Klingon shuttle. It was sent approximately fifteen minutes ago. He's at the rendezvous coordinates but he's been detained by the Enterprise. That's all there is. He's stopped transmitting. Orders? Aye, Captain. [Ready room] Understood. We have entered orbit of Vulcan. She's right. I don't care what it is you want, Tallera. I don't care if that's a weapon for your personal use or if you're really just making a delivery as planned. All I care about is my money. So I propose a compromise. Narik and I will go with you to the surface to guarantee that we receive our payment. No, this is less than half of what we were promised. Where's the rest of it? (Tallera has assembled the resonator)
