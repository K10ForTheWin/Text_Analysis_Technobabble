And the android was mentioned too. What is its price? We should like to purchase it. No price? We are not selling it to him? Permission granted, Riker. It is now. Captain Bok has just made me aware of it, Riker. The infamy of your Picard is now fully known. I would call the wanton destruction of an unarmed vessel infamy. I can hardly imagine you contacted me to discuss an ancient battle. What do you want of me? As you humans say, I'm all ears. We freely give you back your derelict warship and now you accuse us of crime, Riker? I can bear no more insults! [Picard's quarters] (the doorbell chimes) Why is our gift to you under power, human? He is working in our ship's laboratory. Where is your Captain? How do you have possession of that? It is a forbidden device. A thought maker. If your Captain is criminal enough to own one It is not seemly to question one's own DaiMon, Riker. I am not prepared to do that. First Officer Kazago to human Riker. We do not wish to become involved in what has become clearly a Federation matter. You should also know that DaiMon Bok no longer commands this vessel. His First Officer has confined him for engaging in this unprofitable venture. Good luck, First Officer Riker.
