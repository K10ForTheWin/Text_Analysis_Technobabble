(a young woman) When the sun reaches its zenith, I have to be ready to take the measurements. Yes, father, but never as the appointed record keeper. (At the sun dial in front of the assembly hall - a lovely carved wooden specimen) What is that? Up there, father. What is it? (A glint of light from the duck blind) Father? Father! I thought I'd never see you again. When you and the woman vanished, I was sure you were dead. How is that possible? But those are just tales, father. Old superstitions. But it did happen, just as we've said. Who could vanish like smoke? My father and I both witnessed these beings. Perhaps he ran away. Then by keeping Palmer safe, we will please the Picard. Father, the sun's reaching its zenith. If I don't go to measure Riker? Riker, stop! [Path] (The adults hear her calling) And if they don't find Palmer? Not like this one. Nuria can't be found. No one knows where she's gone. What do we do now, father? But what if we do the wrong thing, father? Father, no! (Oji jolts Liko's arm enough to deflect the arrow into Picard's shoulder. Nuria holds up her blood-stained hand to Liko and he bursts into tears) Captain's log, supplemental. Doctor Crusher has repaired my injury with her usual skill. Mister La Forge will supervise the dismantling of the observation post after I make one last visit to Mintaka Three. [Hillside] (Picard's arm is in a sling) Then revealing yourselves was an accident. Why? There's so much you can teach us.
