I am Kareel. I am to become host to Odan. [Crusher's office] Doctor Beverly, could we talk for a moment? I've never felt better, except once or twice. My poor Beverly. This has been so hard for you. I want to thank you for your caring, for your standing by me. Yes. It seems as though everything has turned out for the best. And yes, I am still Odan, and I still love you. I cannot imagine that ever changing. Is there to be nothing more? I understand. I will never forget you. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of CBS Studios Inc.
