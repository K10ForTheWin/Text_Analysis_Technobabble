Captain, there is no more time. What must I do? I explained my motives to your interrogators. which is precisely why I chose an alternate identity here. What you call massacres were called the Norkan Campaign on my world, Captain. One world's butcher is another world's hero. Perhaps I am neither one. I cannot betray my people. Do you have any children, Captain Picard? A family? Then you have sacrificed too much for your career. There comes a time in a man's life that you cannot know. When he looks down at the first smile of his baby girl and realises he must change the world for her. For all children. It is for her that I am here. Not to destroy the Romulan Empire, but to save it. For months, I tried desperately to persuade the High Command that another war would destroy the Empire. They got tired of my arguments. Finally I was censured, sent off to command some distant sector. This was my only recourse. I will never see my child smile again. She will grow up believing that her father is a traitor. But she will grow up. If you act, Picard. If we stop the war before it begins I don't understand. But I saw the tactical communiqués. The records. Timetables for completion. An entire legion was assigned to the section. No. No. It's impossible. All the communiqués, all the timetables, all the records. They were all fiction, written for my benefit. A test. A test of my loyalty. And you used me to lure the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone. I did it for nothing. My home, my family. For nothing. [Guest quarters]
