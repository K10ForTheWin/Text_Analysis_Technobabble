This is T'Jon. I am on the Ornaran freighter (garbled). We have a serious problem here. Can't seem to fix it. We need help. (a very poor image) Whoever you are, yes! I'm having trouble navigating. We can't maintain a steady course. Please help us if you can. I can't control the helm any longer. I'm losing orbit. We're heading into the atmosphere. Please, do something. We're going to burn up. We haven't much time. Enterprise, this is the Ornaran freighter Sanction. I am T'Jon, Captain of the Sanction. We have lost, I don't know, something. I am no longer able to maintain this orbit, nor am I able to use the main thrusters. It's all, you know, dead, I guess. It's all shut down? Well, the computer's not working very well. Hey, that's, that's great. I understand. Thanks for trying. Great. Really? I don't think so. That's great. And that'll fix us up? Right. And how do we do that? Seven years. This is my twenty-sixth voyage to Brekka. It's never come up. Hold on. I'll ask. Sorry. Nobody here knows anything about it. If you think that's best. Whatever you say. [Transporter room] (Blue is playing on the transporter controls) Right, Enterprise. It's right next door. But if you can't get us with your transporter, what makes you think ours will do the job? I didn't know you could do that. We're on our way. We're in the transporter room. Did you say two eight six or eight eight six. Got it. [Bridge] We're ready. The cargo. Where is it? The cargo. May we see it? Thank you. Thank you. We thought we had lost it. We paid a fair price for it! That's not our problem. Yes, get them out of here. But the barrel stays. Damn you, Sobi. (T'Jon puts his hand on Sobi's chest and electricity sparks. Sobi returns the attack. Langor immobilises Romas when he tries to interfere) We have to resolve this soon. There isn't much time. Everything we had went down with the Sanction. Tell me, you could have repaired it. We have only two left. Neither works properly. They are critical to our survival. Will you fix them? Now, as for our cargo. Captain, you don't understand. This is a matter of life and death. Medicine. The cargo you have impounded is the only hope of life for our people. We paid for it. We are asking only for what is ours. Romas. But we are not. We need our medicine. We paid for it. It's ours now. Captain, you must give us back our cargo. Why? It belongs to us. Captain, what is happening to us, is happening to thousands more on Ornara. Please understand the magnitude of the problem. If you don't give it to us, you will be a party to murder, not only of us, but of an entire civilisation. I'm sorry, I do not mean to insult you. I'm feeling very shaky. Thank you, Captain. We appreciate anything you can do. [Guest quarters] (Langor and Sobi are relaxing and enjoying a drink when the doorbell chimes. Picard enters) No. (T'Jon puts a hypo onto the device and sets it going) Yes, thank you. I'm fine now. [Ready room] Well, it's here, but I'm doing everything I can. You see, what happened was You will take us to our planet and leave us there with our medicine or this person dies. Don't you see I have no choice? We were sent to bring the felicium back. The suffering on my planet is too great. People are dying. It doesn't matter whether we're entitled to it or not. We must have it. You will take us there now, or give us a shuttle. But we must have the medicine. If you refuse, this person will die. I will do it. I will kill him. Help us, please. Help us. Are these the spare parts for our freighters? Are they already? Right. Captain, please. My planet is suffering. Great. We thank you. That's terrific. Of course. And Captain, we appreciate your gift of the coils. No? We can't. Without the freighters, there will be no more shipments of felicium. We will die. Captain, I hope you realise what you've done to us.
You will take us to our planet and leave us there with our medicine or this person dies. Don't you see I have no choice? We were sent to bring the felicium back. The suffering on my planet is too great. People are dying. It doesn't matter whether we're entitled to it or not. We must have it. You will take us there now, or give us a shuttle. But we must have the medicine. If you refuse, this person will die. I will do it. I will kill him. [The Last Outpost] (The Ferengis are watching them. Little crouching men with whips in their hands)
