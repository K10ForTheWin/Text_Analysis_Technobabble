(a very poor image) Whoever you are, yes! I'm having trouble navigating. We can't maintain a steady course. Please help us if you can. I can't control the helm any longer. I'm losing orbit. We're heading into the atmosphere. Please, do something. We're going to burn up. We haven't much time. I am T'Jon, Captain of the Sanction. We have lost, I don't know, something. I am no longer able to maintain this orbit, nor am I able to use the main thrusters. It's all, you know, dead, I guess. It's all shut down? Well, the computer's not working very well. Hey, that's, that's great. I understand. Thanks for trying. Great. Really? I don't think so. That's great. And that'll fix us up? Right. And how do we do that? Seven years. This is my twenty-sixth voyage to Brekka. It's never come up. Hold on. I'll ask. Sorry. Nobody here knows anything about it. If you think that's best. Whatever you say.

You will take us to our planet and leave us there with our medicine or this person dies. Don't you see I have no choice? We were sent to bring the felicium back. The suffering on my planet is too great. People are dying. It doesn't matter whether we're entitled to it or not. We must have it. You will take us there now, or give us a shuttle. But we must have the medicine. If you refuse, this person will die. I will do it. I will kill him. [The Last Outpost] (The Ferengis are watching them. Little crouching men with whips in their hands)
