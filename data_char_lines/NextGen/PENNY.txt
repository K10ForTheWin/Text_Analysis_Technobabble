You're awfully quiet today. What happened to the dashing young Ensign from last night? The one with the winning smile and the smooth talk about my eyes? And what are you contemplating? I come from Rigel, my last name is Muroc and I like men in uniform. I think that's enough talking. (the older woman moves in for a kiss) What's wrong? I don't look as attractive to you as I did last night? Handsome. That's something you say to old ladies. I didn't want your pity. (Penny leaves in high dudgeon. The bartender has a new face.)
