You're welcome. Are you sure about dessert? Yep. It's not my place to say. All right, but I'm not sure you two are going to like it. Apparently, you two are up for the same job. [Bridge] No, he always looks like that. Hi, Will. Why not? I'm not Starfleet, I'm a civilian. When he's in here, he wants to be treated like a civilian. You only think that because he's your CO. If you got to know him. Why? Did you crash the ship into something? That's right. You should go talk to him. He likes Jazz, poker. He's Canadian. There you go. It's your bet, Taurik. What I can't understand is why we're just sitting here so close to the Cardassian border. You know what I heard? It was Ambassador Spock. That's what I was told. I can't say. It's your bet, Sam. (with four clubs showing, Lavelle checks his hole card and grins) [Riker's quarters] (another poker game) The bet is fifty. Yes, and I'm not going to let you get away with it. You in or not? I knew it. You don't really expect me to answer that, do you? One more hand. [Riker's quarters] Of course he was. Ante up, gentlemen. How about some blackjack? Why? So you can get promoted, have more responsibility, and have to get to sleep even earlier? I just cleaned out some junior officers and I thought I'd do the same here. Thanks. [Gymnasium] (a martial arts class has just finished) Do you have any idea where it went? You okay? You shouldn't feel that way, Sam. Excuse me, sir, but I need to move this table. There's an empty seat over there. Sir, I happen to know that she considered you a friend.
