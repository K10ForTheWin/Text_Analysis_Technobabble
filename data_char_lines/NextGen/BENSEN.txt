Where were you manufactured? Are there others like you? Remarkable. Excuse me. (The two men go back to work) Arthur. The factors do not support that conclusion. (Mandl enters) All set. I can't explain it. [Hydraulics room] Maybe Arthur stopped it, only not in time. [Hydraulics room] They are off. It's not working again. What did you do to this laser drill? A year's work destroyed! (The drill looks like the last turkey in the shop) Tell them about the pattern in the sand. When we first arrived, we noticed that in certain areas the sand had a sparkling effect, like sunlight bouncing off new fallen snow. Honestly, we did not give it any thought. At first we thought it was just a natural phenomenon unique to Velara Three. As the building of the terraforming station went forward, the patterns in the sand ceased being random and became very specific. Geometric shapes suddenly appearing, disappearing, changing location, changing size. I don't know. At the time, I didn't think so. But now, after hearing what you just said. Now, I don't know. Absolutely none. [Bridge] (working at the rear science stations)
