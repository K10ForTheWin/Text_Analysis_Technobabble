To further our knowledge of alien interaction, we borrowed you, Tholl, and Esoqq, and replaced you with replicas. Our species is telepathically linked. We are all in continual contact. We would like to pursue this study, but of course your awareness of it would taint the results. As we are all identical, distinctions among ourselves are meaningless. Hence we have no leaders no followers. (Riker taps commands into a panel) Our replicas of Tholl and Esoqq explored this issue on Mizar Two and on Chalna, just as our Picard replica did on the Enterprise. (Data follows Riker's lead and puts instructions into his console) Why not? What is it? We were merely curious. We meant no harm.
You have no jurisdiction here, Picard. Where is Riva? Who is Riva?
