(Peter Lorre accent) Mister Hill? Where are you? [Outside Holodeck] Ah, Mister Hill. You've been avoiding me. You know me, sir? You're being quite rude, Mister Hill. You haven't even introduced me to your charming companions. But we have business! (pulls a gun) Urgent business. [Hill's office] You're not going anywhere. Not until we have a little chat. [Outside holodeck] I am not a man to be toyed with, Mister Hill. You were hired to locate a certain object. I demand to know what you have done with it. I assure you, this is not a game. It will happen again if you don't cooperate. (Quickly, Picard disarms him and thumps him for good measure) You struck me! How dare you! You're going to be sorry! I promise you, Redblock isn't going to like this! (Leech runs from the office) It was Hill. (Leech pistol-whips Picard) Looks like a ghost. Where were you hatched, anyway? That's ridiculous! You're a private dick. We've met before and you never even mentioned any of this. I don't want to hear any more of this. You're making me crazy. Let me shoot them, Mister Redblock. Let me kill them, one by one. Well said, Mister Redblock. What is our purpose? Shall I kill him? But I so much want to kill her. Enough! Let me kill him. He's really beginning to irritate me. (Wesley does something, and the office briefly turns into an arctic snowstorm)
