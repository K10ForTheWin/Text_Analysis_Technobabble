Excuse me, son. Look who's talking. Man, you sound just like my ex-wife. All right. Time to get back to business! Put some chips there, mister. Yes, sirree! You're new around here, aren't you? Sit down. I'm going to teach you how this game is played, boy. Go ahead. Ante up. (Tex puts his Stetson on Data, and Data sits the other side of him) No, no, blackjack. Boy, you're right. You are right. (Data does a one-handed cut of the pack, and Vanessa whistles at his skill) Pretty smooth. Run 'em, boy. Make 'em nice and friendly. Don't look at your hand, honey. That gal has got to win. Now, honey, you got fifteen and the dealer's showing ten. If you've got to win, you've got to hit. Shoot. Hit me. Twenty one, and a winner. Yes, sirree. Do you think you've had about enough? Boy, you have got the brass. Do you know what the odds are on a five card charlie? Hell, you're just throwing your money away. How'd you? Shut my mouth. Hey, you're not one of them card counting fellas, are you? Guys, you're holding up the game. I'll watch your chips. Hey. The hat. Deal them up. [Bridge] Oh, shoot. Honey, now you know it's bad luck to count your chips at the table. Lubbock, Texas. To Vegas? Drove my car. I got a ninety one Caddy with only eighty thousand miles on it. Out front, I suppose. What the hell difference does it make? Son, why would I want to do that? Can't you see I'm trying to to help this little lady? Sure does seem that way when you're losing, don't it? We're just trying to turn this lady's wagon around, and win back some lost change. Otherwise she's in a desperate situation and she's got nowhere to turn. Well, almost nowhere. I wouldn't. Do you want a card or what? There, there, there, there, there. [Lobby] Eight's a point. Eighter from Decatur. Candy see the wise. Do it, do it. (Vanessa throws the dice. Double one.) Oh. Snake eyes. Relax, honey. It's only money Don't worry your little head, honey. I'd never let that happen. Go babe, let's go. Here they come, babe. (Vanessa rolls again) You're turn, Slick. Maybe this turkey'll bring us some luck. (Data gets Vanessa to blow on the dice, then rolls a double three) Hell, my blind grandmother can make a six. Come on, boy, roll 'em. Give Slick another shot. I got a feeling about you, boy. Eleven! Attaboy! Do that a few more times and we're all gonna get well! And another one. Keep going, boy. We got a hot one. Let's go. Let's go. (Data looks smug) Keep 'em rolling, boy. Keep rolling. Seven, a winner. [Bridge] Seven, look at that. Yeah. And I'm good lookin' too, huh? Yeah, and I'm getting off at this station. After eighteen passes, the air gets a little too thin for this country boy. I'm betting against you, fella. Hey, that's what horse racing's about. Roll 'em, boy. You knew you were going to throw that seven, didn't you? You just let me go down the tube. What was it? I mean, was it personal, or what? Because I didn't show you my car? I like you fellas. You got style. Let me buy you guys a drink. You got it. [Planet surface]
