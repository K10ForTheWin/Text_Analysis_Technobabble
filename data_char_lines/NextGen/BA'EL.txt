You are Klingon. Where did you come from? Hello again, Worf. They say you've come to stay with us. Aren't you happy to have escaped the war? Yes. We've heard the stories all our lives. How people are slaughtered in terrible battles, forced to fight whether they want to or not. That's why our parents came here, to make a safe home, a place where they could raise their children in peace. I should think you'd be relieved to get away from the fighting. You're safe here. So are we. Why would I want to go there? It's dangerous. Yes, Mother. You are not allowed to leave the compound? Then I suppose I won't be seeing you at the pond again. I'm sorry, Mother. (Worf's homing device starts beeping. He switches it off) [Worf's room] (Worf is doing something to a piece of equipment when there is a knock on the door) Bagh Da tuHmoh. ChojaH Duh rHo. ylja'Qo' ylja'Qo' ylja'Qo' No. I just like the melody. (the barrels explode. Worf makes to climb the wall) What are you doing? Mother? She's not here. Come in. This is what I wanted to show you. (She opens a chest. It contains Klingon armour amongst other items) I don't know why, but I'm not supposed to look at these things. They're Klingon, aren't they? I thought you might be able to tell me about them. Isn't it beautiful? Mother. What happened to the sword? Worf. You never answered my question. Did Kahless ever find his father's sword? The stories that you tell, are they true? This Kahless, did he ever take a mate? Tell me. (Worf strokes her hair, and discovers that she has pointed ears) Tokath is my father. I thought you knew that. Why shouldn't she? What are you saying? They love each other. My father is a good man. He is kind, and generous. There is nothing dishonourable about him. I don't know what you're talking about. My father came here to escape the wars. He would never kill anybody. What do you want? There's nothing wrong with what I am. What, being born? I'm sorry if that offends you. Not here. Here, we live in peace. Worf, before you knew, you were attracted to me. Can't you leave the hatred behind, too? Can't you accept me as I am? Father if I wanted to visit Romulus, or the Klingon Home world, would I be allowed to go? (Toq enters carrying a dead quadruped, skinned and gutted) (to the guard) Thank you. I will remove the tracking device. Then you can go over the wall and hide in the jungle. My father is wrong. No matter how I might feel about you, you don't deserve to die. They will kill you. I don't understand you. Is that really the lesson you want us to learn? You've taught us a great deal, awakened something in us that we never knew existed, but I don't understand what we can learn from your death. Worf, in spite of everything that's happened, I still sense that you care for me. Am I wrong? You talk so much about being a warrior, about honour and death. Is it so hard to speak of love? Worf, please. But you do? Well if you've come that far, can't you take it one more step? Can't you stay here with us? With me? If there is anything that I've learned from you, from your reaction to me, it's that I have no place out there. Other Klingons will not accept me for what I am. Why did you come here? We were so happy. We didn't know there was anything missing in our lives. Goodbye, Worf. [Compound] (Worf looks everyone in the eye then stands in front of the wall for the firing squad.) Father.
Who's there? Toq, is that you? I can see you. I hope you're enjoying yourself. Toq, I swear I will hang you by your (Worf stands, she starts to run) Who are you? Help me? Yes I come here often You are Klingon. Where did you come from? Home? This is my home. Is it time for the ceremony?
