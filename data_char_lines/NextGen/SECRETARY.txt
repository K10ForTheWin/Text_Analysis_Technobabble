Very funny, Dix. What'd you do, lose another bet? The bellboy suit. Are you moonlighting at the Fremont? Detective Bell, your cop friend, McNary's new partner, was here nosing around. If he'd have seen you in those threads he'd have you sent to the funny farm. Mister Leech called twice, and there's a lady named Bradley waiting in your office. Nice legs. Not you. Her. Got a hot date with my fella. See you in the morning. (She leaves, laughing. Picard opens the door to his inner office and we go into Maltese Falcon territory)
