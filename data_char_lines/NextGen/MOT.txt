there's a time when you want to call a Romulan's bluff and there's a time when you don't. Wouldn't you say? You've got to choose your time and place with them. True or false? So, this time you were lucky. I suppose all's well that ends well but if I'd been in your shoes Hold on (trims a sideburn) There. I must tell you, Captain, Will Riker was in for a trim yesterday and he agrees with me a hundred per cent. Uh oh. That's right along the Cardassian border. I told him we shouldn't colonise so close to the Cardassians. [Bridge]
She said, if they're not squirming, we won't eat 'em! (Worf enters) Ah, Mister Worf, my good Klingon. Sir, welcome. What a pleasure it is to have you with us again so soon. So, Lieutenant, haircut today? Trim your beard? Ah. A trim, of course. Oh no, just a little off the top. I took way too much off last time. I was just telling my colleague, Mister Setti, how thick and luxuriant Klingon hair is. It's such a pleasure to cut. Sometimes I get carried away. All those away missions, the wind and dry air, the elements really are harsh on the hair. I'd like to suggest that you start using a conditioning agent. (Worf sees the scissors and grabs Mot's arm) I promise, not too much off the top. (Worf leaves) [Cargo bay] (Geordi is up a ladder, looking inside a panel)
