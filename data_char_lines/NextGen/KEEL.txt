Hello, Jean-Luc. It's been a long time. It was a difficult decision. I felt it was worth the risk. It's about Starfleet. About something we've always considered to be impossible. I can't explain it now. We need to talk, face to face. Not over subspace, no. No. I want you to meet me on Dytallix B. Immediately. That can wait. You owe me. And you owe it to yourself to hear what I have to say. Something is beginning. Don't trust anyone. Remember that, Jean-Luc. Don't take anything for granted. Dytallix B. We'll be waiting. [Bridge]
