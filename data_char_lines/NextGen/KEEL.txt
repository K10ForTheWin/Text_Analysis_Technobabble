Hello, Jean-Luc. It's been a long time. It was a difficult decision. I felt it was worth the risk. It's about Starfleet. About something we've always considered to be impossible. I can't explain it now. We need to talk, face to face. Not over subspace, no. No. I want you to meet me on Dytallix B. Immediately. That can wait. You owe me. And you owe it to yourself to hear what I have to say. Something is beginning. Don't trust anyone. Remember that, Jean-Luc. Don't take anything for granted. Dytallix B. We'll be waiting. [Bridge] Thanks for coming. Tell me, Jean-Luc, where did we first meet? Do you recall the night you introduced Jack Crusher to Beverly? My brother introduced them. Captain Picard, meet Captain Rixx. And Captain Scott. Some of us have seen strange patterns emerging. Unusual orders. High-ranking officials backing irrational proposals. Or so they say. It's hard to be certain of anything. Interfleet communications are at a minimum. But something is happening. We're not sure yet. Damn it, Jean-Luc. I tell you that some of Starfleet's top command people are changing. This could affect the very core of our organisation. Officers I've known for years are bluffing their way through talk of old times. I can't say exactly, but I think its spread to my own ship. My First Officer hasn't been the same since we stopped off at Earth. Our Medical Officer says he's perfectly normal, but I don't think I trust him either. Stay in touch with us, covertly. This meeting never took place as far as Starfleet is concerned. Please, I'm asking this as a personal favour. I'm glad, Jean-Luc. I'm glad you're still one of us. Tell Beverly I said hello.
