Captain Picard. Your First Officer has described the details of the incident with the Ferengis. How is the Ambassador? A tragedy. Your willingness to assist is appreciated by both our peoples. Rituals. I am more concerned about the remaining provisions of the treaty. The proposed trade agreements are not acceptable. We still must review the uncommitted territories as well as discuss the schedule for exchange of technology. Good. Tomorrow, then. Such a sentimental people, these Kriosians. It's hard to believe we have a common ancestry. I suppose they've sent the metamorph. I'm sure she'll be satisfactory. Between you and me, Captain, I am far more interested in the trade agreements.
