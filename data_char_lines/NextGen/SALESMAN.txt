Beautiful, isn't it? It's the centrepiece of the whole unit. Why, the Echo Papa Six Oh Seven. Our proudest achievement. The ultimate in weapons system technology. Impressive demonstration, isn't it? Versatile, powerful, and easy to use. The Six Oh Seven does it all. Its various modules can gather information, neutralise ground personnel, even destroy enemy space vessels. Of course I can tell you. I am programmed to answer any and all questions about the unit. I can talk terms, arrange for delivery, whatever you need. The Six Oh Seven represents the state of the art in dynamic, adaptive design. It learns from each encounter, and improves itself. Once unleashed, the unit is invincible. The perfect killing system. The unit has analysed its last attack and constructed a new, stronger, deadlier weapon. In a moment, it will launch that weapon against the targets on the surface. Why would I want to do that? It can't demonstrate its abilities unless we let it leave the nest. [Planet surface] You've got it. Absolutely. It wouldn't be much good without it. Watch now. This is the fourth and final projectile. The Echo Papa series Six Oh Seven is about to complete this phase of its mission. [Planet Surface] Why? You haven't seen half of what this beauty can do. Does that mean you're going to buy it? You won't be sorry. Done. (The salesman disappears, and so does the 'projectile') [Planet Surface] (Tasha's mouth is wide open)
