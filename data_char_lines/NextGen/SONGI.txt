Please. Does anyone read us? Captain, I am Chairman Songi of Gamelan Four. An unidentified spacecraft has entered orbit above our planet. Radiation levels in our atmosphere have increased by three thousand percent. We can only assume we are under attack, but the ship will not answer our hails. We are a peaceful planet. We have no ability to defend ourselves. Please, can you help us? Thank you, Captain. Yes, Commander. Not yet, but some areas are already detecting dangerous levels. Thank you, Commander.
