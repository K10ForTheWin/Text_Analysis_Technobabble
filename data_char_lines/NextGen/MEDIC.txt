He's checking out fine, Doctor.
Doctor Pulaski. I've got a problem here. The knitter isn't working. Doctor?
Right away, sir. [Pakled armoury]
On our way, Commander.
Yes, Doctor. (the medic leaves. Beverly starts scanning a woman, then hears a rustling behind her. She goes to another, and hears something again. She looks behind her, and all the bodies are sitting upright in their shrouds. She closes her eyes)
Yes, Doctor. 
Yes, Doctor.
Yes, Doctor.
Doctor Crusher? You'd better take a look at this.
Sickbay to Doctor Crusher. You wanted to be told when the cultures were ready.
Aye, sir.
Yes, Doctor. Let's go, let's go. Get him on here.
Yes, Doctor. (this dialogue gets very faint as we concentrate on Riker and the eyes of the injured man) Yes, Doctor.
We're on our way. [Observation lounge]
