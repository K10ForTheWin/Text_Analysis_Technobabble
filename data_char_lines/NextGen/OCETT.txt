We were merely scouting the planet for possible colonization What were you doing here, then? Ha! Yes. And I will fire on anyone who attempts to obtain another one. What is that supposed to mean? Typical Klingon thinking. Take what you want and destroy the rest. A weapon? The Yridian who sold us the information claimed that the programme would yield the key to an unlimited power source. He's right. As far as we know, it might just be a recipe for biscuits. How dare you! What do you propose? You are remarkably short sighted, Nu'Daq. We are closer to the answer than we were. Perhaps we could exchange insults some other time. I'm rather busy now. I shall destroy the entire rockface and every trace of DNA with it. You will go back to Romulus empty-handed. Your superiors will be quite pleased. How can I be sure you won't kill me if I acquiesce. The very notion. That a Cardassian could have anything in common with a Klingon, it turns my stomach.
