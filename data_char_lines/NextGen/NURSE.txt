Deactivating neural callipers. (Picard wakes up as the rest of the team leave)
Normal. One thirty seven.
Yes, Doctor. We've got incorporation, Doctor. Brain waves are still irregular. Here we go. EEG approaching regular.
Doctor! I think you'd better come and look at this. The Klingon's condition is worsening.
Right away. [Observation lounge]
Should we get a stasis unit?
Oh, you'll wear yourself out with all that pacing, Milady. My poor lamb. You've got a brain sickness for sure. Can't I get you something to ease your suffering? Well, I wasn't thinking of spirits, Milady, but I have some nice fresh leeches. To drain the fever. Oh, her mind's in an awful turmoil, Sir Guy. Milady, everyone in Nottingham knows, Sir Guy of Gisbourne. You sent for me, Milady? You want me to go to Sherwood Forest at this time of night? But it's dark. I'll get lost. Besides, it's not safe. What with all them hedge robbers and worse lurking about. If you ask me, you'd be better off with Sir Guy. He's got a future. Why, you'll be living in London afore you know it.
Neural stimulator locked in. Affirmative. She's not responding, Doctor. Her synaptic network is breaking down. Neurons are beginning to depolarise. Direct?
Yes, Doctor.
Watch the door. Careful, he may have suffered cranial damage. Right. Right, here we go. (the patient is lifted onto a bed) All right. Careful. (the patient is hooked up to monitors) They're fluctuating, sir. From another planet, hundreds of them. Hold it.
Doctor Crusher, please report to Sickbay. Yes, Doctor. Her contractions are now one minute apart.
Lay down carefully. There you go. Are you ready to sit up?
Doctor Crusher. (Hands over a PADD with his examination results) Yes, Doctor.
