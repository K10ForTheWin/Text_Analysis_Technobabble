(human man) We're going to need two more conduits. Where's the ODN interface? [Arkaria base] (the reception includes a buffet table and waiters serving drinks. Data is prowling, observing a shorter, balding man in action) Okay. That should do it. I think. Yes. Yes, that does it. All right. Transfer five hundred milligrams from the reserve system to the engine core. (Satler does it) Perfect. Don't worry, I've got it. I'll be right there. (Picard does something to the inducer then dashes out of Engineering as the blast door comes down. He climbs the ladder of a Jefferies tube. Satler chases him. Picard opens a bulkhead to see the baryon sweep heading towards them. A few minutes later, Satler comes to the same bulkhead, now shut. Picard's jacket is on the deckplate. He lifts it to see an open panel, then the sweep comes through the bulkhead.) [Corridor] (Satler's death scream reaches Picard as he walks along) [Engineering] The primary inducer is completely fused. There's no way to fix it. Without the diverter, we don't have any protection from the baryon sweep. About twelve minutes. We should go to Ten Forward. That's the last place on the ship that'll be swept by the baryon field. What? Do you know how volatile trilithium is? We can't just start hauling it through the ship. (Kelsey gives him a Look) I'll, I'll try to make some modifications. There. Three hundred milligrams of trilithium. I'm using a dynamic stabiliser to act as a control rod. There. That should keep the resin stable enough for transport. What's wrong? How much farther do we have to go? No. Just remove the control rod, drain the unit. There shouldn't be any problem.
