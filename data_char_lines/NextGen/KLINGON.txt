Look. Priority message to you from the home planet. It seems Ambassador K'Ehleyr is looking into things she should not be. Yes, sir. (And simply walks out of the room into the corridor) He has claimed the right of vengeance.
This is the Klingon vessel Maht-H'a. What are you doing here? Captain's log, supplemental. It seems that we have not one, but two competitors in our attempt to complete Professor Galen's puzzle. I have prevailed upon the Cardassian and Klingon captains to meet with me. [Observation lounge] Minor damage to starboard nacelle. We will be operational in less than one hour.
Aft shields down. Port shields are still down. They were able to raise the shields in time. Minor damage only. (the ship fires on the Bortas) Shields failing! (another Klingon ship swoops in and drives off their attacker)
Federation ship Enterprise. Surrender and prepare to be boarded.
We are Klingons. Kahless! Kahless. (Kahless walks straight to his throne and sits)
MeH HoD. MeHmaH ghoS.
