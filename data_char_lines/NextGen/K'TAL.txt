naDev ghoS! (Picard walks forward) Have you reached a decision regarding the succession of power? Gowron, son of M'Rel, hakt'em. The Arbiter confirms that you have completed the Rite of Succession. Your enemies have been destroyed. You stand alone. Do you wish to claim leadership of the Council? Are there no other challengers? (just as Picard is about to put the cloak on Gowron's shoulders) Who are you? Lursa, B'Etor, come forward. The Arbiter will consider his validity. Len'mat. [Duras home] (the sisters have Romulan visitors) What is your decision? Receive now the loyalty of the Council and of the Empire.
