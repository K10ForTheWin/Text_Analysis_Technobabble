Hill? The name is Slade Bender. It's about Alva. Okay, you want to play stupid? That's jake with me. A week ago a man came in here. He wanted you to find his girlfriend. Name's Alva. You know, you're getting on my nerves. You found her, all right. Face down in the river. Yeah, yeah, we're all broken up about it. Especially the boyfriend, who's been indicted for murder. Nah, I'm here to kill you! You're through ducking me, Hill!
