Well, hello. Join us. Watch! I bet you can't do this! (He walks along in a hand-stand.) No! It's forbidden to disturb new plants! (But Wesley jumps to catch the ball, and clears the fence, smashing into the cold frame) Couldn't you see the fence? It's for new plants. Don't ever go past a white marker. But he doesn't understand. But it was my fault. I threw the ball past him.
Bye.
Come on, Toq. (Toq rolls a hoop and knocks the staves off) Who's next? Okay? Try again. (Worf walks over and pulls an upright out of the ground. As Toq rolls the hoop, Worf throws the stave through it.)
