Welcome, gentlemen. Have a nice trip? We've been expecting you. A trio of foreign gentlemen. Of course you are. Welcome to the Hotel Royale I'm busy. No, and for your own good you'd better quit thinking about Rita. Then you're a fool. Anybody with any sense is afraid of Mickey D. Kid's just asking for trouble. Rita's too much for him to handle, and Mickey D's going to plant his face in the pavement. Now, here are your room keys. And some complimentary casino chips. Enjoy. Why, this is the Royale, of course. And my personal life is really none of your business, thank you. I beg your pardon? Earth. What do you call it? How charming. (The manager returns to putting mail into pigeon holes, so the team take a stroll amongst the tables) Are you crazy? You think you're going to scare Mickey D with that gun? Kid, she's a big girl, and she's Mickey D's girl. Look, kid. I like you. I don't want to see you get hurt, especially over some dame I'm sure the concierge will be delighted The Royale's exits are clearly marked. If you have a complaint about the service you've received during your stay here, you can always take it up with the manager. I'm afraid the manager is very busy. (The desk clerk leaves) Rita just called. It was kind of hard to tell. She was crying. Okay, boys. Look, we can't afford to have any trouble in here. Why don't you just take this outside. Just watch yourself. You're very kind, sir. The man has the touch. I'm afraid you've broken the bank. You're the foreign investors.
