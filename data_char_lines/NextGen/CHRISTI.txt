Hi, Geordi. So, how have you been? How are things down in Engineering? Well, I'll see you around. (She leaves him, and he puts his head on the bar) I was just on my way down to the arboretum. I'd love some, but I didn't think you were interested in that kind of thing. Well, this is where I get off. See you tonight in Ten Forward? Hello, Commander.
