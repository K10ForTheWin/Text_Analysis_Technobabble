There are guards out there. You'll never escape that way. I'm not afraid of you. We shouldn't fear the unknown. We should embrace it. Are you really an alien? It's all right to tell me. I don't believe you. You are an alien. I could divert the guard's attention. You might stand a chance if you took the service exit down the hallway to the right. Why should I? I believe you. If you make love to me. I've always wanted to make love with an alien. Lanel. Oh, it's not so much to ask, and then I'll help you escape. I can't wait to learn. (she takes of her spectacles) It's your only way out of here, my alien. [Medical Facility Corridor] (an undetermined length of time later) Something's happened to him. I think he's dead. Go on, get some help. (the guard runs off, and she beckons Riker out of the room) Okay. No, that way. Will I ever see you again?
