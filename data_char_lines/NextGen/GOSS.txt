I've learned from informed sources that the Federation has manipulated these negotiations from the very beginning, and has already signed a secret agreement with the Barzans. The Ferengi offer was never seriously considered. If the Ferengi cannot have the wormhole, no one will. Casualties of war, Commander. My men are prepared to die. Are yours? I have nothing to say to you, Ral. I have your word on this? This is an acceptable offer. But I was tense! I was ready to blow it up! I strongly protest!
