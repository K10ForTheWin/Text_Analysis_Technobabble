On behalf of all Ferengi, I protest. Why were we not invited to these negotiations? My name is DaiMon Goss. These are my consuls, Kol and Doctor Arridor. We'll need chairs. Good, then see to it that we get chairs. Fine, fine, just have your Klingon servant get us some chairs. Then who gets the chairs? Very well. Kol, the bag. We can handle all the pleasantries later. Now, let's get down to business. (He opens the bag of gold-pressed latinum bars) I'll match anyone's best offer, and add the gold on top of it. [Troi's office] Doctor, you surprise me. I have no wish to kill anyone. A short term crippling will suffice. I'd say it is time to extend the hand of the Ferengi to the representative of the Federation. [Troi's quarters] (Troi opens the door to Ral, wearing an off the shoulder blue dress) You attempt to gain every unfair advantage, Picard. Well, I most certainly do. First, you conveniently arrange to play host, then you plan to send your own manned probe into the wormhole. The Federation thinks it can do anything it wants to. Well, I will not tolerate it! And you expect us to believe what you report? That's exactly what I intend to do. And I should strongly suggest you stay out of our way. (The Ferengi's leave) I've learned from informed sources that the Federation has manipulated these negotiations from the very beginning, and has already signed a secret agreement with the Barzans. The Ferengi offer was never seriously considered. [on viewscreen] We will be ignored no longer. If the Ferengi cannot have the wormhole, no one will. Casualties of war, Commander. My men are prepared to die. Are yours? I have nothing to say to you, Ral. I have your word on this? This is an acceptable offer. But I was tense! I was ready to blow it up! I strongly protest!
