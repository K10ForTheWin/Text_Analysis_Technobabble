We'll see to that. A pleasure to see you again, Counsellor Troi. My good friend, Ral, is the best hired gun in the business. Is it always on time, Bhavani? I don't think the Ferengi are the greatest threat at the table. With all of DaiMon Goss' bluster, they don't have the resources the Barzans need. An accurate observation. How did you recognise that? You must play poker, Commander. Our skills are not dissimilar, Commander. Are you saying this may not be what it seems? And of course that means, once the contract is negotiated and closed, we would be obliged to fulfill the terms. I don't think Bhavani could object to that. I seem to be a bit warm. (he collapses)
