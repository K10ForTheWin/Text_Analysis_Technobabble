Gul Dolak, Cardassian Militia Four One. We have no argument with you, Captain. No more than we value the relations with our Federation neighbours. We have identified the Bajoran ship you are escorting as a terrorist carrier. Most certain, Captain. It has committed many crimes against us. We know its markings well. We would request that you withdraw and leave the matter to us. Nor do you. We intend to destroy it. You are protecting the enemies of the Cardassian people. If you do not withdraw, we will take great offence. We are prepared to take any steps necessary. It is a complaint from your Cardassian neighbours. You have one hour to withdraw. (transmission ends)
