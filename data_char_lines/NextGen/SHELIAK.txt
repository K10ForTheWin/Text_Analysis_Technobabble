Conversation is neither required nor desired. Our involvement in Federation illegality is not indicated. Remove the humans from the Tau Cygna system. Three Earth days remain. Negotiate to what purpose? The treaty is signed. Denied. The law is paramount. We are entitled. Your purpose, Enterprise? Meaningless. Granted. (Transmission ends) You have the right. Grisellas? Absurd. We carry the membership. We can brook no delay. Wait! Negotiation is permiss (Picard has him cut off in mid word) You may have your three weeks, Picard of the Enterprise.
