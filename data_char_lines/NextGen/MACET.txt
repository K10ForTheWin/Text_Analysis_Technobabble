I am Gul Macet of the Cardassian ship Trager. A curious question, Captain. In war, one attacks one's enemies. Perhaps that fact was unknown to the Federation starship which destroyed our space station in the Cuellar System two days ago. Attacked an unarmed science station. They had barely enough time to send an emergency signal before they were incinerated. We are not the ones who abandoned it, Captain. Very well. One hour. (note - you may thing you know what a Cardassian looks like. You're not entirely correct, yet. This version has a bit of facial hair, a weird headpiece that comes down to the nose and less neck, but is still played by Marc Alaimo) [Ready room]
