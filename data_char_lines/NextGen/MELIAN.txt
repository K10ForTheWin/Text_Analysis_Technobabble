(an old man) I am honoured. Music speaks its own language. I know we'll have much to learn from each other. Don't worry, Katie, you'll be seeing Wesley soon. (Katie and Melian leave) Now, hold it a little bit more firmly. That's it. Perfect. Now think. No, think's not right. Feel the notes inside your head. (She closes her eyes, and the machine lights up with a loud chord. She drops it) No, it's all right. You can't break this. Yes, it's a direct expression of the music within. Now we just have to teach you to structure that feeling. Try it again. (She produces a melancholy little tune) That was beautiful. Now, play something happier.
