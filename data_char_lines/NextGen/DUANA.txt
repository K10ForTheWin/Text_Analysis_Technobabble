Custodian, Wesley Crusher's voice will be entered into the authorised file for Third Level clearance. Announce yourself to the Custodian. It frees us from all burden. It takes care of all our needs. It regulates our lives. The Progenitors. Oh, hundreds of centuries ago. Wesley, why is that important? It does what we ask it. It always has. What difference does it make how it works? Why would we want to repair it? Wesley, Radue is right. You ask questions I can't answer. Ask the Custodian instead. He already is. He was just never encouraged properly. The tool Leda is giving him will allow him to bring out his visions. Oh, no. It will happen quite quickly. Stop, Custodian. We must work now. There is much to learn. (Wesley looks at the door with the symbol on it) I don't know. It's forbidden. Captain's log, supplemental. We remain in orbit around Aldea. It's becoming all too evident that talk will not effect the return of our children. We must neutralise the Aldean shield. Until then, we are helpless. [Bridge] You haven't eaten. I know you miss your family. But you will grow accustomed to us. I promise you'll be happy. We are offering more, especially for you.
