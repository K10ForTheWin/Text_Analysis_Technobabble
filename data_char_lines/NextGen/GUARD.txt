This is Ramos. The forcefield in Security Three has been broken. (He tries to go in, and gets shot) (Another guard dodges Konmel's shots and gets him, although it takes three blasts to put him down. Korris uses Ramos's phaser to kill the guard)
Ensign Crusher, what can I do for you? Is there a problem?
They're at level two. Come on. Spread out. (Riker and Worf take out the remaining two guards, then Geordi gets to work) [Tunnel] Let's check five. Watch your backs.
Sir. Excuse me, sir. You cannot leave your quarters without an escort. (and Duras slips out in the other direction) [K'Ehleyr's quarters]
