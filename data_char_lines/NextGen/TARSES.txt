Simon Tarses, Crewman First Class, medical technician. No, sir. I have nothing to hide. Since Stardate 43587. That's right. Largely. My paternal grandfather was Vulcan. Er, he, I mean, there's no relationship. He just came in for his injections. Sometimes. There were several of us. Actually, I might have done it twice. Not really. He hardly ever talked. Once or twice in Ten Forward, with a group of people, but I never had a conversation with him. Thank you, sir, but I don't need protection. I have not done anything wrong. It's part of my job, yes. Several technicians share that job. Because I have access does not mean I I had nothing to do with that. What? On the advice of my counsel I refuse to answer that question, in that the answer may serve to incriminate me. [Observation lounge] No, thank you, sir. This is fine. Yes, sir. All my life I wanted to be in Starfleet. I went to the Academy's training programme for enlisted personnel. I took training as a medical technician and I served at several outposts. The day that I was posted to the Enterprise was the happiest day of my life. My parents wanted me to. And then I thought about it. I used to sit under this big tree near the parade grounds Yes, that's the one. I used to sit under that tree and watch the drills, picture myself an officer. I know that it would have made my mother very happy, but. No. I was eighteen, and eager. The last thing I wanted to do was spend four years sitting in classrooms. I wanted to be out there, travelling the stars. I didn't want to wait for anything. And now it's done, isn't it? My career in Starfleet is finished. It doesn't matter. I lied on my application, and that mistake will be with me for the rest of my life. [Corridor] (Norah is giving instructions to her silent aide, Nellen)
