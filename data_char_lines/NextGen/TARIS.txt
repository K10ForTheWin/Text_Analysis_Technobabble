Captain Picard. Explain yours. No. But believe me, Captain, had we chosen to exercise our right to defend the Neutral Zone, we would not have stopped with one starship. You will leave at once. This is Sub-Commander Taris of the Haakona. Why have you penetrated deeper into the Neutral Zone? I have claimed this planet for the Romulan Empire. You will withdraw or I will be forced to destroy your ship and your away team. (Transmission ends, the Romulan ship starts to cloak then decloaks again) (through static) This is your final warning, I will not (The picture clears up, but something else is going on off screen) You're stalling for time. What? Go to your stations. You did this. You sabotaged my ship. I cannot deactivate the auto-destruct, but at least I have the satisfaction that you will die with us. (As he is beamed away) Agreed, Enterprise. Standing by.
