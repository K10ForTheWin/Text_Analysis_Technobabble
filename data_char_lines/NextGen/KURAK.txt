But only if it works. I'm not convinced that this metaphasic shield can withstand either the temperature or the radiation it would be exposed to. For which, of course, we have only your word. You would not be the first scientist to manipulate experimental data to his own advantage. I for one would feel more comfortable if someone else flew the shuttle. Someone more objective. I do not share your optimism, Doctor Jo'Bril, but if you wish to pilot the craft, I would be more confident in your assessment of the shield than Doctor Reyga's. Whom do you propose we sacrifice next? Yes. Personal research. No one has denied there is potential in the idea. Are you accusing me of something? I warned Doctor Reyga that if he persisted with his slander, he would pay the price. I will not repeat his lies. Be careful, Doctor. Insulting the honour of a Klingon can be extremely dangerous. I have heard enough accusations! Now I will have your silence. Sabotage. How would I know? No. I did not. Goodbye, Doctor.
