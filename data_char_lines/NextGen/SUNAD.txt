I am Commander Sunad of Zalkon. You are trespassing into our space and you are holding a Zalkonian citizen. You will return him to us immediately. Then you aided a criminal. He is one of four escaped prisoners. We eliminated the other three. We thought this one dead as well. Return him so we may complete our task. He is a disruptive influence. He spreads lies. He encourages dissent. He disturbs the natural order of our society. It is not your concern. I will give you two hours to comply. (transmission ends) Picard, we will not tolerate more delays. We do not want relations with you. We simply want you to leave Zalkonian space as soon as you return the criminal. As I said. it is not your concern. There is no defence. Our judgment is final. What kind of abilities? Lies. Obviously he has corrupted you as well. I see I am wasting my time. (all over the ship, people find they cannot breathe) [Sickbay] Ready all weapons. Fire upon that ship. (John transports Sunad to the Enterprise) Kill him, Captain. He's evil. They don't know how dangerous you are, you and the others like you. We were protecting our society. Don't touch me!
