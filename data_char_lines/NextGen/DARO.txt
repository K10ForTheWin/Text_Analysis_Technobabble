Deck ten. Your Captain is most impressive. Chief O'Brien, our Transporting system is still operating with active feed pattern buffers. I would like to talk with you about your technology. I understand. In the meantime, we're going to your Ten Forward. Will you join us? Kanar. Do you want another? And an ale. It takes a bit of getting used to. I think This has been hard on all of us. I know I'll be happy when I'm back on my own ship. That was a terrible mistake. We were told the outpost was a launching place for a massive attack against us.
