(the tall one) The next seven days should prove most illuminating. (walks up to Worf) I want this one. I'm sure, I'm sure. But I have decided. I want this Lieutenant Worf. Yes, yes. Enough of that. Show me to my quarters. This is unacceptable. Bring me new food. I require a higher protein and enzymatic content. Yes. Bring me new food. What is the mass flow rate of the antimatter replenishment stream to the containment pods? The antimatter replenishment rate. What is it? Perhaps there is someone here who does know the answer. You. Are you smarter than this one? Never mind. I wish to see the Bussard collectors. Take me to them. You are (thinks) bluffing. (Byleth takes some chips from Worf's pile and throws them into the pot) You are in error. Those chips are mine. You would dare to accuse me of stealing? You are lying because you are losing the game. (standing) Even if I were cheating, how would a plodding animal like you know it? Do not let my title inhibit you, Klingon! (Byleth prods Worf in the chest, so Worf grabs his arm and throws him across the room) Yes. Good. (Byleth kicks Worf in the chest and they get into a proper fight. Loquel keeps eating, unconcerned. Worf head-butts Byleth and Riker grabs him) Wonderful. Very good! Thank you. Lieutenant Worf. I think I understand now. That was a very effective demonstration. If you'll excuse me, I would like to document this experience. [Freighter] Lieutenant Worf was kind enough to engage me in eleven hours of holodeck battle exercises. Yes, I learned a great deal about the concept of antagonism. Indeed. (Voval and Picard come out of the shuttle)
