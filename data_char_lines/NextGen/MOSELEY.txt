We've spend years, decades, trying to avoid anything that would lead to a greenhouse effect and now here we are about to create one on purpose. What now? We'd better get started before there's nothing left to mend. [Ten Forward] (Rasmussen walks in and goes to the bar) Let's hope all goes well. Surface wind patterns over the target are stable. All thermal monitoring stations are reporting no further temperature drops. Thank you. Thank you all. You've given us what we need. Time. [Bridge] We're fairly well quake-proof down here, Picard. It's the volcanic dust I'm worried about. No amount of CO2 will help us then. We've got particulate levels right where they're supposed to be and the sun is shining! I'm getting in the habit of thanking you, Picard. (transmission ends)
