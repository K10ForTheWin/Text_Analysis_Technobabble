Be you barbarians? Speak! (The Ferengi clutch their heads in pain) Who meets the challenge? Who will it be? You have awakened Portal six three. Do you petition to enter the Empire? A guardian of the Tkon Empire. (The energy turns into a humanoid figure in a long hooded cloak, leaning on a staff) Biped. Excellent. Why do you attempt deception? The Empire is forever. We are forever. There has never been an Age of Makto. This is the Age of Bastu! Enough! Absurdities! Speak. You are accused of deceit and treachery. Do you give yourself up for judgement? Barbarian! Barbarians all! But this one first, in the fashion the Empire has always challenged savages. You have a single chance for life. One only. What is the answer to my challenge? I offer a thought. He will triumph who knows when to fight and when not to fight. You are being tested, Riker! What is the answer? Ahhh. You are facing fate with composure. But what is the answer to my challenge? Unlike these little ones who close their minds, your mind holds interesting thoughts. Know your enemy and know yourself, and you will always be victorious. Why that thought? And who is this Sun Tzu you revere? You must tell me more of this wisdom, so much like our own. It is released. All power is restored. [Bridge] (The ship whirrs back into life, and people start to open their eyes) I admit I had my doubts as your ships battled each other in overt acts of belligerence. Normally, I would have destroyed all of you and your ships, but something confused me. First, you wanted to murder each other. Then you were willing to help each other. What of them? Shall I destroy them? A most interesting conclusion. But what if they will never learn, Riker? In life, one is always tested. And learn ways to destroy you. The universe exists to me to create life. I shall sleep, until needed again. (He walks away, becomes more stooped, then vanishes) [Bridge]
