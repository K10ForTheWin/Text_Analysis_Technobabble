We were wondering the same thing about you, Captain. Why would Starfleet's flagship want to venture so close to the Cardassian border? I see. May we offer our assistance? If you don't mind my asking, what exactly is this telescope of yours designed to do? I'm certain it would never be used to observe a neighbouring species. Well then, best of luck with your repairs. Just try to make certain that your studies are limited to astronomical phenomena. (transmission ends)
