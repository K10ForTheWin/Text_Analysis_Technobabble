Well, it's about time. Couldn't get away from the Bridge? I'm glad, Mark. Do you want me to help you up? (The front of the wheelchair opens, and he eases himself out and into a nearby chair) You're stronger today. This ship is magnificent. It even has family quarters. Pity we didn't have them twenty, thirty years ago. We could have been together almost all of your career. Mark! (he's in pain) Mark? I'll get Sickbay. When? You haven't said anything. What is it? Do the doctors know? You're sure? Don't lie to me. I don't know how much more information you think you can get from that tape. (Jameson stands up) Mark! My God, what's happened? Oh, darling! (She kisses him, but when he responds amorously) Mark? You really are looking much better. No. Come here. You stop it. (She brings him to a mirror and puts the light on) Darling, you look like you looked twenty years ago. Now you tell me what the hell is going on? Sickbay! Medical emergency in the Admiral's quarters! [Crusher's office] Captain. What did you do, Mark? It would matter to me. Why didn't you tell me, Mark? We've always been honest with each other, until now. Oh, I'm sure you believed that, until you had a chance to head up a mission, to command again, and then you just upended the bottle or whatever it was, and damn everything. Did you think about me at all? But you never asked if I wanted it. It's just like you, Mark, to assume that what you felt was right was the only answer. Let me go! Our anniversary is next week. Our fiftieth. But he's getting younger, and I'm, well look at me. Why did he do this? What about our lives, his and mine? I was looking forward to time together finally. Our retirement. Now he's young again, and has his life to live over. Know what? What is it? Mark, can you hear me? I'll always love you. Flatterer. It's grey now.
