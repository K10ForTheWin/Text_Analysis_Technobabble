Our gravitational field has been affected. Seismic activity has increased by a factor of three. If it works, the core would remain molten for centuries. Very well. But before we proceed, I'd like to update our geological surveys. Thank you, Captain. (Pran, Picard and La Forge leave) Someone's checked his calculations, of course. Even so, he is a machine. Someone should check up on him. Commander, may I suggest we set up the infusion unit in the first magma pocket and give this one a chance to cool. There are signs of stress in the surrounding magma, but the site should remain stable until we finish the plasma infusion. Data, Juliana told me what she said to you last night. She's been very upset. I don't blame you for being angry with her We were running a final check on the infusion units when a part of the wall gave way. She's right, we have to act now.
