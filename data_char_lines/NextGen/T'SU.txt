Commander Riker, this is Ensign T'Su. [Ruins] I'm monitoring a slight energy buildup near your position. I am not able to pinpoint the source. East of your position, ten metres. I will continue monitoring. [Jungle] Sensors indicate low level energy readings, but the only life signs are the away team. Previous energy readings are gone. Sir, I'm reading life forms on the planet. All five members of the away team. Picking up an object to starboard, sir, heading toward us. Starboard shields weakened. I can't seem to pin down the pattern. Sorry, sir, I should have seen that. Number four shield buckling. Number three shield nearing failure. Backup systems are overloaded. Backup systems failing. All decks report ready. Shields and deflectors are up. Hull temperature one thousand degrees and rising. Hull temperature twenty five hundred degrees. Hull three thousand degrees. Thirty three hundred degrees. Turbulence to starboard! Scanners locked. Locked onto away team. Beaming them home now. Sickbay reports Doctor Crusher's going to be fine.
