You say she had dark hair? She was here. You just missed her. No. (Worf and Data leave, and Ro stops kissing the man. He's disappointed.) So, did you kill that Cardassian? There are worse things a person can do than kill a Cardassian soldier. In the Zone, there are a lot of us who feel that way. What is your name? We're the people who saved you from Starfleet. Did you kill that Cardassian? Where are you living now? When were you on Jaros? What were you doing on Omara? Macias. I've checked with my sources at Starfleet. Her story's true. Then we have to make a preemptive strike. Send a message to the Cardassians that we won't sit still while they kill us with toxins. You're wanted by Starfleet. They're not going to give you medkits just because you ask for them. It's madness. You took your ship through their shields? I have to inventory supplies and find out what we have. Why is that a concern? But it's too big for us to go after alone. Ro! (she takes one, and others get handed out. Santos kills one Cardassian, Kalita another, then Macias goes to help a wounded man and gets shot himself. Ro kills the last Cardassian) Squad leader to all ships. We'll be crossing the border in less than one minute. Arm your weapons. Ro, why are you firing? I see it! Squad leader to all ships. Abort the mission. Repeat, abort the mission. [Bridge]
