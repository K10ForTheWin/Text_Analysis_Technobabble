Mordock. No. Only a hopeful, like you. (An officer enters) I must admit, Wesley, you have a very fast mind. Yes, there is only one ratio with matter antimatter. One to one. Is that good, Wesley? A very strange reaction. Was this incident deliberate? Then it was a test. Zaldans have webbed fingers? I wouldn't have passed. [Observation Lounge] I can't get it. No, it's going too fast. Wesley, I can't do it. (Wesley turns from his own screen to look at Mordock's) No, it should not have been that way. Mister Crusher helped me. I will be. Thank you, sir, but it's not right. It shouldn't be me. Wesley lost points because he helped me. He should not be punished for his generosity. I am sorry, Wesley. Yes. I believe I would.
