Barron to Enterprise. Our temporary repairs have failed. The reactor is now inoperative. Three hours at best. Wait. No! No! We must evacuate. The others? And Palmer? Where is Palmer? Picard, you have to find him. He may be hurt. Thank you, Picard. Picard, you must beam Palmer aboard immediately. Without medical attention It will slightly increase the cultural contamination which already exists. A small price for saving Palmer's life. Picard, I must protest. You're endangering Palmer with this delay. They are not normally a violent people but these are extraordinary circumstances. They're trying to comprehend what they believe to be a god. The Mintakans wish to please the Overseer, but they can only guess what he wants. They need a sign. You must go down to Mintaka Three. Has already been violated. The damage is done. All we can do now is minimise it. By giving them guidelines. Letting them know what the Overseer expects of them. Like it or not, we have rekindled the Mintakans' belief in the Overseer. It's inevitable. And without guidance, that religion could degenerate into inquisitions, holy wars, chaos. And how do you propose to convince her? I'm here, Mary. (Picard and Nuria enter)
