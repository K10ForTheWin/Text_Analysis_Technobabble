You know, I've never even been away from home. Now I'm going all the way to Vertiform City! Hey, if you're the Engineer, who's doing the drivin'? (a gangster shoots the Engineer in the back) Not yet, but we're gettin' close. What do you think we're making? A puzzle! Well, I don't know. (Troi goes to the card game) Excuse me. Are we going to get there okay? Well, they got this restaurant there where you can eat all you want, any time. It's the best food around. [Holodeck - Engine room] (coal fired of course, like the TOS blooper) Whoo wee, that was a close one, wasn't it? Well, New Vertiform City, of course. Sorry, folks, but you ain't going nowhere. [Bridge] Well, I don't know. You're really going to help get us to New Vertiform City? Okay. But just one of you. The rest stay here. [Holodeck - Engine room]
