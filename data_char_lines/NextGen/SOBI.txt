(the smart man) Careful with your choice of words, T'Jon. It's ours, not yours. Then where are they? Tell me. Hence the deal was incomplete. Hence possession of the felicium remains ours. Commander, I request you transport my associate and myself down to Brekka, with our merchandise. Langor, you expect too much from them. You always have, and you've always been disappointed. You didn't pay for it, therefore it's not yours. What can you offer? Then it's going to be difficult to accommodate you. [Bridge] Our cargo, Captain. Yes. It must be painstakingly cultivated, harvested, purified. A complex and expensive process. I am constrained to abide by the terms of our agreement. You find us well, I trust? Our medicine. Of course. You are right, Doctor. Could we leave now? May I say, Captain, how impressed we are with your ship and all its facilities. We cannot agree That is not surprising. Captain, we Brekkians are in business. We are not in the habit of giving away what has not been paid for. No charge. This measures the individual portions. (He takes a few grains and puts them into the device) We've improved our distillation process over the years. But now with our improved processes, this one barrel contains over four billion doses. But never more than seventy two hours. But felicium inhibits the sickness with total efficiency. We've therefore concentrated on treatment, finding new ways to improve the potency and purity of felicium. We have no other industry. But one we'd be fools not to take advantage of. It's mutually beneficial. We both of us feel deeply about what is happening on Ornara. They can pay whenever they are able. What are you going to do? But you are talking to us about it. We'll discuss the payment terms later. May we beam down with you and discuss it? If you withhold those coils, you'll be disrupting the stability of both our planets. That's absurd!
