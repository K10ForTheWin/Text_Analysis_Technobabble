Sorry to sneak up on you like that, Jean Luc Out here, you never know who's listening. Keeps you on your toes, anyway. Hey, Will. Will, you getting soft on that luxury liner? Well, you know, they send you Galaxy Class boys out here to the far reaches. Me, I'm just hauling my butt back and forth between starbases. No, not today. Starfleet's got new orders for you. This is top priority. They need the fastest ship in the fleet and the best people. That is you. They're worried about Romulan eavesdropping on this one. And we've got a passenger for you. Hard to send by subspace. Mission specialist. He'll bring your orders aboard with him. His name is Tam Elbrun. The same. What can I say? Your orders are to cooperate fully with him. Best of luck, folks. Hood out.
