Come on, Toots, let's go. [Interrogation room]
Next man.
Stand aside, stand aside. Let me in here. People said there was gunfire in here. What's going on? I haven't seen you before. I worked downtown for three years. I don't remember you. No, wait. Wait. I'm going to ask all of you to come down to the station for questioning. Including you. Where'd you get that? That's a gentleman's cane. Never seen a cane like this before. I'll have to confiscate it for evidence. Now, be sure you put in the part about me spotting that phony policeman.
