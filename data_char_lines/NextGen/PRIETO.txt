What a jolt! Sir, I have an onboard systems failure. You'll have to tell me where I am. I can't confirm. My instruments are haywire. Yes, sir. Just a little shaken. We're being buffeted a bit. Losing more power! My flight control computer's fried. I can see it. Captain, we're out of control. We're caught in the planet's gravity. Captain's log, supplemental. We've lost all contact with shuttlecraft thirteen, and can only assume they've crash-landed on Vagra Two. Meanwhile, main Engineering is trying to return us to warp power. [Engineering]
