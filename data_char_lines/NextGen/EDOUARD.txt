Monsieur, welcome to the Cafe des Artistes. Is this your first time in Paris? This way. Mais oui, bien sur, monsieur. We are here to please you. (Picard gazes from the balcony towards le Tour d'Eiffel, and the otherwise future city-scape) Some wine, some cheese? Perhaps what you hunger for is not on the menu. Your young lady, she did not come? You, however, did not. Ah. Well, trust Edouard. I will bring something very special, just for you. (Two young women are talking at the next table) Madame, this way. The Captain is waiting for you. (The wine is on ice) Bien sur. Pourquoi pas?
