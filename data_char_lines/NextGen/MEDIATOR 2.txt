Speak the truth. We are mediators. How very sad. But this zone has been selected. And if this Zone were still in effect, you would all deserve death. You are powerful, but do not do this to us, we beg you. At least study what we were without law. Hurtful to each other, savage, thieving. No, it is God who will punish you. We cannot allow ignorance of the law to become a defence.
