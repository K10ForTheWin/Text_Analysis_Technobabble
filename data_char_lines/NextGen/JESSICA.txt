Oh well, at least you're ready for Halloween. I need your help, Mister Hill. Someone is trying to kill me. Captain's personal log. I'm delighted with how the Holodeck has created the fictional world of Dixon Hill, the twentieth century detective who has been a hero of mine since childhood. The illusion is flawless. The characters I meet are generated by the computer, of course, yet they feel real, they seem real in every way. [Hill's office] I'm not sure who wants me dead. My husband, my stepdaughter. Perhaps. Or perhaps it's Cyrus Redblock. I need you to find out. Name your fee. Agreed. Oh, you'll say yes, Mister Hill. (she kisses him) If it is Redblock, he must think I've got what he's looking for. But believe me, I don't. Here's a C-note in advance. Consider it a retainer. (she tucks it in his collar) And next time, wear a suit. Au revoir. (She takes one of his calling cards and leaves. Picard looks out of the window)
