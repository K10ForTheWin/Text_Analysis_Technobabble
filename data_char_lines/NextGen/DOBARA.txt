(or Cassidy Yates for DS9 fans)Â  It's too dangerous. The storms can occur without warning. If you're caught in one. We can't survive in here. Our supplies won't last forever. What does it mean? May I speak with you? I don't know what Nikolai said to you but, please, forgive him. I've never seen him like this. He's usually so confident, so sure of himself. But now he seems different. Do you know why? Ever since Vorin was lost, people have been afraid. Worried that we won't reach our new home. We need Nikolai's strength now more than ever. When the storms first came to our village, many of us were ready to die. But Nikolai refused to let us. He gathered us together and led us into caves. He saved us. He is a brave and compassionate man, and I love him. Please, go to him. Make things right between you. I want us to be a family. Yes. I want you to consider yourself my brother. After all, you're going to be the uncle of my child. [Bridge] What does it mean ? Nikolai, don't.
