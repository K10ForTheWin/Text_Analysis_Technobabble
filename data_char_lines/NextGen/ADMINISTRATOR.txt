There you are, Batai. Perhaps you can explain to me, when crops are dying all over, how this tree is flourishing? A good point. Perhaps I shall recommend a symbolic tree in each of my communities. Now. What business do we have today? Batai, you're being a bit of an alarmist. True, we are in a drought, but water rationing has produced a sizeable savings. Who is this? Kamin. Do I know you? Well, Kamin, I'm open to all the people of this town. I'm delighted to hear what you have to say. I don't mean to quash your very creative ideas but building atmospheric condensers would be a monumental undertaking. We could not hope to sustain such a project. Well, I'll be glad to pass along your idea. You'll see that this kind of participatory government works for everyone. Be well, Batai. I shall see you next month. Good to meet you, Kanin. Kamin, what do you hope to accomplish? Spreading rumours that the planet is doomed. There could be chaos. I won't be a party to your making trouble. Your observations, your findings, our scientists reached those same conclusions two years ago. Well, what did you expect us to do? Make it public? Can you imagine the effect? Evacuated where? Our technology is limited. We're just beginning to launch small missiles. Enough! There is a plan in work. I cannot tell you more than that.
