It is our pleasure to be here, Captain. Allow me to introduce Voval. He will be taking you back to our homeworld. Please. (Troi and Loquel leave) Are you going to eat? You have no food on your plate. Are you going to eat? Desserts? What is this? My people eat only for nourishment. That is, that is Delicious. Are you sure you don't want some of this, this papalla juice? Are you sure? It is very delicious. Please, please. You've been so kind. Please. (Troi takes the smallest possible sip) What is this? Child? Offspring. Post-cellular compounding. We emerge from the natal pod fully grown. Do you have a name? Eric. Do you like dessert? (Eric nods, so Loquel addresses his mother) May I give Eric some dessert? I will see the bet, and raise ten. Counsellor, these are bio-enzymatic supplements my people consume for food. I'm afraid you will find they are not as delicious as your chocolate. (to Byleth) Fascinating species.
