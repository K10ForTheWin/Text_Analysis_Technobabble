I killed no one! Yes. Yes, I was there. My patrol route takes me near the station every six days. Three days ago, I hailed them. There was no response. I was concerned. Yes. I went aboard to see what had happened. There was no one was there, so I left. That's all. What of it? This is outrageous! We will not tolerate these ridiculous accusations! Yes, I did take the messages. No. I killed no one. There was no one there. I took the codes, but I killed no one. What is this?
