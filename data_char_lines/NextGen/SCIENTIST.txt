Work crews were down here installing seismic regulators when they found some remarkable artefacts. Yes. (he takes a sheet off a packing case to reveal the items) Here, look inside the watch. (an engraving - To S.L.C., with love. 30 November, 1889). The crew was having a problem with the regulators. Something inside the cavern was interfering with the phase conditioners. It turned out to be the cavern itself. (Data gets out his tricorder) Which you're not going to find on Earth in either the nineteenth or twenty fourth century. We've confirmed that no one has been in or out of this cavern in centuries, so we're left with a five hundred year old mystery. As we continued our excavation, we found one other thing I haven't shown you yet. We've tried to leave everything as we found it. (and he uncovers - Data's head) Captain's log, stardate 45960.2. We have transported the materials discovered in the cavern back to the ship for analysis. I wish I could be as dispassionate about the implications as my second officer. [Engineering]
Have you been able to find any explanation for this? No, it has a ferrous crystalline structure and it will be able to withstand tidal forces, Captain That damage would be insignificant, Captain, compared to the seismic repercussions massive landquakes, and tsunami. Our population has already taken shelter, but I'm afraid no shelter will be adequate if you fail. Especially for the people on the western continent. The moon. It's back to its normal orbit. How ever you did it, thank you. (transmission ends)
