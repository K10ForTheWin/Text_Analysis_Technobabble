We are far from home. My friend. His name is Reginod. He is Reginod. Can you make our ship go? We look for things to make us go. Will our ship go now? It is broken. You want to hurt us. Make more weapons. It is not broken. You will make more. [Bridge] We want to be smart. We are smart. Yes. Yes. [Pakled ship] (Geordi is suffering, and holding his side) We want to be smart. We are smart. Yes. Yes. [Bridge] You are smart. Make us strong. Make us strong, or die. [Starbase 515 Operating Theatre] Make us strong. Do it. Make us strong. Do not try to trick us. We can tell. [Starbase 515 Operating Theatre] (The specialist has been dragged in from the golf course) Teeth are for chewing. We are strong. We have power. [Bridge] We are strong now. We have better weapons. Believe it. They are violent. Good. He is on our side now. [Engineering] We will attack. We are strong. [Bridge] Hurry. [Bridge] It did not shoot. We are not strong.
