The only reason I'm talking to you is that I have a sister, too. Family honour is important. If someone had defiled my sister I would do anything, pay anything, to find the one responsible. As much as five bars of gold-pressed latinum. Perhaps there's an element of risk here that I did not fully appreciate. This isn't about latinum. As a man with a sister, a sister with a temper, I can sympathise with you, but, how did you come here? Do you have a ship in orbit? Then take me with you. You can drop me anywhere. The man you're looking for was here several weeks ago. There was a group of aliens sitting at this table. He was asking them questions. I don't know, but they looked dangerous. They attacked him. He managed to incapacitate three of them before he was knocked down. He was thrown against that wall and fell there. (Crusher scans it with her tricorder) Who are you people? I hadn't finished yet. You'll like this. The man got what was coming to him. When they knocked him down, one of them took out a weapon and fired. He was vaporised. Ah, Commander Riker. I've been meaning to speak to you. I was wondering if you could move me to better quarters. I don't care much for the decor here. Sorry, my memory isn't what it used to be. Now that you mention it, I do remember one thing. They said they'd kill anyone who talked about what happened. Perhaps I do. Not a great deal, Commander. Just a shuttlecraft. I believe I'd like to travel for a while, see more of the galaxy. You understand. Time? If I tell you what I know, you must promise not to give me to the Klingons. Perhaps you could send me to a Federation rehabilitation colony instead. The aliens were some kind of mercenary group. They've been operating in this sector for the last six months. I heard one of them mention the Barradas system. I think they were headed there. That's all I know.
