Mister Crusher? At ease. Am I interrupting? They told me you'd be here. I found this in Josh's room. I think it belongs to you. He told me you helped him with his classes. If Josh had a weakness, it was mathematics. His mother and I thought he'd never get out of calculus. Then he found out what the Academy entrance requirements were like. That turned him around. He stayed after class, got a tutor. He really worked hard. Never gave up on anything. And he had a lot of respect for you, and everybody on the team. I realise it was his fault. That everybody could have been killed. And I want to say that, I want to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry that he let you down. [Academy hearing room] (it is now next morning)
