(a thirty-something man) Enterprise, I am Aaron Conor. I don't want to be rude, Captain, but we don't wish to interact with outsiders. I'm only responding because of your warning. Yes, I know. We have been tracking it. But our biosphere has been constructed to withstand quakes of eight point seven on the Richter Scale. Evacuate? That is not possible. There must be an alternative. Our environment is sealed. No one can get in or out. Matter-energy? Really? That's quite remarkable. No, I must stay here. But under the circumstances, I will permit a small delegation from your ship inside the biosphere. If only to see this matter-energy transportation you speak of. Yes, Captain. I cannot adequately express my appreciation to your crew. Is Hannah able to hear me? [Engineering]
