I wouldna be so high and mighty with me, Beverly Howard Crusher. I've spent more time here in the past five years than ye have in the past twenty. I'm Ned Quint. I took care of your grandmother's house and her affairs. There's a lot of things she didna talk about. Let me get rid of that candle. That candle has brought nothing but misery and bad luck to your grandmother. That candle has been a curse on your family for generations. If ye have a lick of sense, you'll listen to me right now and do away with it. Now give it to me. Howard women. Always the same stubborn fools. I wash my hands of it now. You stay on in this house and you keep that damned candle. I'll not be responsible for what happens. You probably want to be alone. I'll leave. Aye, she was a grand lady. You'll not see many more like her. You have your grandmother's fire, that's for sure. That's verra kind of you, lass, but I'll ne'er set foot in that house again. And I recommend that you dinna, either. Like I tried to tell your grandmother, the hoose is haunted. You believe what you want, lass. Just dinna light that candle. It'll bring the ghost. It's his home. Oh, he's out now, wanderin' across the land, angry, angry at being driven out. That's why he's bringing the storms. Oh, sure. But who do you think is causing the malfunction? Think what you want. See what you want. Just do as I say. Dinna light that candle or dinna go to that hoose, or before you know it, they'll be burying another Howard in this cemetery. (Ned leaves. Lightning flashes and the grave is now covered in camellias. Beverly flees) [Bridge] No! (Data pulls him out) Get away from me! You dinna understand. He's trying to kill us all. (green energy leaps out at Ned and throws him across the room)
