They've got eyes only for the programme. (Riker and Crusher enter)
Surface Station approval coming in now, Lieutenant. Two more are ready to beam in, sir. You can put the supplies on the pad. Doctor Crusher had me set the coordinates. All we need is the captain's order. (Wyatt injects the Chief and he goes down. Then Wyatt activates the transporter and stands on the pad with the supplies) [Bridge]
Bridge from Transporter Chief. Two from USS Fearless are ready to beam over. Aye, sir,
Transporter room six to Bridge. Reporting transporter console malfunction, sir.
Transporter Chief to Captain. We can't energise the beam, sir. Everything checks out but we're getting no results.
Hold your positions please. Prepare to energise. And energise.
Coordinates entered, sir.
I am unable to lock on to Commander Riker, sir.
Yes, sir. There's a lack of integrity at the landing point. [Bridge] There seems to be some kind of strange bouncing effect. [Bridge] You're lucky you made it back at all, sir. [Sickbay]
Aye negative response, sir. Negative response! Aye, sir. (Geordi arrives)
Transport locked in and ready, Doctor.
I just received coordinates, sir. Ready to transport two from the Klingon vessel. Yes, sir.
The Decius reports the Ambassador is waiting to transport.
I've locked onto Doctor Clark. I can't pick out the others. It's a mess down there. Yes, Captain.
No, sir. They didn't show up.
Transporter room one to Captain Picard. Minister Campio is beaming on board, sir.
Aye, sir. [Sickbay] (Troi is writhing in a restraining forcefield)
Aye, sir.
Negative, sir. There's too much interference. [Ruins] (what looks like a Romulan woman runs forward and grabs the artefacts)
