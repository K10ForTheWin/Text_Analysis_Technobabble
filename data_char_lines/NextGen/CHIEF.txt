I just received coordinates, sir. Ready to transport two from the Klingon vessel. Yes, sir.
No, sir. They didn't show up.
The Decius reports the Ambassador is waiting to transport.
Surface Station approval coming in now, Lieutenant. Two more are ready to beam in, sir. You can put the supplies on the pad. Doctor Crusher had me set the coordinates. All we need is the captain's order. (Wyatt injects the Chief and he goes down. Then Wyatt activates the transporter and stands on the pad with the supplies) [Bridge]
Yes, sir. There's a lack of integrity at the landing point. [Bridge] There seems to be some kind of strange bouncing effect. [Bridge] You're lucky you made it back at all, sir. [Sickbay]
Aye, sir. [Sickbay] (Troi is writhing in a restraining forcefield)
They've got eyes only for the programme. (Riker and Crusher enter)
Hold your positions please. Prepare to energise. And energise.
