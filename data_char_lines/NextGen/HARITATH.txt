I think it's some sort of shuttlecraft. Look at the markings. It must be from the Federation. We saw your ship You're the first visitor we've had in You're not human. Our great-grandparents were citizens of the Federation. But you don't want to waste time talking to us. I'm sure the Federation will be very proud of us. Wait until you see all we've accomplished. Don't you know? Oh, no, I don't guess you would. We're descendants of the original settlers, from the colony ship Artemis. [Bridge] Gosheven, look what's come. And when they did, the radiation started killing them. They'd kill all of us? Let him talk. And he describes it pretty damned well. Mister Data, I just want you to know that Gosheven doesn't speak for all of us. I see no reason to die needlessly. There are many others that feel the same way but they're very uneasy about confronting Gosheven. We do. We like to do things on our own. Why do we need to? You killed him?
