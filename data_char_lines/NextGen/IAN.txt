Hello. (Pulaski shudders) Please don't worry. Everything is okay. Captain's log, supplemental. We are faced with two major problems. Troi's child and the deadly cargo we are about to take on. In the hours since his birth, Troi's baby has continued his rapid growth and now appears, physically and mentally, to be a child of eight. Still there is no indication as to who he is, or why he is here. [Bridge] (getting on for Troi's shoulder height) I like it here, Mommy. Thank you. Do you want your supper now, too? You're welcome. Have you ever played with puppies? You should come to the nursery while the puppies are still there. Ow! Mom. My face is wet. Because Mommy said it was time to eat. I live here. No, not yet. Bye. [Bridge] I can feel that some of the people are very worried. It's me, Mommy. I'm the reason. It's me. Yes. I have to leave you now, or it'll be very bad for everyone. I have to leave now.
Deanna. Look at you. You've become a beautiful woman I'm sorry I had to go away when you were so little. I didn't want to. This is our house near Lake El'nar on Betazed. We used to live here. Deanna, let's not waste this chance. I want to hear everything about you. For a while when you were a baby. You were such a beautiful baby. Your mother and I loved you so much. I bet you don't remember me singing you to sleep at night either, but I did. There was one song you always asked me to sing. You couldn't fall asleep unless you heard it. Yes. (sings) Down in the valley, valley so low. Hang your head over, hear the wind blow. Your mother doesn't want to see you, Deanna. If you want to help her, leave. Let her have peace. Stay with me, just a little while. Deanna, it's been so long. We'll never have this chance again. Hold on to him. Don't let him run off. No, Kestra. We're going to eat in just a few minutes.
