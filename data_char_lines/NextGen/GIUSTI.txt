(a young woman) Commander, we've lost contact with the away team. No, sir. The comm. system is being jammed. Somewhere on the surface. Commander, we're picking up a vessel leaving orbit. They could have been using the planet as a shield. Sir, they are powering up their weapon systems. Minor hit on the port deflector. No damage. They're running, sir. Their speed is warp eight point seven and holding. I think they're at their maximum. Sir, we should be within phaser range in twenty three seconds. Switching to long-range scanners. Commander, the sensor image of that ship is extremely weak. It's fading. The ship doesn't register on the long-range sensors. I'm sorry, sir. We've lost them. It's no good, the signal's gone. It just disappeared. Aye, sir. [Observation lounge] I can't tell, sir. Sensors are unable to penetrate their hull.
Aye, sir. They're preparing to activate their warp drive, Commander. I'm picking up a small vessel bearing one two seven mark three three five. No, sir. It's a Klingon ship. Aye, sir.
