We are being chased by an unidentified entity travelling at warp speed. Sensors indicate a crystalline structure of indeterminate mass. We are a transport ship. Our shields are minimal. Only low level particle phasers. Do you know what this being is? we are under attack! Captain, notify our people on Boreal Three (transmission ends)
