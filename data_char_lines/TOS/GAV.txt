(a stout chap with a porcine nose) Sarek of Vulcan, do you vote to  admit Coridan to the Federation?  No! You! How do you vote, Sarek of Vulcan?  In council, his vote carries others. I will know where he stands  and why.  No. You  You will excuse me. (stalks away)  Vulcan, I would speak to you.  How do you vote on the Coridan admission?  You favour? Why?  (The room goes silent.)  That's well for you. Vulcan has no mining interest.  Illegal? You accuse us?  You call us thieves?  (Gav attacks Sarek, who shrugs him off easily.)  Understood. There will be payment for your slander, Sarek.
