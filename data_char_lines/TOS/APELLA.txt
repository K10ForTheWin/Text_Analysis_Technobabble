A quarrel by my people. A division of some skins and a hill  woman taken this morning. It's hard to divide one woman.  What?  Is it difficult to cut grooves into the barrels?  I thought my people would grow tired of killing. But you were  right. They see that it is easier than trading and it has pleasures. I  feel it myself. Like the hunt, but with richer rewards.
