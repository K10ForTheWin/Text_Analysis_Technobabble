My Commander sent for Decius.  Only in code, Commander. To inform our Praetor of this glorious  mission.  The Earth vessel? Impossible.  Commander, they stay within range. I will  tend to the centurion.  Why don't we fire, Commander?  Yes, Commander.  Now twenty full cycles, Commander. Still no  sign. I say he's been fooled. He must have gone on.  How, Commander. How?  We are beaten. Can it be true? The Praetor's finest and  proudest flagship beaten.  Yes Commander, but only for self-destruction.  Yes, Commander. At once. [Bridge] Glorious. Glorious.  They're at our mercy. Commander, I remind you of your duty. [Bridge] Still no sign of movement, Commander.  And it is our duty to crush the Praetor's enemies.  We are in the Neutral Zone. They will not enter. If you refuse,  permit me the glory of the kill, Commander.
