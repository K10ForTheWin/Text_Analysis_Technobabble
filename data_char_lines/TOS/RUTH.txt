The miners are healthy and fairly young.  Almost three years now, alone!  But they'll be down there, and we'll be up here, circling a  hundred miles above them.  Look what's happening. (hair lank, skin  slightly lined) Look at my face.  What if someone sees us like this?  I'm going back to what I was. Ugly.  Why did you hide them, Harry? Don't you trust us?  And you must be Herm Gossett.
