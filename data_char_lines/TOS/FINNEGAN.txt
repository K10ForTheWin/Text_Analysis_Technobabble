(in a dreadful cod-Irish accent) Jim.  You never know when I'm going to strike, huh, Jim? (hits him  on the jaw) How's this? Come on, come on. It's me, Finnegan. All right,  Jimmy boy. (maniacal laughter) Go ahead, lay one on me. That's what you  always wanted, isn't it? Come on. Come on.  Go! Any excuse, Jim baby. Run away! Run away! Run away!  (Along the path, he meets McCoy)  Hey, Jim baby! I see you brought out reinforcements. Ha!  Well, I'm waiting for you, Jimmy boy.  Here I am! Run! [Rocky outcrop] Jim! Find me! Can't you see me? Come and  get me! Here I am! Come on. You never could find your head with both  hands! Like it used to be, Jimmy. Remember? (finally Kirk catches up to  him, because he's lounging on a ledge) Hey, Jim  Coming up.  (He jumps on Kirk and they have a fight. Finnegan knocks Kirk down)  Get up. Get up. Get up. Always fight fair, don't you? True  officer and gentleman, you. You stupid underclassman. I've got the  edge. I'm still twenty years old. Look at you. You're an old man.  (The fight resumes, and Kirk punches Finnegan till he falls down a  rocky slope and ends up writhing in pain)  I can't move me leg. I can't feel me leg. My back is broken.  You've broken me back.  Can you feel that, now? (Kirk passes out) Sleep sweet, Jimmy  boy. Sleep as long as you like. Sleep forever, Jim boy. Forever and  forever.  (A little later, Kirk regains consciousness)  Won't you ever learn, Jim boy? You never could take me, you  know.  Sure. Name it.  Earn them!  (He throws dirt in Kirk's face and the exchange of punches resumes  until they're both too tired to continue.)  Not bad. Kind of makes up for things, huh, Jim?  I never answer questions from plebes, Jimmy boy.  I'm being exactly what you expect me to be, Jimmy boy.  (Kirk lands the final haymaker that knocks Finnegan out cold)
