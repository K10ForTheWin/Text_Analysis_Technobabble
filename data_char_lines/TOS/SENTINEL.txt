Apologies, Mister Advisor, but this Troglyte was apprehended  leaving the city. He is without a transport card so we thought you  would want to question him.  The Disrupter Vanna has disappeared. Her guard was found half  unconscious. He'd been attacked by Captain Kirk.  He did not know, sir. He did not regain his senses until I  came to his aid.
