I am unaware of any state of war between our  peoples, Captain.  Or is it your policy to kill Klingons on sight?  To bring down an attack upon their village? It is as I told you,  Maab. Earthmen fear to bargain honestly.  And different from those of my people, too, Teer. The sight of  death frightens them.  What do Earth men offer you? What have you obtained from them in  the past? Powders and liquids for the sick? We Klingons believe as you  do. The sick should die. Only the strong should live. Earthmen have  promised to teach the youth of your tribes many things. What? What  things? Cleverness against enemies? The use of weapons?  I have no quarrel with you, Captain. I wish merely to return to  my vessel.  (He grabs a knife and lunges at Kirk, who throws him easily and turns  the weapon on the Klingon.)  A small scout ship, Captain. We need the mineral, too. I was sent  to negotiate.  Kill them now.  Is the new leader of the Ten Tribes afraid? Let me kill him for  you.  We had an agreement.  She was prepared to die, Earthman.  We made an agreement, Maab. I have a right to my weapons.  (slightly out of breath) They must die. That is your law.  If true, take us to them.  First, we'll verify her story.  The next man who raises a weapon destroys all of you. You and  your primitive knives and your weapons, I'll teach you what killing  really means.
