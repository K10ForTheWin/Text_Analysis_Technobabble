(seeing a young blonde) How do you do, ma'am?  Excuse me sir but, ma'am, if I didn't know better I would  swear you were someone I left behind on Wrigley's Pleasure Planet. It's  funny, you're exactly like a girl that  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I mean, I know it's impossible,  of course.  Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
