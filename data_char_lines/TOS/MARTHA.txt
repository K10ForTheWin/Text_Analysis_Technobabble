All this beauty, and now Mister Hendorff dead, somebody  watching us. It's frightening.  But when a man and woman fall in love,  Love is when two people are  (Chekov demonstrates by putting his arm around her waist.)  Every time I think of the Enterprise  burning up and us  Captain, we're trapped,  The Enterprise is up there  But they can't. You said that Vaal takes care of them.  Yes, I suppose if someone were to fall off a cliff or  something, that might upset the balance of the population. Then they  would need a replacement.  But these people, I mean, if they don't know anything about.  What I mean is, they don't seem to have any natural er. I mean, how is  it, done?  You know, if it weren't for Vaal this place would be a  paradise.  (They are watched by a local couple)  Pav, can the ship really break away?  Will we be able to get back aboard?  No, not if you're with me.  (They kiss .) 
I can't tell him anything, Jim. He's been like this since the  company of actors arrived.  He went to town. He called. He's on his way back.  (The lovely young blonde Lenore Karidian enters, and Kirk beams)  At least he has peace now. He never really had that before. Oh,  why was Tom killed if what he suspected wasn't true?  Oh, Jim. How I'll miss him. (bursts into tears and leaves)
