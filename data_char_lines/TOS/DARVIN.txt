Mister Baris is the Federation Undersecretary in Charge of  Agricultural Affairs in this quadrant.  SPOCK; That gives him the authority.  The storage compartments containing the quadrotriticale.

You can't deny he's disrupted this station.  I have nothing to say. (Kirk thrusts the tribbles into his  face) All right, I poisoned the grain! Take them away.  I don't know. I never saw one before in my life, and I hope I  never see one of those fuzzy miserable things again.
