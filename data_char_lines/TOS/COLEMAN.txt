Exposure to radiation.  Nothing I've ever encountered.  (Janice wakes)  Doctor McCoy.  (He goes over to Janice)  Doctor Lester is near death.  I'm sure it is.  I don't know. I'm not sure.  It just began.  Probably no one will believe it.  That's all we can ask for. How can death be explained now?  You killed every one of the staff. You sent them where you  knew the celebium shielding was weak. Now why didn't you kill him? You  had the perfect opportunity.  I gave you every minute you asked for.  You couldn't because you love him. You want me to be his  murderer.  I won't become a murderer.  It has nothing to do with you. It's a symptom of the  developing radiation illness.  Yes, Captain. Yes.  Doctor Lester and her staff have been under my supervision for  two years. If you don't follow my recommendations, responsibility for  her health or her death will be yours.  Yes, Captain.  Nurse, administer the sedative.  Nurse Chapel, you have your orders.  Quiet would be best for you.  I'm in charge now.  He was taken off your case by Captain Kirk.  It was done for your own protection, Doctor Lester.  She is suffering from the delusion of being Captain Kirk.  The paranoia has been developing for the past six months. The  radiation seems to have intensified it. She must be kept sedated.  Of course.  (Chapel leaves)  (Janice sees her reflection in a mirror)  You are insane, Doctor Lester. Captain's log, stardate unknown. I have lost track  of time. I am still held captive in a strange body and separated from  all my crew. [Sickbay] (Janice wakes. There is a single restraining strap  across the bed)  What happened?  The only way to prevent the transference is by the death of  Janice Lester. You must carry out the execution.  I have done everything else for you. But I will not murder for  you.  It is. [Brig] (which strangely looks straight out into the  corridor)  You are, you are as I loved you.  I'd like to take care of her.
