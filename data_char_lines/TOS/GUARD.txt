Yes, sir. Nothing could get in.  It's not working, sir. It seems to be stuck. 
Get in line.  (They disarm and disable the Eminian guards) 
Hey. Nomad, stop. Nomad, this way.  (They fire at it, and the inevitable follows. Strike two more  red-shirts. Nomad uses the access tubes between decks instead of the  turbolift.)  (In another corridor.) 
Yes, mistress.  (The women - sorry, Eymorg - leave.) Ship's log. Lieutenant Sulu recording. I am holding  the Enterprise in orbit about planet Sigma Draconis Seven.  Captain Kirk's hunch that Spock's brain is on this planet appears to be  correct. Ensign Chekov remains on the surface  to act as liaison between the Captain and the Enterprise.  {Council room]
Just a minute, sir. Hold it.  (Sulu karate-chops him into unconsciousness)  [Guard room] (There's a knock at the door) 
Captain. (Kalinda has appeared so they move away from the door)  Captain. However perfect they are, there don't seem to be very many of  them. Why...  You'll have one, sir, if I have to rip one of the Kelvans apart  to get it for you.  Yes, sir. 
Do you have authorisation from security, sir?  I'll have to check with Security Chief Sulu, sir. 
What's the matter? Did you hurt yourself, kid?  Cute kid, ain't he?  Yeah? How? 
Centurion, have you clearance for this area?  I do not recognise you.  I must see your authorisation, sir. 
You, what is your business here?  (A second car arrives and Kirk turns his camera on it.)  It's Party Secretary Daras.
