Captain Kirk, you've made it.  Yes, sir.  I'm sorry, sir. Entry is forbidden.  The commander, sir. You'll have to step back, please.  I'm sorry, sir. You are no longer.  At first I refused, but then after a while I found I couldn't  help myself. I met this girl. She's one of them. I've never known  anyone like her. She brought me aboard to show them operation of the  ship. Bridge controls, life support. She explained that they wanted to  know. I didn't understand at first, but I do now. So will you, sir.  I tried to stop him. You hurt him.  He was my captain.
