Where's the captain? Which one of you is the captain?  My name is Van Gelder. I want asylum.  I want your promise first, your word that you won't take me  back there, to Tantalus.  No! No. No, I'm not going back! I'll disable your vessel first.  You choose, Captain. I'll destroy your control panel.  (Gelder is distracted and Spock neck-pinches him)  You smart, button-pushing brass hat. Wash your hands of it. Is  that your system? You're both quite sure of yourselves, aren't you?  Quite expert. Take him back. Let someone else worry about him.  My name? My name is Simon Van Gelder. (in great pain) I was the  director of, director at the Tantalus colony.  I was a graduate of, of. I was assistant to Doctor. I knew. I  knew, but they've erased it.  Edited, adjusted, subverted me, but I won't forget! I won't  forget! You, you're so blind ignorant. You believe I belong back there,  don't you? Dead or alive. Well, I won't let you take me back. I'm not  going! I'll die first! Do you hear? I'm not going! No! No! No.  [Bridge] I'm not a criminal! I do not require neural  neutraliser.  A room. A device. Door. Control panel. I see it. A device. A  light! The light!  (screams)  [Treatment room] No! No, no, no.  No! No. No, don't let them! You must warn  your captain. No! No! Don't let him stay! Don't let him stay! Don't!  No. No. Don't hypo me. Please, don't hypo me. I'll try not to fight.  I'll try. But you must listen. Warn your Captain. Doctor Adams. Doc,  Doctor Adams will destroy.  Right death.  You must open my mind. Let me warn you and explain to you.  Yes, I begin to feel it.  We are Simon Van Gelder.  He can reshape any mind he chooses. He used it to erase our  memories, put his own thoughts there. He was surprised it took so much  power. We fought him, remember? But we grew so tired, our minds so  blank, so open, that any thought he placed there became our thoughts.  Our minds so empty like a sponge, needing thoughts, begging. Empty.  Loneliness. So lonely to be sitting there empty, wanting any word from  him. Love.  Hate.  Live.  Die.  Such agony to be empty.  Lonely.  So empty.  So empty.  [Treatment room]
