The distress call definitely came from one of the solar systems  in this sector.  Negative. It was so badly garbled all we got was the name  Constellation, then we lost it.  Sir, I'm picking up a ship's disaster beacon.  No answer, Captain. All I get is the automatic beacon.  Red alert. Red alert. Man your battle stations.  I can't raise the Constellation, sir. I'm still getting the  distress beacon, but there's heavy subspace interference. It's almost  blocking the signal.  Aye, aye, sir.  Mister Spock, communication's damaged. We're unable to override  interference. [Constellation Auxiliary Control] (to Spock) Sir, Deck seven reports power failure in main  energisers. Implementing emergency procedures. (another hit) Severe  casualties reported on decks three and four. Damage control party  sealing off inner hull rupture.  Mister Spock, we've pierced the interference locally.  No, sir, but I've got ship-to-ship communications back. Picking  up Captain Kirk.  Enterprise to shuttlecraft. Come in, shuttlecraft. [Shuttlecraft] Enterprise to shuttlecraft. Come in,  shuttlecraft. Come in, shuttlecraft.  Mister Spock, the transporter is now operational. 
They are receiving us, Captain.  Aye, sir.  I have Starbase now, Captain.  Aye, sir.
