There you are. I just wanted one more look at you. The man who  killed my father.  Your friend? You hated him all your life! That's why you killed  him, you murderer! You murderer! You murderer!  (She dissolves into tears.)  Mister Cogley, we've got to stop this. Make him take a ground  assignment. I realise it wasn't his fault. I won't make any trouble.  Make him change his plea.  I was just so upset that night. I'm sorry.  But I have to. I never realised how close you and Dad had been  until I read through some papers he wrote, letters to Mother and me. I  don't know how I ever could've thought that you. Mister Cogley, ruining  Jim won't change what's happened.  I was just thinking of Jim.
