I've answered it on all frequencies, sir. They don't reply.  Directly ahead. Definitely an Earth-style signal.  None, Captain.  Yes, Doctor. [Laboratory] Captain Kirk?  I've got volunteers standing by ready to  help you, sir.  [Laboratory] But Captain, if you become too ill to  Mister Spock.  [Laboratory] Here are those figures you asked for. Twelve to the tenth  power. Metabolic rate seventy two percent. Production of nucleic acids  reduced to thirty three percent of normal. Conventional chronological  progression one hundred by three point six.  Data has been fed into the computers,  Mister Spock. Stand by.  Landing party, this is the Enterprise.  Computer indicates one hundred seventy hours, Mister  Spock. 
No word from Mister Sulu, sir.  Captain!  But what about  Yes, sir.  Mister Spock, which one? What do we do?  Status report, green. 
There go his engines, sir.  He's had it, unless we put our deflector screen around him.  We're protecting him, sir. We won't be able to hold it long.  There she goes.  We're clearing the asteroid belt now, Captain.  You can feel their eyes when they look at you, like something  grabbing hold of you. Did you notice that?  Preorbital course locked in, sir.  We'll make orbit, sir. A temporary one.  Traverse parallel three and four.  About eleven miles, bearing one two one from the mining  company.  Course plotted and all systems in operation.  Out of orbit, sir. 
Sir?  Smart boy, switching to the top dog.  The booth for this one, sir?  Orders, sir?  Yes, sir. [Engineering] (Scott distracts the guard outside the door so  McCoy can give him a hypo.)
