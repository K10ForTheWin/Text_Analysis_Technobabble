What are you? Why are you here? You have something to speak?  We do not know Spock.  Ah, yes, brain. You spoke to Luma also of brain, but we do not  understand.  I do not know these things you speak of.  We know only here below and here above. This is our place. You  are not Morg. You are stranger.  You hurt Luma. It is not permitted again to hurt anyone.  If you wish to return to your home, you may go.  In charge?  I am leader. There is no other.  Control? Controller?  No. It is not permitted. Never! Controller is alone, apart. We  serve Controller. No other is permitted near.  You have come to destroy us.  Brain and brain! What is brain? It is Controller, is it not?  You lie! You know me. You have said that. You came to take back  the Controller.  They will be prevented.  I must learn what to do. (to Luma) Come with me. You will keep  them here.  No. Go away.  (Spock holds her wrists, then finally presses the red button. The belts  fly off.)  We will die. You must not take the Controller away. We will all  die. The Controller is young and powerful. Perfect!  You will give life to my people for ten thousand years to come.  The old one is finished! There is no other than this and will not  be another for ten thousand years.  He must stay. He must stay!  I do not know.  It was the old knowledge.  I put upon my head the Teacher.  The great Teacher of all the ancient knowledge.  (There is a transparent helmet with what look like a whole lot of  syringes sticking through it.)  I cannot. Only by command of the ancients may I understand.  No! The knowledge is forbidden! I must not know the secret! I  will be punished!  (A control panel comes on and she goes quiet.)  (confident, assured) Gentlemen, the Controller's explanation of  the functioning of the Teacher is essentially correct. However, he is  giving no credit to me. I provide the means whereby the knowledge is  used. Without me, Captain  Thank you, Doctor. That was very gracious.  Good, Captain Kirk. Then you also appreciate that without the  Teacher, I would not have the knowledge to use that which you have  thoughtfully provided.  (She points a phaser at him.)  So it is. That is the knowledge you have brought me. Do not move.  If your weapon kills, it will kill you.  The Controller die? The Controller will live for ten thousand  years, and we shall give him all our devotion.  Why do you not understand that the need of my people for their  Controller is greater than your need for your friend.  Do not! I do not know killing. I do not wish to kill.  (Scott groans and faints, distracting her so Kirk can grab the phaser.)    The commandment must be fulfilled.  Correct.  Three of your hours.  I would not.  No!  I will not betray my people. The Controller will stay.  No!  (McCoy goes over to the device, and Kirk adjusts it onto his head.  McCoy winces in pain as knowledge is fed into his brain, then falls to  his knees.)  You will have him back and we will be destroyed.  We will die.  They will not help us without the pain.  We will die above in the cold. 
Never a word, but I'm dying to learn.  Or a handsome gentleman. Why don't we?
