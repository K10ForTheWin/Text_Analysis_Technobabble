I am ready. May I have the knife, please?  I am ready, Jaris.  Let us begin. Let the circle not be broken. Concentrate upon the  flame which burns upon the altar of truth.  Yes, there is something here. Something terrible. I feel its presence.  Fear, anger, hatred. Anger feeds the flame. Oh! Oh! There is evil here.  Monstrous, terrible evil. Consuming hunger. Hatred of all that lives.  Hatred of women. A hunger that never dies. It is strong, overpowering.  An ancient terror. It has a name. Beratis, Kesla, Redjac! Devouring all  life, all light. A hunger that will never die!  Redjac! Redjac!  (The lights go out, and she screams. When the lights come on again, the  flame has gone out. Scott is standing holding Sybo in his arms, then he  lets her go and she falls forward across McCoy's lap. There is a knife  in her back.  Later...)
