(a thin male) You have been identified as the star  ship Enterprise, Captain James T. Kirk last known to be in command.  I am Sub-commander Tal of the Romulan fleet. Your  ship is surrounded, Captain. You will surrender immediately, or we will  destroy you.  Who is that beside you?  Vulcan. (his communicator beeps and he answers it)  Yes, Commander. Yes, Commander. No one should decide quickly to die,  Captain. We give you one of your hours. If you do not surrender your  ship  at the end of that time, your destruction is certain. We will be open  to communication should you wish it.  The subspace message will take three weeks to  reach Starfleet. The decision is yours, Captain. One hour. [Briefing room] We have you under our weapons, Enterprise. You  cannot escape.  Commander?
