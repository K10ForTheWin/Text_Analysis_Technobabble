USS Enterprise from starships Lexington and  Excalibur. Both ships report simulated hits in sufficient quantity and  location to justify awarding the surprise engagement to Enterprise.  Our compliments to the M-5 unit, and regards to  Captain Dunsel. Wesley out.  Enterprise. Jim. Have you gone mad? What are  you trying to prove? Break off the attack! Jim, we have fifty three  dead here, twelve on the Excalibur. If you can hear us, stop the  attack!  Jim, why don't you answer? Jim! Answer! Come  in, Jim!  Jim, break off your attack!  All ships damaged in unprovoked attack.  Excalibur Captain Harris and first officer dead. Many casualties. We  have damage, but are still able to manoeuvre. The Enterprise refuses to  answer and is continuing attack. I still have an effective battle force  and believe the only way to stop the Enterprise is to destroy her.  Request permission to proceed. Wesley, commanding attack force, out.
