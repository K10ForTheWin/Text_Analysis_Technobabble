Captain Kirk, this is Nilz Baris. He's out from Earth to take  charge of the development project on Sherman's Planet.  Mister Spock.  Quadrotriticale is the only earth grain that grows on Sherman's  Planet. We have several tons of it here on the station. It's very  important that grain gets to Sherman's Planet safely. Mister Baris  thinks that Klingon agents may try to sabotage it.  Captain, couldn't you at least post a couple of guards? We do  have a large number of ships passing through.  Captain, may I speak to you a minute? (takes him aside) Look, I  don't want them here, but I don't have the authority to refuse.  What's wrong?
