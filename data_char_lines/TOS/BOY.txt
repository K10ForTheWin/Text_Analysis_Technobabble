You open up and you'll be  scragged from every window in the street. I can fix it for ya.  Who you callin' a babe?  You calling me a babe? (brandishes his little knife.)  Sure.  What's in it for me?  A piece of the action.  I figure it's got to be a thick percentage or you wouldn't be  trying to hit Krako.  Is that a contract?  You'll know what to do.

(The guards grin as he runs over to them.)  Come on, why don't you gang up on me? I'll cut off your head and  throw it in your face!
