How many humans like me on this ship?  Hundreds. All human, like me. That's exciting. Is that the  right word?  I'd like to see your ship now. All of it. The people and  everything.  I'm sorry.  Are you a girl? Is that a girl?  After that I found other things to eat, just growing around.  The memory banks still worked. They talked to me, and I talked  back.  Four?  That, that Captain. Kirk?  Why does he call me Mister Evans?  He's not, well, he isn't like Captain Ramart.  Do you like me?  Some, the other ship, they didn't like me. I tried. I'm trying  to make people like me. I want them to like me.  I brought you a present.  (A bottle of perfume.)  Do you like that kind?  It's a present.  Can't you stay and talk a little while?  You got a deal, friend. (slaps her bottom)  I thought. Don't be angry. I didn't, I wanted.  Don't be angry.  I will.  Want to see something? (puts three cards face down) Turn them  over.  (They have pictures of Rand on them)  Oh, I can do a lot of card tricks. One of the men on the  Antares showed me.  (The cards return to normal)  Captain? I'm supposed to ask you something. Why shouldn't I? I  don't know how to explain it.  Well, in the corridor I saw. When Janice, when Yeoman Rand  was. (slaps Kirk's bottom) I did that to her. She didn't like it. She  said you'd explain it to me.  I don't know.  Can I come with you?  I won't get in the way.  It wasn't very well constructed.  I don't know.  Oh, I, I watched them play on the Antares. Can I try?  I know what it is. Let's play.  No, it wasn't.  No, it isn't.  Can I talk to you, alone.  But I don't need her. I want to talk to you.  But she's not as. She doesn't. She's not the same. Not like  you. She's, she's just a girl. You're, you smell like a girl. All the  other girls on the ship they, they look just like Tina. You're the only  one who looks like you. You can understand, can't you? You know about  being with somebody? Wanting to be? If I had the whole universe I'd  give it to you. When I see you, I feel like I'm hungry all over.  Hungry. Do you know how that feels?  [Bridge] No, sir. Is that all?  Oh, I won't hit her like that anymore.  Everything I do or say is wrong. I'm in the way, I don't know  the rules, and when I learn something and try to do it, suddenly I'm  wrong!  I don't know what I am or what I'm supposed to be, or even  who. I don't know why I hurt so much inside all the time.  What if you care for someone? What do you do?  You don't think Janice. You. She could love me!  She can.  She is.  But if I did what you said! If I was gentle!  Then what am I going to do?  You don't.  I'm trying, but I don't know how.  I don't want to do that.  I don't want to do that.  You were going to teach me how to fight.  That looks hard.  Oh!  (Sam laughs.)  Don't laugh at me.  Don't laugh at me!  (Sam disappears.)  He shouldn't have done that. It's not nice to laugh at people.    He's gone.  He's gone! I didn't mean to do that. He made me do it! He  laughed at me.  What are you going to do to me?  I won't let them hurt me. I'll make them go away, too.  No! (phaser disappears)  He was going to hurt me.  I won't let you.  I won't let them hurt me.  You wanted to ask me something, he said.  Why?  Yes. There was a warped baffle-plate on the shield of their  energy pile. I made it go away. It would've blown up anyway. Well they  weren't nice to me! They wanted to get rid of me. They don't now.  I don't know.  (Charlie leaves)  You're trying to change course, Captain. You can't do that. I  want to get to Colony Five as soon as we can.  You don't need all that subspace chatter.  Very nice, Mister Ears. Oh, I can make him do anything, whirl  around, laugh, anything.  Don't you think he's funny? I think he's funny.  I have something for you. (a rose) Pink is  your favourite, isn't it?  Don't ever lock your door on me again, Janice. I love you.  You. I only want to be nice to you. I can give you anything.  Just, just tell me.  I love you.  Then show me.  Why did she do that? I loved her, but she wasn't nice at all.  What you did wasn't nice either, but I still need you, Captain. The  Enterprise isn't quite like the Antares. Running the Antares was easy.  You have to be nice. All right? (gives pain)  Why?  If you try to hurt me again, I'll make a lot of people go  away.  I won't tell you. Growing up isn't so much. I'm not a man, and  I can do anything! You can't.  [Corridor] He had a mean look. I had to freeze him. I like happy looks.  (enters room) Aren't you coming in? (A forcefield activates in the doorway so  No. No laughing!  (The shadows freeze, then a woman with no face feels her way around the  corner)  [Bridge] It's my game, Captain. You have to find out. Like you said,  that's how the game's played. You can have it now. I've locked on  course for Colony Five again. (leaves)  I can make you all go away anytime I want to.  I've got your ship, Captain.  I could've sent you away before, but I didn't.  Don't make me do it now.  Don't push me. (gives Kirk pain) Sorry. I'm sorry but. Stop  it. I said stop it!  Oh.  No! Oh, no, please, don't let them take me. I can't live with  them anymore. You're my friends. You said you were my friends,  remember? When I came aboard! Please, I want to go home. Take me home.  I won't do it again. Please, I'll be good. I won't ever do it  again. I'm sorry about the Antares. I'm sorry! When I came aboard!  Please, I want to go with you. Help me!  Oh, please, don't let them take me. I can't even touch them!  Janice, they can't feel. Not like you! They don't love!  Please, I want to stay. (fades away)
