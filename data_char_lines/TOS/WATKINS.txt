But, Mister Scott, the board shows correct.  Yes, sir.  (Watkins goes off into an adjoining room and checks a console and some  panels in there. Then he is confronted by Losira.)  Who are you?  You know all about me. I've never seen you before.  This is the matter-antimatter integrator control. That's the  cut off switch.  Mister Scott, there's a strange woman who knows the entire  plan of the Enterprise.  (But by the time Scott gets there, Watkins has screamed and Losira has  turned sideways into a vertical line, then vanished.)
