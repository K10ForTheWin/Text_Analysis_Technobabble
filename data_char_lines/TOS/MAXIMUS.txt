Hold! Don't move! Hands in the air!  (Armed police round them up.)  Four fleeing fish. A fine haul. Flavius Maximus.  (Flavius attacks him and gets knocked down.)  You have been too long absent from the games, Flavius. The  first citizen will be pleased. Runaway slaves are always welcome.  (removes Spock's hat) No, not slaves. Barbarians. It's been a long time  since I've watched barbarians die in the arena.  Captain's log, stardate 4040.9. Uniformed police  like those of Earth, a great city like Rome with automobiles.  Astonishing similarities to twentieth-century Earth, down to the fine  carbon steel in the bars.  [Prison] (Spock and McCoy carry Flavius into a cell.)  The first citizen? Why would he bother with arena bait like  you?  Perhaps?  Flavius. Your friends are waiting for you. You've already been  matched for the morning games. Come.  Put a sword in your hand, and you'll fight. I know you,  Flavius, you're as peaceful as a bull.  (Two guards take Flavius away.)  You three come with us.  No talking. Outside.  Outside!
