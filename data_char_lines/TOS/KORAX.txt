We have been in space for five months. What we choose as  recreation is our own business.  Get it away from me.  Get out of here with that parasite.  Take it away!  The Earthers like those fuzzy things, don't they?  No. I just remembered. There is one Earthman who doesn't remind  me of a Regulan blood worm. That's Kirk. A Regulan blood worm is soft  and shapeless, but Kirk isn't soft. Kirk may be a swaggering,  overbearing, tin-plated dictator with delusions of godhood, but he's  not soft.  (Chekov leaps to his feet)  That's right, and if I think that Kirk is a Denebian slime  devil, well that's my opinion too.  Of course, I'd say that Captain Kirk deserves his ship. We like  the Enterprise. We, we really do. That sagging old rust bucket is  designed like a garbage scow. Half the quadrant knows it. That's why  they're learning to speak Klingonese.  You're right, I should. I didn't mean to say that the Enterprise  should be hauling garbage. I meant to say that it should be hauled away  as garbage.  (There's a fight, of course. Scott's first right cross sends Korax  flying over a table. After that, it's the Klingons versus Starfleet,  with the barman beating a retreat and Jones taking the opportunity to  help himself to drinks from the dispensing machine. Finally he decides  to leave with his spoils and is about to enjoy his last glass when the  Security guards rush in followed by the Barman, who takes the glass  just before it reaches Jones' lips. So he takes another out of his  pocket instead.) Captain's Log, stardate 4525.6. A small disturbance  between the Klingon crew and members of the Enterprise crew has broken  out aboard Space Station K7. I am forced to cancel shore leave for both  ships.  [Briefing room] (Ten men are lined up. Chekov has a nice bruise on  his cheek.)
