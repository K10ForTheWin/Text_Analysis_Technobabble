We are aware of your identity, Captain.  Delay us no longer.  They love life greatly to struggle so.  Captain Kirk! We have decided that one specimen will be  sufficient. You will come with us.  Indeed, the prime ingredient.  We did not kill them. Their own fears killed them.  If you live, you will have your answer. [Bed area] We find it necessary to have the co-operation of one of your men  in our efforts.  Come, then.  (McCoy puts down his bag and tricorder, then the three vanish.)  [Laboratory] (Now it is McCoy who is being crucified from the  chains.)  All must proceed without interference.  Be patient.  Perhaps.  We know.  If Gem's planet is the one that will be saved, we must make  certain beyond any doubt whatsoever they are worthy of survival.  Her planet will be fortunate.  Time grows short.  No. We only created the circumstances. That was necessary.  Behold. That is most significant. An instinct new to the essence  of her being is generating.  She is afraid.  We have failed?  True.
