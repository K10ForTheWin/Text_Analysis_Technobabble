Joy to you, friends.  You be strangers. Come for the Festival, are ya?  Got a place to sleep it off yet? Go round to Reger's house. He's  got rooms. But you'll have to hurry. It's almost the Red Hour.  (The town hall clock shows a few minutes to six o'clock.)  Tula, these folks come for the Festival. Your daddy can put them  up, can't he?  Tula, come!  (Windows are broken, fights break out, a woman jumps on Kirk and kisses  him.)  Morning, friends.
