Photo lab. [Dark room] (Kirk is checking reels of film)  All right. Where's the other one?  Your partner. I saw you looking that was and I saw somebody  move in there.  No. Nobody should have been able to. [Briefing room] Now, look, Mister. You and I had better  start communicating. I want to know how you got in here. That's a  simple question. Give me a simple answer. Nobody saw you. You got all  the way inside without tripping any alarm. How did you do it?  Don't try to be funny. How did you get in?  You seem to think this is some kind of a game.  All right. What did you say your name was?  And how did you get inside a top security installation, James  T. Kirk?  That worries you a little bit, huh? What is that, a radio?  Transmitter of some kind?  You can be more specific than that, Kirk. I don't like  mysteries.  I'll have it disassembled and examined. We are not dummies,  mister. We know how to find out things we want to know. (tosses it to  the guard standing nearby) What is that? Is that a uniform of some  kind?  Kirk, maybe you don't realise how serious this is. Sabotage of  a government installation  No. We stopped you in time. But what would you have done if we  hadn't found you?  Is that what you're here for? Nothing at all?  All right, Kirk. Maybe this will make you laugh. Sabotage,  espionage, unauthorised entry, burglary. How are those for starters?  And I can think up lots more if you don't start talking.  I am going to lock you up for two hundred years.  See what that is, airman.  (It's Spock, who neck-pinches the hapless airman. Kirk punches Lt.  Colonel Fellini's lights out.)
