Don't hurt me, please.  No, please, don't. I didn't do anything.  No, please don't.  No, don't. Don't hurt.  Don't, please.  Don't hurt me.  But I remember the things you Grups did, burning, yelling,  hurting people.  You're not going to hurt?  Grups don't help.  You know.  You got a foolie, is that it, and you want me to play, but I  can't. I don't know the rules. I've got to know the rules.  A game, you know. You can't play a game without rules. Even Grups  ought to know that.  You are. They will, when Onlies get old.  That was when they started to get sick in the before time. We  hid, then they were gone. Am I doing all right?  Yes. They died, but that was after the awful things.  Of course not. We're here, aren't we?  All there are.  Miri.  Pretty?  Yes, I know that. Them and their pills and things.  That's a bad place.  All right. Do you have a name, too?  I like that name.  Do you really?  I wouldn't lie to you, either, Jim. I remember the Grups, but  you're nice. You're different.  It's already starting. I knew it would. Just like it did with the  Grups. It'll spread all over you, and you'll yell, and you'll try to  hurt everybody and then you'll die. I knew it would! I knew it would!  Captain's Log, stardate 2713.6. The building Miri  led us to also housed an automatic transmission station, which sent out  the signal that drew us to this planet. We also discovered something  else. That the blues  blotches, characteristic of the unknown disease had appeared on each of  us, with the exception of Mister Spock. There was a well-equipped  laboratory in the building.  Doctor McCoy took tissue samples of each of us in an attempt to isolate  the organism responsible.  [Laboratory] It spreads real fast. I know. When you're old, it covers you like  anything.  All right, Jim.  Sure. (leave, holding hands)  Her name was Louise. She was just a little bit older than I am  when it happened. Oh, Jim. (she hugs him)  [Laboratory] (sharpening pencils) Are these enough, Jim?  No, I don't mind.  I know. I know. Don't you think I've heard them talk? They have  such little time to do this dumb thing of theirs, this baninski thing.  If we get her away. that Yeoman, that's one person less to start off  with.  It's easy. She's always asking me about the youngest little  Onlies, little ones. What if they get sick, who takes care of them? Do  they have enough to eat? Where do they sleep? I'll just tell her one of  you fell down and got hurt.  All right, you.  Not one, two. Because he'll try to find her.  The Captain. He'll try to find her, but he won't. Mister  Lovey-dovey.  What's the matter with you? How should I know?  Don't you feel all right?  Jim, I don't want anything to happen to you.  I don't care.  Sometimes it happens.  That's not true. It just happens sometimes.  No! No! No!  [Schoolroom] I know.  No.  Listen to him.  I did. Why do you think I brought him here? Tell them, Jim.  No, please. No! (the other children join in as the little blonde  girl watches, smiling)  Listen to him. He's telling the truth.  Look at my arm, Jahn. It's happening to me. He's telling the  truth.  Of course it is.  [Bridge]
