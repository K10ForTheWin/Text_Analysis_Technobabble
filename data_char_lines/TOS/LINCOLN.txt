Captain Kirk, I believe. A pleasure to make  your acquaintance, sir.  No need to check your voice telegraph device.  Do I gather that you recognise me?  And appearances can be most deceiving, but not  in this case, James Kirk. I am Abraham Lincoln.  I have been described in many ways, Mister  Spock, but never with that word.  Illusion? Captain, will you permit me to come  aboard your vessel? No doubt you have devices which can check my  reality.  Do you still measure time in minutes?  Then you should be directly over my position  in. There. Exactly twelve and one half minutes. Until then, Captain.  (And the orange planet is back in view)
