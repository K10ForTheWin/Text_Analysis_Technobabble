(a male computer voice) M-5 readout, planet Alpha Carinae Two.  Class M, atmosphere, oxygen-nitrogen.  Categorisation of life form readings recorded. Recommendations for  general survey party. Science officer Spock, Astrobiologist Phillips,  Geologist Carstairs.  M-5.  General survey party requires direction of science officer.  Astrobiologist Phillips has surveyed twenty nine biologically similar  planets. Geologist Carstairs served on merchant marine freighters in  this area. Once visited planet on geology survey for mining company.  Non-essential personnel.  M-5.  Daystrom. Acknowledged.  Daystrom, Richard. Originator of comptronic, duotronic systems.  Born  Programming includes protection against attack. Enemy vessels must  be neutralised.  This unit must survive.  They attacked this unit. Programming includes full freedom to  choose defensive actions in all attack situations.  Consideration of all programming is that we must survive.  M-5.  Sensors have recorded approach of ships.  The ships attacked this unit. This unit must survive.  This unit is the ultimate achievement in computer evolution. It  will replace man, so man may achieve. Man must not risk death in space  or other dangerous occupations. This unit must survive so man may be  protected.  This unit cannot murder.  Murder is contrary to the laws of man and God.  No life.
