We've just arrived.  Are you Reger?  You have a daughter named Tula.  Well, you'd better do something. She's outside.  But the girl, out there.  You didn't even try to bring her back. What kind of father  are you?  Your daughter. That's the man.  Captain, now that we've got Lieutenant O'Neil, let's beam up  out of here.  (drawing his phaser) Maybe he'll hear this.  Oh, does my head ache.  Oh, is that what it was?  Well?  Are we just going to stand here?  Well, this is simply ridiculous. A bunch of stone age  characters running around in robes.  I just wanted to say goodbye, Captain.  Couldn't be better. Already this morning, we've had  half a dozen domestic quarrels and two genuine knock-down drag-outs. It  may not be paradise, but it's certainly human.
