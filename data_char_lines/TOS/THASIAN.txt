I have taken my form from centuries ago, so that I may  communicate with you. We did not realise until too late that the boy  had gone, and we are saddened that his escape cost the lives of the  first ship. We could not help them, but we have returned your people  and your ship to you. Everything is as it was.  That would be impossible.  We gave him the power so he could live. He will use it,  always, and he would destroy you and your kind, or you would be forced  to destroy him to save yourselves.  We offer him life, and we will take care of him. Come,  Charles.
