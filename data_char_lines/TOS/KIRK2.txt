I order you, Let me go! Traitors! Spock, get these men off me!  What is this?  You traitorous pig. I'll hang you up by your Vulcan ears. I'll  have you all executed!  Has the whole galaxy gone crazy? What kind of a uniform is this?  Where's your beard? What's going on? Where's my personal guard?  All right, Spock. Whatever your game is, I'll play it. You want  credits, I'll give them to you. You'll be a rich man. A command of your  own? I can swing that, too.  Spock. What is it that will buy you? Power?  Power, Spock? I can get that for you! [Corridor]
How do you do, Miss Chapel?  [Dining room] Thank you. I'm more or less on parole, I understand.  I know, I know. I'd hate to be torn between commander and  fianc√©e myself.  Has he confided in you?  Unless something's gone wrong with his mind.  Nurse, if I gave you a direct order to betray him  Androids don't eat, Miss Chapel.  The difference is your weakness, Captain, not mine.  Perhaps, but I will never starve, sir.  George Samuel Kirk, your brother. Only you call him Sam.  Yes, with his wife and three sons.  No, Captain. He said he was continuing his research and that he  wanted to be transferred to Earth colony two.  Doctor Korby has considerable cargo to beam aboard. I'll have to  go over our destination schedule with him.  Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your  half-breed interference, do you hear?  You look upset, Mister Spock. Is everything all right up here?  Good. I'll beam up shortly with Doctor Korby and party.  (leaves)  I looked it over. I think you'll find planet  Midas Five an excellent choice.  Thank you. I felt quite at home on the Enterprise.  [Bedroom] No.  It is illogical. (she disintegrates him)  [Korby's study]
