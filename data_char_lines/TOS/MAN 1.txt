Tyree's woman.  We won't trust this division to Apella.  It's a trap. The woman's tricked us.  (He stabs her. Another man shoots McCoy in the arm. Yutan fires back,  then there is a good old-fashioned hand-to-hand struggle. Tyree smashes  one man's head repeatedly with a large rock, until Kirk stops him. He  goes to his wife.)
