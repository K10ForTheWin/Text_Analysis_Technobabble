I am Marplon. It is your hour. Happy communing.  Have no fear, friend. The effect is harmless. My name is  Marplon. I was too late to save your first two friends. They have been  absorbed. Beware of them.  (Spock is released.)  He is unharmed, unchanged. I am the third man in Reger's  triad. We have been awaiting your return.  Whatever you may call yourselves, you are in fulfillment of  prophecy. We ask your help.  He will join us. He is immune to absorption. Hurry. We have  not much time.  I cannot answer your questions now. Landru, he will hear. Here  are your weapons. You may need them.  (Lawgivers enter)  Behave as you saw your Captain behave. It is done.  It is the gift of Landru. (goes over to Kirk) I've brought  your signalling devices. You may need them.  The prophecy says  No, no.  We do not see him. We hear him, in the Hall of Audiences.  (reluctantly) Yes.  No.  He's still alive. He is here now. He sees. He hears. We have  destroyed ourselves. Please, no more.  This is the Hall of Audiences.  But this is Landru.  Landru speaks here.  (Kirk and Spock remove the robes and leave the staves propped by the  open door.)  Landru! He comes!  Is this truly Landru?
