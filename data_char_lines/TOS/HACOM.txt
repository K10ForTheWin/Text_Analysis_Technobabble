You came for the Festival?  Then how come you here?  Reger, these are young men. They are not old enough to be  excused.  Well, have they no Lawgivers in the Valley? Why be they not at  the Festival?  The Red Hour has already struck.  Do you say that Landru is not everywhere?  She is in festival, as you should be.  The Lawgivers should know.  You mock them! You mock the Lawgivers. And the strangers are not  of the Body. You will see.  He is the one. He mocked the Lawgivers. I heard him.  The others, they were here, but they scorned the Festival. I saw  it.  There, you see? Not of the body.  Landru.  (Hacom leaves quickly)
