(a very old man with a gentle way of speaking) Keep always in  your mind, Flavius, that our way is peace.  Oh? Are you Children of the Sun?  Then are you slaves like ourselves?  No.  Tell me the empire has a device like that, Flavius, and you  may kill them. Otherwise, accept them as friends.  (Septimus leads the way into the caves.) Captain's log, stardate 4040.7. On the surface of  planet four, system eight nine two, the landing party has won the  confidence of what obviously is a group of runaway slaves. They dwell  in caves not far from a large city, wear rags, live under primitive  conditions. But they are creatures of a heavily industrialised  twentieth-century type planet very much like Earth. An amazing example  of Hodgkins's law of Parallel Planet Development. But on this Earth,  Rome never fell. A world ruled by emperors who can trace their line  back two thousand years to their own Julius and Augustus Caesars. [Cave] (The landing party are given water, and Spock leafs  through some magazines.)  No, Captain. I'm sure I would have heard of the arrival of  other men like you.  There are no other worlds.  Lights shining through from heaven. It is where the sun is.  Blessed be the sun.  Taken from the names of false gods. When I was a senator, I  worshiped them too, but I heard the words of the sun. I became a  Brother. For that, they made me a slave.  My advice to you is to leave. Go back where you came from.  Merikus?  Merikus is first citizen. Butcher.  Perhaps five years.  First I must discuss it with the others.  (The men leave.)  We have decided. Flavius will guide you. We will provide you  with suitable clothing. I caution you, take great care. The police are  everywhere. May the blessings of the sun be upon you.  [Countryside] (Dressed as slaves in jeans and t-shirts, the  landing party are lead towards the city. Spock wears his obligatory  woollen hat. They stop by a small thicket of trees.)
