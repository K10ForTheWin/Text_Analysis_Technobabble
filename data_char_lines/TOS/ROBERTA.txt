Hello? Anybody here? Looks like your lucky day, Roberta. They  can't dock you if they don't know you're late.  (Seven comes in from the main room.)  Oh, the subway got stalled  Now, wait a minute. Why should I tell you? Who are you,  anyway?  With three four eight?  Listen, friend, maybe I'd just better call the police right  now.  Who do you think you are?  Okay, I will.  Report.  Oh. Everything I've done?  Well, okay. (puts a sheet of paper in it.) Well, let's see.  Well, how do you expect me to type, with my nose? Did you see  that? The machine typed everything I. It's typing everything I'm  saying! Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! (He turns it off.) Okay. That does  it. I quit!  I'm quitting right now!  Acting? I'm leaving. Goodbye. (Seven locks the door remotely  with his pen.) Hey. Hey!  (Seven activates a green cube on the desk.)  Hey.  Hey, watch it! Okay, I'll bite. What is it?  Research for a new encyclopaedia? No? No.  Sure, I care. What do you think I am?  Oh. Well, what are you guys around here, anyway? FBI? Some  kind of government agents, huh? (The cat enters as he hands her one of  his new IDs) CIA. Very groovy.  Yeah?  Okay.  [Street] (Outside the apartment building.)  I don't know what you're talking about. Listen, you guys can't  come in here.  You can't come in here. Now, get out. What do you think  you're doing? This is a government office.  (Seven picks up Isis and leaves.)  [Apartment - office] Neither one of you can come in here.  This is against the rules.  What do you think you're doing? You want me to (picks up the  telephone) Send the police. Eight Eleven East Sixty Eighth Street,  apartment twelve B.  No, get your hands off of me, you big jerk! Who do you  think you are? Let go! [Apartment - office] (There's a physical tussle going on between Kirk  and Roberta.)  What do you think you're doing, you big jerk? What's the big  idea? [Apartment - main room] Mister Seven, help! Help! [Apartment - office] (Spock takes over from Kirk in manhandling  Roberta.)  Let go of me! Stop it! Don't go in there! What's the big idea?  Get your hands off of me! I mean it!  (She pulls off his hat and sees his ears and eyebrows.) What are you?  (Kirk blasts open the connecting door as Seven dematerialises and the  safe shuts itself.) [McKinley Rocket Base] (Carrying Isis, Seven walks out of Assembly Area  B-10 hangar - warning, liquid hydrogen - into the early morning  sunshine. Or late afternoon. The shadows are fairly long.  I'm warning you, I've already called the police.  In there! [Apartment - main room] All right, don't answer, but you can tell him I quit. You can  tell him I promise not to tell anybody anything. He's safe, and you're  safe, my little green friend. (the box flashes twice) Same to you.  (She sits on the desk and accidentally knocks the 'desk pen' that  controls the safe door. Intrigued, she investigates.) [McKinley Rocket Base] (A crowd is gathering a few miles away to watch the  launch.)  No!  [Transporter room] I'm sorry. I just touched that button right there and then  wow!  Oh, my gosh!  Captain's log, supplemental. Spock and I in  custody. Even if we talked, they wouldn't believe us. We're powerless  to stop Mister Seven or prevent the launch, or even be certain if we  should. I have never felt so helpless.  [Apartment - main room] Look, hey, I mean, not even the CIA could do all this. [Launch Control] Look, I'm sorry, but like you asked me, I do care about my  country, and you can't be CIA.  (She takes his pen from his pocket.)  Hold it!  Hold it, Mister Seven. I'm telling you, you're through  monkeying around with my country's rocket.  Hold it! Don't move! You did enough already!  Mister Seven, I want to believe you. I do. I know this world  needs help. That's why some of my generation are kind of crazy and  rebels, you know. We wonder if we're going to be alive when we're  thirty.  Oh, no.  (pointing the pen at Kirk) Listen you, get away from him.  Please. He's telling the truth.  Would you mind telling me who that is?  Your cat?  (She's a cat again, who decides to scratch behind her own ear.)
