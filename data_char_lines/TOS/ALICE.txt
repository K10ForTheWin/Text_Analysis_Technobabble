Excuse me, sir. Have you seen a rather large white rabbit with a  yellow waistcoat and white gloves here about?  (Wordlessly, McCoy points in the direction the rabbit went. The girl  curtseys nicely)  Thank you very much.  (She runs off after the rabbit) 
This way, please.  The last one, lord.  (She throws Scott into the group.)
