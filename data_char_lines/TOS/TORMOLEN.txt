Right, sir. All life systems were off, sir.  Right, sir.  Well, better look for yourself, Mister Spock. One man was  taking a shower fully clothed. (they split up, he takes off his glove  to scratch his nose then puts it on the console. Something orange jumps  onto his skin. Feeling the cold he puts the glove back on)  Terrible, Captain. It was terrible. They were just sitting,  like they didn't care. Whatever was happening, they didn't care. I keep  wondering  Six dead. Six people dead.  Yes, sir.  Get off me! You don't rank me and you don't have pointed  ears, so just get off my neck!  Nothing!  We're all a bunch of hypocrites. Sticking our noses into  something that we've got no business. What are we doing out here,  anyway?  We bring pain and trouble with us, leave men and women stuck  out on freezing planets until they die. What are we doing out here in  space? Good? What good? We're polluting it, destroying it. We've got no  business being out here. No business.  If a man was supposed to fly, he'd have wings. If he was  supposed to be out in space, he wouldn't need air to breathe, wouldn't  need life-support systems to keep him from freezing to death.  We don't belong here. It's not ours. Not ours. Destroying and  watching. We don't belong. I don't belong. Six people died down there.  Why do I deserve to live?  Let go!  Let me go.
