Bluejay 4, this is Blackjack. We're  tracking you and the UFO.  Bluejay 4, you should be close enough for visual contact.  We have two flights scrambled and on the way. They should  rendezvous in your sector in two minutes.  Bluejay 4, you are ordered to close on  the UFO. and attempt to force him to land. We want it brought down or  at least disabled until the other planes arrive.  You should be close enough for a visual  contact.  (Captain Christopher is beamed into himself. He has a look around, but  Enterprise  has vanished.)  Bluejay Four. Can you see it? What is it? Bluejay 4. Come in.  We've lost the image.  We don't track mirages. [Bridge]
