Spock, it is I.  Spock, parted from me and never parted, never  and always touching and touched. I await you.  Kal-if-fee!  I am prepared.  As it was in the dawn of our days, as it is today, as it will  be for all tomorrows, I make my choice. This one.  (She steps past the expectant Stonn and points at Kirk.)  Specify.  Stonn wanted me, I wanted him.  You have become much known among our people, Spock. Almost a  legend. And as the years went by, I came to know that I did not want to  be the consort of a legend. But by the laws of our people, I could only  divorce you by the kal-if-fee. There was also Stonn, who wanted very  much to be my  consort, and I wanted him. If your Captain were victor, he would not  want me, and so I would have Stonn. If you were victor you would free  me because I had dared to challenge, and again I would have Stonn. But  if you did not free me, it would be the same. For you would be gone,  and I would have your name and your property, and Stonn would still be  there.  I am honoured.
