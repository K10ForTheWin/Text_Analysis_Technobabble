Then learn what it means to be our enemy before you learn what  it means to be our friend.  (The away team are lit up as if by electricity. They collapse,  unconscious.) [Room] (They wake up in a nicely furnished room. McCoy and  Spock are lying down, Kirk slumped over a table.)  Speak.  Yes, Natira.  It is so written.  Does he agree to this?  He must become one of the people, worship the creators, and  agree to the insertion of the Instrument of Obedience.  If he agrees to all things, it is permitted. Teach him our laws  carefully so he commits no sacrilege, no offence against the people or  the creators.  Who are the intruders?  McCoy is not with them?  Kirk and Spock have committed sacrilege. You know what must be  done.  To become one of the people of Yonada, the Instrument of  Obedience must be made part of your flesh. Do you now give your  consent?  Proceed.  Teach him, then, what he must know as one of the people.  (Natira takes McCoy to the obelisk that Kirk and Spock were looking at  when they got caught. She touches three of the planets and it opens to  reveal a white-covered book.)  You have listened to the words of the  non-believers.  That was the first transgression. You felt the pain of warning?    Why did you listen further?  Their truth.  The truth of Yonada is your truth. There can be no other for  you. Repent your disobedience.  It is sacrilege to the temple.  You are not believers. You are forbidden to gaze at the book.  It is blasphemy. You are forbidden. The punishment is death.  (A strong wind blows, and some of the panels on the wall glow deep red.  The air shimmers in the heat.)
