There's a Troyian here. I must know that all is secure before  the Dohlman is brought on board.  Do honour to the Dohlman of Elas.  (Petri kneels)  Glory to Elaan, Dohlman of Elas.  (A woman in little more than a high-necked bathing suit is beamed  aboard. She is beautiful, but slightly sullen. The Enterprise officers  kneel.)  You may stand.  Permission to speak was not given.  He came in answer to your summons.  Her Glory has not summoned you.  (Elaan comes out of her room)  Captain, you must know I will tell you nothing. Our  interrogation techniques are more excruciating than you are even  capable of.
