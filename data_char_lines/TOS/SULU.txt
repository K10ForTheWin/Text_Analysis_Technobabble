Scanners are blank, Captain. We're getting a mass of readings  I've never seen. Nothing makes sense.  (Kirk switches on Spock's science computer)  Yes, sir.  Aye, aye, sir. Yes, Captain?  Totally inoperative, sir. No readings at all.  Yes, sir. No change.  But Captain, two degrees means they'll be overlooking more than a  dozen terrestrial miles on each search loop.  Yes, sir.  Captain, course set for Makus Three.  Space normal, sir?  Captain, there's something there on screen, at Taurus Two.  (On the viewscreen, a long trail of yellow crosses the green of the  planet)  No. It's holding a lateral line. There it is again. Holding  steady, Captain.  Whatever it was, Captain, it just burned up in the atmosphere.  Aye, aye, sir. Warp factor one.  (later, everyone is back on duty) 
Beautiful, beautiful. No animals, no people,  no worries. Just what the doctor ordered. Right, Doctor?  Do you think the Captain will authorise shore leave here?  He'd like it.  To get some cell-structure records. A blade of grass, a bush, a  tree, a flower petal. With these, we can tell the whole planet's  biology.  (As Sulu crouches down behind some pampas grass, McCoy turns and looks  straight at a white rabbit in a check jacket, yellow waistcoat, and  looking at a gold pocket-watch.)  What is it? What's the matter?  See what? I don't see anything. What is it, Doc? [Kirk's quarters] (The Captain is dictating his log in the presence  of Yeoman Tonia Barrows)  Target shooting, Captain. Isn't it a beauty? Haven't got anything  like this in my collection.  I found it. I know it's a crazy coincidence, but I've always  wanted one like this. Found it lying right over there. An old-time  police special, and in beautiful condition. Hasn't been one like this  made in a couple of centuries.  (handing it over) It fires lead pellets propelled by expanding  gases from a chemical explosion.  Captain, take cover! There's a Samurai after me.  I mean, there was. (no one is chasing him now) Captain, you've  got to believe me.  Got a call a few minutes ago. Rodriguez. Said you were  rendezvousing back at the glade.  That's not all. So's my phaser.  Yes, sir. (sound of a transporter beam) Look. Someone beaming  down from the bridge.  We're stranded down here, Captain?  (at the knight's body) Captain! Captain!  (Kirk goes over)  You'd better have a look at this, sir. (the knight is a plastic  dummy) I don't understand.  It's like a dummy, Captain. It couldn't be alive.  Still operating, sir.  Captain!  He's gone. Dragged off.  Sir.  Play? As advanced as you obviously are, and you still play? 
Forty degrees.  (He reaches for the switch, and sways as if dizzy, then stands up and  vanishes)  Where are we?  Is he kidding?  Captain, where could he possibly come from? Who is this maniac?  You mean, it shows he's dead?  No.  We haven't even got our phasers.  Captain, how far do we go along with this charade?  Laid in, sir.  Standing by to warp, sir.  Captain, we're about to warp.  No, sir. All instruments show on course.  Turning, Captain. Nut not veering off from it.  Turn completed, and still accelerating toward the planet.  Warping down, Captain. Our warp factor four. 
What is it, Captain?  We can't beam you up. I've just rigged  up defensive screens.  We could drop screens.  No, sir. Doesn't correspond with any configuration we're  familiar with. [Bridge] Captain, the alien's withdrawing. She's at extreme range,  but our sensors indicate she just activated her transporters.  Sulu here, sir.  Affirmative, sir.  Affirmative, sir. 
Astro sciences standing by, Captain.  If you want the mathematics of this, Mitchell's ability is  increasing geometrically. That is, like having a penny, doubling it  every day. In a month, you'll be a millionaire. 
Yes, sir. Helm answering. She's sluggish, sir.  Picking up, sir, but she's still slow in responding. [Jet fighter] Me, too. If this one's like those, it'll make the devil's noise  if you start it.  I didn't hear anything.  The emergency signal.  Five thirty in that time zone, maybe a little after.  Yes, sir. [Photo lab] (Kirk walks out into the main lab just as security  walk in. He shuts the door behind him and fights the three men, making  lots of noise so Sulu can hear what is going on. He's eventually  restrained, and the Colonel takes a look in the dark room. It's empty.)    Shall I issue phasers?  Yes, sir. (leaves)  Mister Spock ran them through. They were the right ones. We got  them all.  (Spock goes into the Colonel's office)  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Captain's Log, Stardate 3114.1. We must make an  attempt to break free of this time, or we and our reluctant passengers  will remain its prisoners. All we have is a theory and a few facts.  [Briefing room] Warp factor three, sir.  Sir, our speed is increasing. We're travelling at over warp  eight.  It's maximum now, sir. She's fighting it.  (Then everyone's thrown forward)  Gaining speed now, Captain. We're now at warp four, warp seven.  Eight. Off the dial, sir.  Past Pluto, sir.  Engines cutting back, sir. No decrease in speed.  The engines! [Engineering]
Come in. 
Is it possible that they're not?  Whatever doesn't look right, whatever that is. When it comes to  farms, I wouldn't know what looked right or wrong if it were two feet  from me.  (You mean like that weird alien plant right next to you?)  What is it?  Come to think of it, we haven't seen any animals. No horses, no  pigs, not even a dog. Nothing. [Farmhouse] Captain, we've checked out everything. It all seems normal,  except for the absence of any animals.  We haven't seen them since we began our check.  Yes, sir.  Yes, I see now. Of course we can't remove the colony. It'd be  wrong.  Sorry, DeSalle.  I said I was sorry.  If you hadn't gotten in my way  (They fight with their spades.)  (Elsewhere around the settlement, fights are breaking out.) 
Every control on our ship became too hot  to handle.  (Then it all goes dark, and he can touch the consoles again)  Our power's gone. Our phaser banks are dead. 
We're holding orbit, sir. The helm is sluggish. 
Captain, we're picking up a ship on our sensors, heading directly  into the Denevan sun. He'll burn up.  He's too close, Captain.  He burned up, Captain.  Aye, sir.  Aye, aye, sir.  Completing the seeding orbit, Captain. Two  hundred and ten ultraviolet satellites now in position. Seventy two  miles altitude, permanent orbit about the planet.  Ready, Captain.  Warp factor one, sir. <Back  to the episode listing Star  Trek ® is copyright of  CBS  Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Steady. No, Mister Scott, bearing three ten mark thirty five just  cleared. No antimatter residue.  Bearing two ten mark forty. Strong particle concentration. We're  on it, Mister Scott.  Course laid in, sir. Particle density decreasing. Gone, sir. No  readings.  Approaching what seems to be an asteroid  belt, sir. Scanners report approximately seven thousand bodies of  sizes running from types A to N.  Approximately thirty four percent of the bodies of atmospherian  types H to M.  Course two twenty four mark twelve. ETA fifty seven minutes. 
Bridge, Helm, sir. 
Captain?  Not unless I am, too. Captain, that thing's a giant hand.  Hard about. We can't seem to get away from it.  All engines reverse.  (Everyone is thrown forward as the ship is grabbed by the hand and  stopped in its tracks.)  We're dead still, Captain. Helm doesn't answer. We can't move.  Captain's log, stardate 3468.1. While approaching  Pollux Four, a planet in the Beta Geminorum system, the Enterprise has  been stopped in space by an unknown force of some kind.  [Bridge] Aye, aye, sir.  Applying thrust, sir. No results, Captain. We're stuck tight.  Aye, aye, sir. Standing by.  Ineffective, Captain. There doesn't seem to be anything to push  against.  Working, sir.  Computed and standing by to generate, sir.  No good, Mister Spock. We didn't even faze it. We're still locked  tight.  Mister Spock, here's something. There seems to be a radiated  energy pulsation coming from the planet. I don't know what it is, sir.  I can't seem to pinpoint it.  The whole planet, sir? Yes, sir. The whole planet. [Water's side] (At a marble bench by a tranquil water scene.)  Sectors one through twenty five charted and examined. No chance  at all of power originating in those areas.  Aye, sir. Fourteen B by twenty six index.  All phaser banks, fire! [Temple] (The white marble starts to glow pink under the  phaser beams, and Apollo runs back.)  All phaser banks, maintain firing rate!  Maintaining, sir. [Temple]
Yes, Captain?  Aye, sir. 
Thirty.  Nine, eight  [Jefferies tube] Seven.  Six. [Constellation Auxiliary Control] Five, four  (We see the Constellation enter the planet-killer. We see Kyle  frantically to beam something in. We see a cloud coming out of the  planet-killer before there's a bang.)  [Transporter room]
Captain, the life-support system override  jammed.  Aye, sir.  This is the first time I heard a malfunction threaten us.  Aye, sir.  (Kirk crouches down by Spock under the life-support station.)  What's going on, Captain?  Captain? (gets his injection, and grins) Who ever he is, he sure  talks gloomy.  With an armful of this stuff, I wouldn't be afraid of a  supernova.  I wonder who it is we're not supposed to be afraid of. [Briefing room] (McCoy is in the process of inoculating the group.  Scott feels no pain, that's for sure.) 
Captain, shields just snapped on. Something heading in at  multiwarp speeds.  It's going to hit.  (Everyone gets thrown around a lot, and the lights go out for a short  while.)  Aye, sir.  We're losing power, sir.  Photon torpedoes armed, sir.  Ready, sir.  Torpedo away. (a pause, then a flash) Direct hit.  Sir, they've fired another. 
Yes, Mister Spock.  It's not hard to guess the nature of  your order from Starfleet Command. I suggest a connection. The captain  suspects. [Bridge]
There he is, sir. Centre screen. Still trying  to run away from us, sir.  No, sir.  Changing course again. He knows we're after him all right.  He's seen the asteroids too, sir.  If one hits him.  He's drifting into the asteroid belt, Captain.  We're overloading, Captain. Engine temperatures climbing.  That was one of our lithium crystal circuits, sir.  Another lithium circuit. Now supplementing  with battery power, sir.  Asteroid hit him dead centre. [Transporter room] You're on duty, Johnny-o. Back to reality.  I noticed. How I noticed. Come on, Johnny.  Captain Kirk, engineering section reports our entire life-support  system is now on batteries.  Power curve still dropping, Captain.  Checking, but not getting much.  That's Ben Childress' quarters.  Engines engaged. Helm answering.  Ahead full, sir. <Back  to the episode listing Star  Trek ® is copyright of  CBS  Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Standard orbit, Captain.  You already gave that command, sir.  You'll live.  Maintaining standard orbit, Captain.  (Kirk enters.)  Aye, aye, sir.  You mean another twenty thousand, Captain?  Orbiting at twenty thousand, sir.  Maintaining, sir.  [Biochemistry lab] Two years, sir.  No, sir.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir. Captain Kirk repeated his order.  Across the Neutral Zone?  Entering Romulan Neutral Zone, sir. All  sensors on maximum.  Romulans approaching from both sides. We're bracketed, sir.  Lieutenant Uhura is right, sir. We've tangled with them before.  [Sickbay] Sir, they've fired another. [Sickbay] (As the Enterprise continues to be battered, Kirk  is writhing and groaning.)  They know they have us. They know our shields will give out.  We're losing power, sir.  We're surrounded by Romulan vessels. Maximum of ten. Range fifty  to a hundred thousand kilometres.  Standing by, sir.  Yes, sir. And out of the Neutral Zone.  Two five seven degrees, mark three.  Steady as she goes, Captain. 
There's an unplanned course change being fed into the  instruments, sir.  I can't, sir.  Sir, auxiliary control is on total override.  Turning on three oh seven degrees, mark eight. Being executed  now, sir.  [Auxiliary Control] (The three burly security men arrive.)  Sir, the instruments won't respond.  Sir, we're picking up speed. Warp five, six. Warp seven, sir.  I can't, sir. All the controls are jammed. 
call it balmy.  Rice wine will do, if you're short on coffee.  Hot line direct to the Captain. Are we that far gone?  Per your training programme, Mister Spock.  [Sickbay] (other Kirk is screaming)  Can't see clearly, Doctor, to read top  indicator. Think the cold penetrating communicator. Two men  unconscious. No time. No. Can't wait. No time. 
Planet dead ahead, Captain. Becoming visual.  (There's a yellow and gold planet on the viewscreen.)  All power gone, sir.  All normal. No damage at all. 
Lieutenant Sulu here, sir.  Helm to Captain Kirk. 
Our whole medical staff will volunteer  to beam down  Repeat your message. Come in, landing party. Repeat your  message.  I understand, sir. When he regains consciousness, assure him  that we have no problems here.  Without verification. 
Computers indicate an impact somewhere in the heart of the  Euro-Asian continent. 
Impulse drive, Captain?  Aye, aye, sir.  Lost contact now.  Captain! Distant bearing, sir, mark seven three point five.  Phasers ready, sir.  Laid in, Captain.  Aye, sir. One hundred thousand kilometres. Ninety. Eighty.  Sixty.  Fifty.  She's passed us without firing a shot.  Captain, the Klingon ship is closing on an intercept course. Five  hundred thousand kilometres. Deflector shields up.  Three hundred thousand kilometres.  One hundred thousand kilometres.  (Weapons fire hits the Enterprise)  Here he comes again, sir.  Sorry, Captain. She won't respond fast enough on impulse.  He's paralleling us again. He seems to have broken off the  attack.  He's coming in again, sir.  Aye, sir.  Shields holding, but weakened, sir.  Captain, number four shield just collapsed. Impulse power down to  thirty one percent.  Captain, he's starting his run.  Aye, sir.  Warp power to the shields, Captain?  Aye, sir.  One hundred thousand kilometres.  Seventy five. Seventy. Sixty. Fifty.  Forty.  Thirty.  Direct hit amidships by photon torpedo.  Aye, aye, sir.  [Transporter room] (Kirk is already there when Petri and Elaan enter,  her bodyguards trailing behind) 
Phaser two firing.  Tracking report, sir. Sixty five minutes to end of safety  margin. 
Maintaining course and speed, sir.  But, sir, that'll lead us directly into the Romulan Neutral Zone.    Aye, sir.  Captain, leaving Neutral Zone. Now entering Romulan space.  (Scott enters the Bridge.)  Captain!  Aye, sir.  Holding at warp nine, sir.  Three one eight mark seven, sir. Executing.  (They cut underneath the Romulan ship.) 
Casualty, Captain. Barnhart was found dead on deck nine.  Same symptoms.  Bridge. Sulu.  GQ security three, sir. [Corridor]   General quarters three. Intruder alert. GQ three. Intruder  Bridge to Captain. Sulu here.  Affirmative, Captain.  General quarters four, Captain.  Deck five, section three. Deck five, section three. Report. 
Maintaining standard orbit, Captain.  Hi there.  (blissfully unaware of reality) The planet Triacus.  With all respects, Captain, you're wrong. I have Triacus on my  screen now.  (And all five children standing near him.) [Transporter room] Yes, sir.  Captain, stay away from the controls! If you touch them, we'll be  destroyed.  Marcos Twelve dead ahead, sir.  Aye, sir.  (McCoy leads the children off the bridge.)  Course reversed, Captain.  Yes, sir. <Back  to the episode listing Star Trek ® and related  marks are trademarks of CBS Studios Inc.

Phaser banks standing by, sir.  What happened?  No change from last reading, sir.  I've got it again. An ion trail matching when  we first saw her.  Warp six.  No mistake, sir.  Captain's log, stardate 5431.4. for fifteen hours  and twenty minutes we have been following the ion trail of the  spaceship that has Spock's brain. Time left to us, eight hours and  forty minutes. [Bridge] Captain, I've lost the trail.  It's gone, sir. A sudden deaction shift.  But that ship, Captain, either it was many years ahead of us or  the most incredible design fluke in history.  But a technological rating of only three. They couldn't possibly  have put that ship we saw into space.  I say planet four, Captain. At least planet four is ahead of  three technologically.  A hunch, Captain? 
Warp factor two, sir. [Ambassador's quarters] (Spock removes the anti-gravity handle.)  I don't believe this myself, Captain, but we're travelling at  warp factor eight point five.  Warp factor nine and accelerating.  Aye, sir.  Captain. 
Aye, sir. Readings now indicate two point seven two one on the  Ritter scale. At the present rate of decrease, we'll have to wait at  least seventeen hours more before we can even attempt to enter orbit.  The storm's already lasted four hours longer than we've  anticipated. Do you suppose our landing party could be in any danger?  Aye, aye, sir. Warp factor two. <Back  to the episode listing Star Trek ® and related  marks are trademarks of CBS Studios Inc.

Aye, aye, sir.  Just within transporter range, sir.  I can't get an accurate fix on the Defiant, Mister Scott, but I  know it's drifting away from us. Shall I correct for range, sir?  Mister Scott, the Defiant. It's starting to disappear. [Transporter room] Aye, aye, sir.  [Defiant Bridge] I think he had several spasms of pain.  Mister Spock. A vessel approaching on an intercept vector.  Range two hundred thousand kilometres. Velocity zero point five  one C.  (An arrow-head shaped ship has arrived.)  They've stopped dead, sir. Range ninety thousand kilometres and  holding.  Sensor readings are not corresponding to those we received the  last time we saw the Defiant.  Mister Spock, we're being fired upon.  (The ship shakes to the impact of the blasts of energy.)  But sir, that'll reduce our phaser power by fifty percent.  Phasers locked in, sir.  Ready, Mister Spock.  A hit, Mister Spock.  Mister Spock, something has just entered sensor range. It's  another Tholian, sir. Loskene must've contacted them when he tried to  intercept us.  Shall I lock in remaining phaser power, sir?  Just beyond phaser range, sir.  Yes, sir.  (Five horizontal lines on the viewscreen.)  Mister Spock, they're closing the web.  It's the Captain. Sir, the tractor field is activating.  I can't, sir.  Warp factor two, sir. <Back  to the episode listing Star Trek ® and related  marks are trademarks of CBS Studios Inc.  Copyright © 1966, Present. The Star Trek web pages on this site are for  educational and entertainment purposes only. All other copyrights 
Yes, sir.  (Kirk enters.)  Aye, sir.  Phasers one and two locked in and ready.  Warp factor three, sir.  [McCoy's office]
No good, Captain. [Jefferies tube]
Captain, there's some trouble on the hangar deck. The controls  are frozen.  Yes, sir.  Sir, now I have readings that deflectors are inoperative. The  controls are frozen.  That's just what happened. He was there, then all of a sudden he  wasn't there.  [Corridor] Yes.  Somebody's repairing every console on the  ship.  Aye, sir. 
What kind of earthquakes do they have in this  place?  It's gone! The Enterprise, it's gone!  (Sulu hands over his tricorder.)  The Enterprise must have blown up. That would explain the high  radiation readings, wouldn't it, Captain? If the matter - antimatter  engines  Once in Siberia there was a meteor so great that it flattened  whole forests and  was felt as far away as  Aye, sir.  Yes, Captain. All vegetation is inedible. Poison to us.  Aye, sir.  Sulu to Captain.  Captain, I was making a standard magnetic sweep. From zero, I  suddenly got a reading that was off the scale. Then, a reverse of  polarity and now I get nothing. I've never seen anything like this  reading. Like a door opened and then closed again.  Poor D'Amato. What a terrible way to die.  That's the same red rock.  Yes, sir.  It looks so lonely there.  Doctor, how can you joke about it?  You remember on Janus Six, the silicon creatures  Beings intelligent enough to have destroyed the Enterprise?  The basic substance of this planet is an alloy of  diburnium-osmium. It couldn't have evolved naturally.  But Captain, where are the people who made it? Why can't we see  them?  I'll take the first watch, sir.  Aye, sir.  (Sulu sets up the tricorder on a rock ledge, and leaves it beeping away  to itself.)  [Bridge] Who are you?  How do you know this? Where did you get this information? Are you  from this planet?  Then the planet is hollow. Who killed Lieutenant D'Amato? All  right. The captain will want to talk to you. That way. Move!  What do you want?  You were on the Enterprise. Keep back! Stop or I'll shoot! I  don't want to have to kill a woman.  (Sulu fires his phaser at her feet, then at her. It has no effect.)  Captain Kirk! Captain Kirk!  (As he backs away, Sulu falls over a stone. Losira manages to brush his  shoulder before he gets away, screaming in pain, and Kirk steps in  front of her.)  Don't let her touch you, Captain! That's how D'Amato died.  Phasers won't stop her.  How can such people be, Captain? Such evil and she's so, so  beautiful.  She just touched me. How could it happen so fast?  Captain, I'm happy the way it turned out.  I feel fine, Captain.  But Captain, how does she know about us? Does she read our minds?  (there's a whining sound) Phaser on overload!  Captain, I'm getting that strange magnetic  sweep again, from zero to off the scale.  She must be somewhere.  I'd rather be on the Enterprise, sir.  It's a very painful affair. I can tell you.  Captain, we can no longer protect each other.  (Spock and a security guard beam in.) 
Foil. It's a rapier. A thin sword.  What do you mean, what do you do with it?  You practice.  Hi, Joey.  Your attitude is all wrong. Fencing tones the muscle, sharpens  the eye, improves the posture. You tell him, Joey.  Explain to him. Hey, Joey. You feeling all right?  What's with him?  You sure you're all right now, Joe? We've got to leave.  Take it easy, Joe.  Now calm down.  You're all steamed up, Joe.  What are you doing, Joe?  Joey, don't be a fool.  Magnetic field continuing to shift, sir. Planet continuing to  shrink in mass.  Helm answering nicely, Captain.  Relative gravity increase, sir. Like the planet reached out and  yanked at us.  Don't know if it's this planet or what happened with Joe. I'm  sweating like a bridegroom.  Hey, why don't you come down to the gym with me, Kevin m'lad?  Why not? Light workout will take the edge off.  (brandishing foil) Richelieu, beware! Stand.  No farther. No escape for you. You either leave this bois bloodied, or  with my blood on your swords. Cowards!  [Bridge] Richelieu, at last.  For honour, Queen, and France! (lunges)  Ah.  I'll protect you, fair maiden.  Foul Richelieu. (distracted by Uhura's escape, Kirk is able to  grab Sulu and Spock does a neck-pinch)  (waking up screaming) I was on the Bridge.  Hey Doc, what am I doing here?  Doc, will you let me out of here? I'm all right.  Course laid in, sir.  [Engineering] Captain, my velocity gauge is off the scale.  My chronometer's running backwards, sir.  Helm answering, sir. Power reversing.  Warp one, sir.  Course laid in, sir. 
Hangar doors open and clearing for entrance of shuttlecraft.  Shuttlecraft approaching hangar deck. [Turbolift] Bridge to Captain Kirk.  Hangar doors closed, and hangar deck is pressurising. 
We can't beam anybody down, sir. The force field on the planet is  in full operation, and all forms of transport into the asylum dome are  blocked off.  The force field is weakest on the far side of the planet. We can  send down a shuttlecraft carrying a team in environmental suits.  There's been an explosion on Elba Two!  Yes, sir. Solidly.  On the far side of the planet, Mister Scott.  Yes, sir.  Orbital co-ordinates released, sir.  Course one four mark six eight. Synchronous orbit re-established,  sir.  Ship's phasers ready, sir.  Force field still holding, sir. [Control room]
But, sir, that could take years.  Aye, sir.  [Corridor] (Kirk is checking each room when he sees a young  woman walking backwards from a junction, arms outstretched as she  almost dances.)  With the captain lost, sir, that's the best they could come up  with? 
I don't think he's even noticed she has a brain.  Captain, I'm picking up a high intensity reading.  No, sir.  (There's a bright thing in the middle of the viewscreen.) An engineer  touches Scott's arm to attract his attention.)  Captain, it's approaching at warp factor two point six and  accelerating.  Shields activated, Captain.  (The bright thing 'invades' the ship with sparkles. Only Mira does not  shield her eyes from it. Then the sparkles withdraw.)  No, it was speech that was affected. I couldn't utter a sound.  Captain, I've plotted the storm's path.  On its present course, it will hit Memory Alpha planetoid as it  did us.  It is already over Memory Alpha, Captain! Its speed is  incredible. It's hitting the planetoid.  It is leaving Memory Alpha, Captain.  Enterprise to Captain Kirk. [Memory Alpha] Captain, it's changing course.  Captain, it's heading straight for us.  Shields activated.  One four three mark three.  Evasive action.  Two one seven mark five. Still with us, sir.  One one seven mark two. Still with us, sir!  Captain, change in velocity recorded. They are passing our  starboard side and  manoeuvreing in front of us. Switching to forward scanner. Captain,  change in velocity recorded. It has accelerated its approach. [Engineering] Locked in, sir.  None, sir. They're still approaching us.  Locked in, sir.  The phasers seem to have stopped their  approach. They're holding position.  Locked in, sir.  Ready for firing, Captain.  Bridge to Captain Kirk. [Briefing room] Attention. All personnel, attention. Alien  force has penetrated the ship. [Corridor]
Sulu here, Captain. What happened to us? I heard a whistle,  and then 
Is that you, Captain? Are you all right? 
Warp factor two, sir.  Aye, sir. Three seven three mark eight.  Aye, sir.  Sulu here, Captain. Starfleet Command is requesting additional  details on the delay.  The death penalty is forbidden. There's only one exception.  The captain really must be going mad if he  thinks he can get away with an execution.  What difference does it make who he is? Are we going to allow an  execution to take place?  I'll fight them every way and any way I can.  (Kirk enters) 
Alert! Alert! All decks alert! Alert! Alert! Captain to the  Bridge. All decks alert.  All decks, condition red. All decks,  condition red. Captain's Log, stardate 1709.2. Patrolling outposts  guarding the neutral zone between planets Romulus and Remus and the  rest of the galaxy, received emergency call from outpost 4. The U.S.S.
