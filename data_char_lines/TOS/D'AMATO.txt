The opportunity to explore so young a planet is an incredible  bit of luck, Captain.  Captain. Captain!  (There's an earthquake which also shakes the Enterprise.) [Bridge] Captain, this tremor we felt, if that's what it was, it's  certainly like no seismic disturbance I've ever felt before. I got a  reading of almost immeasurable power, but it's not there any more.  The reading I got had nothing to do with a seismic force.  He's right, Captain. There's nothing there.  Yes, sir.  No, sir. And I haven't seen any evidence that there ever has  been any rainfall.  Yes, sir. Could be.  Yes, sir.  I'm not. Geological disturbances don't frighten me. I've come  here to study them. My specialty.  That's right. How did you know that?  Yes, and we're stranded here. You been talking to my friends?  I'm not afraid.  You're, you're the woman on the Enterprise.  Lucky D'Amato. I want to have a conference about sharing your  food and water.
