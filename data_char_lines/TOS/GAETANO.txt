(Holding his right wrist) Yes.  II don't know. It's from up there.  It's everywhere. It's all around us!  It was something huge, terrible. Up there. I think I hit it.  Vaguely. It was like a giant ape.  At least it was quick for him.  I tell you there was.  But there must be something. I swear I hit it.  Mister Spock. In the interest of efficiency, I don't think we  should leave his body here.  We'll do it. Give me a hand with Latimer, will you? Captain's Log, stardate 2822.3. We continue to  search, but I find it more difficult each moment to ward off a sense of  utter futility and great loss. [Bridge] They're getting ready. They'll attack.  Yes, I agree. If we stand by and do nothing, we're just giving  them an invitation to come down and slaughter us.  Well, we're practical about it. I say we hit them before they  hit us.  The majority.  That could get us killed.  Now you're talking.  Oh, for the. You saw what they did to Latimer!  I say we hit them dead on.  I still say we should have killed them.
