Tamar, stand clear.  You attacked the Body. You have heard the Word and disobeyed.  You will be absorbed.  You will be absorbed. The Good is all. Landru is gentle. You  will come.  It is the law. You must come.  It is clear that you simply did not understand. I will  re-phrase. You are ordered to accompany us to the absorption chambers.  Out of order. You will obey. It is the word of Landru.  You cannot. It is Landru.  Come.  Then you will die.  Come.  (Kirk leaves with the Lawgivers.)  With thanks. Happy communing.  (Marplon steps into the control booth.)  [Prison] (Spock is attempting a mind meld on McCoy.)  You. Come. [Absorption Chamber] (Kirk is released and greets Spock with an inane  smile on his face.)  Landru! Guide us, Landru!  (Kirk draws his phaser.)
