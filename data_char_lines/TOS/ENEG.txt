Major.  I've had a full report. You are not from Zeon.  Where do you come from?  What is your business with the Fuhrer?  That's enough, Major. What were the weapons found on you? What  design? Our famous SS laboratories have been unable to discover how the  weapons work.  You've had a few minutes without result. The trouble with you SS  is that you don't realise that punishment becomes ineffective after a  certain point. Men become insensitive.  Lock them up. Let their pain argue with them. Then I will  question them.  Finished? What have you learned? Hold them for an hour.  That is my order, Major. I suggest you do not disobey it.  Search the building.  (Isak gets Daras and takes her out of the room)  [Cloakroom] I see.  You were right to conceal him. There's a spy in this building  with a secret transmitter. We're conducting a search. Hail the Fuhrer.  Guards.  Pass them on my responsibility.  (The guards leave with Spock and Eneg follows.)  Wait, soldier. There's been enough killing. Now we'll start to  live the way the Fuhrer meant us to live. [Broadcast booth] Thank you, but go now. We must do the rest.  It is time to stop the bloodshed, to bury our dead. [Corridor]
