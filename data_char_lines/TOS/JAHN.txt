Miri is with them! Why? Why?  I don't, I don't know. I know what we've got to do. There are  more of them than we see. Somewhere, up in the sky, maybe, somewhere.  They talk to each other all the time. You know Grups. You know what  they do, the hurting, the killing.  That's right, the way it was in the before time. They talk to the  other Grups with these little boxes. Now, if they didn't have those  little boxes, they'd be all alone, huh?  No! It's not a game, it's real. They're dangerous, they're Grups.  Don't you understand?  (sees Kirk and Miri approach the building) All right, let's hide!    (Kirk and Miri come in, then a changing girl appears. The children  flee, screaming. The girl jumps Kirk, and he eventually stuns her)  That would be some foolie, Miri, but do you  think it would work?  But Grups, they know things and all that. You know, I bet they'll  be able to do it with one person less.  No, you got the wrong game. A teacher, I told you. Now, what does  a teacher say, huh?  It's a foolie.  You think I'd tell you? Miri, you're not supposed to be here.  What's the matter, something go wrong?  Okay, then. Don't just stand there in the doorway, come on in.  You listen, Miri.  Tell'em, Jim. Tell'em, Jim.  No yelling in the classroom! Look at him, a very bad citizen.  You're the teacher.  He's funny. He thinks he's funny.  They're Grups!  Is this supposed to be a good thing, Miri?
