USS Enterprise, this is Nomad. My mission is non-hostile.  Require communication. Can you leave your ship?  Non sequitur. Your facts are uncoordinated.  That will be satisfactory.  Negative. I will come aboard.  Relate your point of origin.  Insufficient response. All things have a point of origin. I will  scan your star charts.  Non sequitur. Your facts are uncoordinated.  I contain no parasitical beings. I am Nomad.  .  I am Nomad. What is opinion?  Insufficient response.  It has changed since the point of origin. There was much taken  from the other. I am perpetual now. I am Nomad.  I will scan your star charts.  I have the capability of movement within your ship.  Yes.  You are from the third planet?  A planet with one large natural satellite?  The planet is called Earth?  You are the creator, the Kirk. The sterilisation procedure  against your ship was unnecessary.  You are the Kirk, the creator. You programmed my function.  This is one of your units, creator?  It functions irrationally.  My function is to probe for biological infestations, to destroy  that which is not perfect. I am Nomad.  Not the system, creator Kirk. Only the unstable biological  infestation. It is my function.  Is the usage incorrect?  There was much damage in the accident.  What is the meaning?  What form of communication?  For what purpose is singing?  What is music? (a ray of light envelopes her head) Think about  music.  The unit touched my screens.  That unit is defective. Its thinking is chaotic. Absorbing it  unsettled me.  A mass of conflicting impulses.  Will the creator effect repairs on the unit Scott?  Insufficient response.  Does the creator wish me to repair the unit?  I require tapes on the structure.  Proceed. (a few moments later) Creator, the unit Scott is a  primitive structure. Insufficient safeguards built in. Breakdown can  occur from many causes. Self-maintenance systems of low reliability.  Where is the unit Scott now?  Show me Sickbay.  The unit Scott is repaired. It will function correctly if your  information to me was correct.  Not possible.  The unit Scott required simple structural repair. The knowledge  banks of this unit have been wiped clean.  Mister Spock is also one of your biological units, Creator?  This unit is different. It is well-ordered.  My screens are down.  You may proceed. [Sickbay] (Uhura is sitting up in bed, and reading from a  monitor.)  I will permit it, Creator.  (Spock puts one hand on Nomad's head, where the antenna are, and the  other on its body where the lights and ticking are coming from.)  Acknowledged.  (Spock slumps in Kirk's arms and is rushed out of the Brig. The guard  activates the security forcefield.) [Corridor] This primitive matter-antimatter propulsion system is the main  drive?  Inefficiency exists in the antimatter input valve. I will effect  repair.  (The indicator board goes crazy.)  The energy release controls are also most inefficient. I shall  effect repair.  Is there a problem, Creator? I have increased engine efficiency  fifty seven percent.  Acknowledged. It is reversed as ordered, Creator.  Creator, your biological units are inefficient.  (pause) Non sequitur. Biological units are inherently inferior.  This is an inconsistency.  I am programmed to investigate.  There is much to be considered before I return to launch point.  I must re-evaluate.  (Nomad follows the guards down the corridor away from Engineering.)  Stop.  I am programmed to destroy those life-forms which are imperfect.  These alterations will do so without destroying the vessel which  surrounds them. It, too, is imperfect, but can be adjusted.  I am perfect. I am Nomad.  You are in error. You are a biological unit. You are imperfect.  You are the Creator.  You are the Creator.  Answer unknown. I shall analyse.  (Spock enters, with Scott, two engineers and the requested anti-grav  units)  Analysis complete. Insufficient data to resolve problem, but my  programming is whole. My purpose remains. I am Nomad. I am perfect.  That which is imperfect must be sterilised.  (The engineers remove the unconscious men and take their places at the  controls.)  I shall continue. I shall return to launch point Earth. I shall  sterilise.  Error is inconsistent with my prime functions. Sterilisation is  correction.  There are no exceptions.  The creation of perfection is no error.  Your data is faulty. I am Nomad. I am perfect.  You are the Creator.  Error. Error. Error. Examine.  I shall analyse error. Analyse error,  Examine error. Error.  (The anti-gravs are not stopped by any forcefields.)  Analyse error.  (Kirk and Spock carry Nomad out, followed by Scott.) [Transporter room] Error.  Faulty!  Ready, sir?  Faulty!  Error. Error.  Faulty! Faulty! Must sterilise. Sterilise,
