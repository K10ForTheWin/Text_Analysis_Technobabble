I am your drill thrall. I am called Lars.  That is not your concern. Your drill thralls will attend you  presently. (he opens Uhura's door and goes in) There is little time.  I have been selected for you.  (The shadow play tells all we need to know. And the screams.)  It is not allowed to refuse selection.  (He leaves. Uhura's clothes are intact.)
