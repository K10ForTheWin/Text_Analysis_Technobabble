Who has summoned me?  No, Captain. I command here. My followers are strong and  faithful and obedient. That's why we take what is ours wherever we go.  Then you know I must win, Captain.  Ah, but your strength is cancelled by your gentleness. You are  full of goodness. Such as you cannot be changed. You are like the  parents. You must be eliminated.  I forbid it.  I fear nothing.  They would not help transport us. They were against us. They  had to be eliminated.  You are also too late. The kind ones always are.  You are my future generals. Together we can raise armies of  followers. Go to your posts! The first great victories are upon us. You  will see. We have millions of friends on Marcos Twelve. We shall  exterminate all who oppose us! Our purity of purpose cannot be  contaminated by those who disagree, who will not co-operate, who do not  understand. They must be annihilated.  (But now the children are crying.)  I command you! I command you! To your posts! Carry out your  duties, or I will destroy you! You will be swept aside to make way for  the strong.  Death. Death to you all. Death to you all. Death to you all.  Death to you all.  (Gorgon fades away. Sulu's swords vanish. McCoy enters.)
