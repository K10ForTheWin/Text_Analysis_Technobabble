He knows nothing of our danger. How could he save us?  Elder, words will not save us when the skies darken. We must be  certain. I say he must prove he is a god.  There is no sound in the body. There is no light in the eyes.  He will move no more.  Miramanee. What are you doing?  You should be working on our ritual cloak.  What do you mean? We cannot go against tradition.  But you are promised to me.  Tribal priestess and medicine chief are always joined.  I wish no other.  Miramanee, if you could choose, would you choose me?  (She lowers her eyes and walks away.) [Lodge] (Kirk is carving a hole in a gourd.)  Even though you be a god, Kirok, I cannot permit this Joining.  Then you must strike me dead.  You bleed. You bleed, Kirok. Behold a god who bleeds! Behold a  god who bleeds!  (They fight, and Kirk gets Salish pinned to the ground.)  Kill me. Kill me, Kirok, for I will not rest until I prove to  my people that you are no god.  (Kirk throws down the knife and walks away.)  (In the Earth Lodge, Kirk is dressed in the cloak of many coloured  feathers, and he and Miramanee stand in front of the elder.)  [Spock's quarters] Why are you not at the temple, Kirok? Soon the ground will  begin to tremble. The people need your help.  The caves? Surely a legend can do more than that for his  people.  Well, what do you wait for, god? Your robes?  There's the false one!  (They throw their stones at Kirk.)  He's false!  Then go. Go die with your false god.
