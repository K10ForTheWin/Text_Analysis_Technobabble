The eons have passed and what has been written  has come about. You are most welcome, my beloved children. Your places  await you.  You have left your plains and valleys and made  this bold venture. So it was in the beginning. You have made me proud.  Now you can rest.  We shall remember together. We shall drink the  sacramental wine. There shall be the music of the pipes. The long wait  has ended.  Yes. I caused the wind to withdraw from your  sails.  It has been five thousand years. Have you  learned no patience in that time?  You have the same fire. How like your fathers  you are. Agamemnon, Hector, Odysseus.  You will obey me, lest I close my hand thus.  hat was your first lesson. Remember it. Captain  Kirk, I invite you and your officers to join me. But do not bring that  one, the one with the pointed ears. He is much like Pan, and Pan always  bored me. No sad faces. This is a time to rejoice, not to fear. You are  returning home. Let your hearts prepare to sing.
