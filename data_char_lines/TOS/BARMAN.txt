I don't want any. I told you before, and I'm telling you again  I don't want any more Spican flame gems. Thanks to you,  I have enough Spican flame gems to last me a lifetime.  I use that to polish the flame gems.  Not at your price.  That's what we're trying to decide right now.  One credit apiece.  All right. I'll double my offer 2 credits.  Four credits.  That's my offer.  Five?  You're talking yourself out of a deal, friend. Six credits. Not  a credit more.  Done. When can I have them?  Well, let me see, little lady. Six credits. Figure a reasonable  mark-up for a reasonable profit, say ten percent mark-up. Ten credits.  In fact, I'll sell you this one.  (the tribble is eating grain spilt from the packet Kirk gave Chekov)  That'll be ten credits.  What are you trying to do, ruin the market?  A tribble.  (starts producing tribbles from all over the place and putting  them on the bar) A tribble?  (The pretty lady in yellow brings our group their drinks.) 
Ike, Frank, hiya, boys. I didn't think I'd see you again.  You boys want your usual?  You know we ain't got nothing but bourbon, unless you want corn  whiskey.  (bringing a bottle and glasses.) Close, Ike. Lucky there wasn't  two of them.  Sylvia's right. They've been bad-mouthing something fierce all  over town. You boys watch it.  I ain't making no big claims about you to nobody. Just so  happens.  Yeah?  Ike Clanton. Who do you think you are?  No.  Not exactly.  Sure.  On the Clantons. You Clantons are always great with your jokes.  That's why we like you.  The only difference between you and the Earps is that they  never joke.  It's okay with me, Ike. Anything you say. Don't make no  difference who I think you are. Your problem is, who does Wyatt Earp  think you are? [Marshall's office] (The Marshall is Wyatt Earp, and Morgan is also  there when Kirk walks in.)
