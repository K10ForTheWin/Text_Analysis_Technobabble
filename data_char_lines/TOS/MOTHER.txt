Trelane.  (Two green flashing lights appear, and Trelane steps into their  spotlight)  Time to come in now, Trelane.  If you cannot take proper care of your pets, you cannot have  them at all.  You'll grow up, Trelane. You'll understand. Now come along.  No, Trelane.  (The spotlight contracts, and Trelane gradually vanishes)  You must forgive our child. The fault is ours for indulging him  too much. He will be punished.  Forgive us, Captain. We will maintain your life-support  conditions while you return to your ship. Please accept our apologies.  (The lights disappear)
