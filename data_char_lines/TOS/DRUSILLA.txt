I was told to wait for you and provide wine, food, whatever  you wish. I am Proconsul's slave Drusilla. Although for this evening.  (pause) For this evening I was told I am your slave. Command me.  What will not work?  We're alone. Please believe me. I've never lied to one who  owns me.  [Jail] (Spock is checking the iron bars of their prison.)  I was concerned. I am ordered to please you.  Torture? I do not understand. I do not wish to see you  tortured in any way. (she kisses him) At the first sign of pain, you  will tell me?
