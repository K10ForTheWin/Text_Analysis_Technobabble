I am the teer Akaar. I lead the Ten Tribes of Capella.  (A heavily pregnant woman enters and sits.)  And this is Eleen, a young wife to give an old man a son to rule  these tribes.  If it was your man, wasn't it his privilege to die for you? I do  not understand.  It was the Earth people who first bargained for our rocks.  It is I who speak for the tribe, Maab.  The Earth men have different customs, but never have they lied  to our people.  Do you say you will fight me, Maab?  The sky does not interest me. I must consider the words I have  heard.
