Clanton, I don't know what you're trying to pull, but we warned  you not to show your ugly face in town again.  All right, Clanton. One more chance. Your last. You've got until  five tonight to get your horse-stealing scurvy crew out of town. All  the way.  Draw, Clanton.  You draw or I will.  Five o'clock, Clanton. Is that clear? If you're in town at five  oh one, we'll kill every one of you whether you draw or not. Is that  clear?  [Saloon] (McCoy is tending to Kirk's lip. He flinches from  whatever McCoy has put on the cloth.)  Come on, Clanton. Let's do it now.  Draw.  (Kirk reaches for his gun, and the Earps fire. We see the bullets  splintering the wood behind the landing party. The Earps empty their  guns, then Kirk engages Wyatt in good old-fashioned fisticuffs. He  beats him but chooses not to shoot him. Everything disappears.)  [Bridge] (McCoy is examining Chekov at his station.)
