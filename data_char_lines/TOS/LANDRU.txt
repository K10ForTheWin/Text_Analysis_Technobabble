I am Landru.  You have come as destroyers. You bring an infection.  You have come to a world without hate, without fear, without  conflict. No war, no disease, no crime. None of the ancient evils.  Landru seeks tranquillity. Peace for all. The universal good.  The good must transcend the evil. It shall be done. So it has  been since the beginning.  You will be absorbed. Your individuality will merge into the  unity of the good, and in your submergence into the common being of the  Body,  you will find contentment and fulfillment. You will experience the  absolute good.  Despite my efforts to save you, you have invaded the Body and  you are causing great harm.  Obliteration is necessary. The infection is strong. For the  good of the Body, you must die. It is a great sorrow.  All who saw you, all who know of your presence here must be  excised. The memory of the Body will be cleansed.  I am Landru. You have intruded.  Your devices have been neutralised. So it shall be with you. I  am Landru.  I am Landru. I am he. All that he was, I am. His experience,  his knowledge.  Your statement is irrelevant. You will be obliterated. The good  of the Body is the Prime Directive.  I am Landru.  The good is the harmonious continuation of the Body. The good  is peace, tranquillity. The good of the Body is the directive.  The body is. It exists. It is healthy.  Do you ask a question?  Insufficient data.  (sounding very machine-like, Davros-like) I am not programmed  to answer that question.  Peace, order, and tranquillity are maintained. The body lives,  but I reserve creativity to me.  This is impossible.  But there is evil.  I think. I live.  Landru, help me!  Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me!  (Fire breaks out and things go bang. The machine dies. Now Kirk and  Spock step briefly into the computer room.)
