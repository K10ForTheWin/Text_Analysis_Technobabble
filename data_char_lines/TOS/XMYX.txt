Hello, Captain. You're from the same outfit as the Horizon?    Last month? What are you talking about? The Horizon left  here a hundred years ago.  Toward the edge of what?  Well, there's an intersection just at the end of the block,  near a yellow fire plug. Think you can find it?  (Kirk goes over to the engineering station.)  Fine. Fine. I'll have a reception committee there to meet  you.  Hey, you in the ship.  Again you'll send me down a hundred of  these fancy heaters you've got, and some troops to show me how to use  them.  You understand?  Huh? Hey, how'd you get back up there?  Krako's put the bag on your captain.  He'll scrag him, too.  Then we can talk about the deal I want.    My boys'll spring Kirk, and then we'll  talk about giving me a hand.
