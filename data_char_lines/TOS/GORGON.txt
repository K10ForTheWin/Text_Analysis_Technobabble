(echoy voice) You have done very well, my friends. You have  done what must be done. You have come aboard the Enterprise. Now our  destination is a Federation settlement. Captain Kirk will undoubtedly  choose a closer station. Do not let that deter you. Marcos Twelve has  millions of people on it. Nearly a million will join us as our friends.  The rest will be our enemies.  Together with our other friends who will join us, we will defeat our  enemies as we defeated them on Triacus. A million friends on Marcos  will make us invincible. No one will tell us where to go, when to  sleep, where to eat. The universe will be mine to command, yours to  play in. To accomplish this great mission, we must first control the  Enterprise. To control the ship, we first must control the crew. You  know how to do that. That is your next task. And as you believe, so  shall you do, so shall you do. As you believe, so shall you do, so  shall you do. As you believe, so shall you do, so shall you do. [Bridge] Friends we have reached a moment of crisis. The enemy have  discovered our operation, but they are too late. They no longer control  the ship. We do. We shall prevail. They will take us any place we  desire. Go back to your stations. Maintain your controls. If resistance  mounts, call upon their beast. Their beast will serve us well. The fear  in each one of them is the beast which will consume him. Remember how  it was on Triacus. If they resist, so shall it be on the Enterprise. If  you need me, call and I will appear. Our new goal is Marcos Twelve. It  is our new beginning. We must not falter.  (The appararition vanishes.)  Foolish. You will be destroyed. I would ask you to join me, but  you are gentle, and that is a grave weakness.
