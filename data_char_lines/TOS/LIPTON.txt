Yes, security?  (Isis yowls, distracting the guard. Seven whips out his 'pen' and zaps  the guard into immobility.)  Freeze! One move and you've both had it. [Launch Control] Get back over there. [Apartment - main room] (Roberta hits Seven over the head with the cigar  box.)  Hello? Hello, come in.
