(an African doctor, to Nurse Chapel) Vitalizer B.  Not good, sir.  We've no replacements for the damaged  organs, sir. If he's going to live, his Vulcan physiology will have to  do it for him.  Don't let these low panel readings bother you. I've seen this  before in Vulcans. It's their way of concentrating all their strength,  blood, and antibodies onto the injured organs. A form of self-induced  hypnosis.  Well, in a sense. He knows we're here and what we're saying,  but he can't afford to take his mind from the tissue he's fighting to  heal. I suppose he even knows you were holding his hand. (leaves)  Just as they should. This is Doctor M'Benga. There will be  someone with you constantly now. When the time comes, I'll be called.  (to Chapel) As soon as he shows any signs of consciousness, call me  immediately.  After you've called me, if he speaks, do whatever he says.  Yes. That's clear enough, isn't it?  [Cave] Please, release her.  As you saw, they must wait until the last possible moment then  fight their way back to consciousness. 
We're not sure. Doctor Sanchez is  conducting an autopsy right now. [Bridge] You asked for an autopsy report. It's only  preliminary, but the cause of death seems to have been cellular  disruption. [Bridge] It's as though every cell in the body had  been individually blasted from inside. [Bridge] Doctor Sanchez has ruled that possibility  out, sir. [Bridge] Well, the pattern of cellular disruption  was the same, but as to the cause, well your guess is as good as mine. [Bridge]
