You're aware of the effect an hour ago?  You may not be aware of its scope. It occurred  in every quadrant of the galaxy and far beyond. Complete disruption of  normal magnetic and gravimetric fields, timewarp distortion, possible  radiation variations. And all of them centring on the general area  which you are now patrolling. The question is, are these natural  phenomena or are they mechanically created, and if they are, by whom?  For what purpose? Your guess, Captain.  Exactly our consensus. I'm giving you the job  of finding out specifically.  KIRK; Aye, aye, sir. Can you assign me other starships as a reserve?  Negative. I'm evacuating all Starfleet units  and personnel within a hundred parsecs of your position. It's going to  be tough on you and the Enterprise, but that's the job you've drawn.  You're on your own.  Good luck.
