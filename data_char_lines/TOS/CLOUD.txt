(The male Yang, with a very deep voice.) Freedom? Freedom?  That is a worship word. Yang worship. You will not speak it.  You live with the Kohms.  You spoke to Kohms. They are only for killing.  (They get a bar free, Kirk turns around.)  That which is ours is ours again. It will never be taken from us  again.  (A a tattered flag is brought in with great ceremony. Red and white  horizontal stripes, with a corner of white stars on blue background.  Kirk and the others stand.)  I am Cloud William, chief. Also son of chief. Guardian of the  holies, speaker of the holy words, leader of warriors.  Many have died, but this is the last of the Kohm places. What is ours  is ours again.  (He goes over to the flag and puts his left hand over his heart.)  Aypledgli ianectu flaggen tupep kile for stahn  You know many of our high-worship words. How?  Where is your tribe?  Yet you killed many Yangs.  Bring him.  (He puts his ear to where a human heart would be, but a Vulcan heart is  not.)  He has no heart.  But which? If we should kill the good, evil would be among us.  Greatest of holies. Chiefs and sons of chiefs may speak the  words, but the Evil One's tongue would surely turn to fire. I will  begin. You shall finish. Ee'dplebnista norkohn forkohn perfectunun.  The fight is done when one is dead.  Hoola!  (The fight begins with an exchange of punches, then Tracey tries to  drag Kirk towards the knife.)  Kill him. It is written. Good must destroy evil.  (Instead, Kirk cuts their bonds just as Sulu and two security guards  beam down.)  You are a great God servant. We are your slaves.  KIRK; Get up. Face me.  When you would not say the holy words, of the Ee'd Plebnista, I  doubted you.  The Kohms?  I do not fully understand, one named Kirk. But the holy words  will be obeyed. I swear it.  (Kirk leaves the Yangs to gaze at the old papers with new eyes.)
