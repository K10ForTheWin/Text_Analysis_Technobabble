So you're the Fed, huh? Well, well, well, well, well.  Krako. JoJo Krako. I'm the head of the whole Southside  Territory. Hey, glad to see you.  Sit down, Kirk. I've got all of Bela's communications bugged. He  can't make a date with a broad unless I know about it.  Well, I guess you want to know why I brought you here.  Hey, I like that. That is sharp. That's sharp, eh, Zabo?  That's right, a deal. I want you to help me.  (He snaps his fingers, and the girl walks over to Kirk and starts  massaging his shoulders.)  Wrong! I know Bela. He didn't offer you beans. Now, me, I'm a  reasonable man. You give me what I want and I'll cut you in for, say, a  third. Skimmed right off the top. Well, what do you think?  You watch it, Kirk. The Book tells us how to handle things.  (snaps his fingers to recall the girl) You make hits. Somebody argues,  you lean on 'em. What do you think, we're stupid or something?  I haven't been arrested in my whole life! Listen, pally, I know  how to get what I want. You want to live, don't you, Kirk? You bet you  do. But after I get through with you, you're liable to be sorry unless  you come across. Hold him here. Tell Cirl the Knife to sharpen up his  blade. I just might have a job for him. Unless you come across with the  heaters.  That's too bad. Put him on ice!  [Small office] (They put him in a proper working office, with  letter opener, desk with blotting paper, a cot-bed and a nice old radio  with nice old valves and stuff inside. Kirk starts taking it apart.)  [Bridge] Well, ain't this nice? I was wondering how I was going to get  you back, and here you deliver yourself! Who's your friend with the  ears, Kirk?  I ain't, pally. Put down your heaters.  So this is the fancy heater, huh? How does it work?  The only thing I want you to tell me is how it works.  Of course I can!  I either trust 'em, or they're dead. Let's go in here and talk  about it. [Krako's office] Now we got no busy little eyes to worry  about. How does this thing work?  Toys?  How much is that?  I thought you guys had laws. No interference.  What's your cut?  All right, it's a deal. Call your ship. Bring down your boys and  whatever else you need.  You mean you're going to start sending down your boys now?  How the hell'd I get here? What? What happened? (Scott enters)  You. You must be that Scott fellow Kirk was talking to. I want to know  what happened.  I got rights.  You mean cement overshoes?  Listen. They got a ship. I know. I was there.  I'm not going to believe my eyes.  (general bedlam)  Let me say something. I only saw three guys in that ship. Maybe  there ain't no more.  That's your story, buster.  (There's a gunfight outside in the street.)  Hey, it's my boys. They're making a hit at this place.  (Everyone dashes to the windows to watch.)  Want to bet? (gets the gun off McCoy) Keep moving. One move out  of you two, I'll drill them. Give me the hardware.  Are you kidding? This one's all mine. From now on, nobody's  going no place. I'm going to be the big boss in this here territory.  I already seen it. You're nothing, Fed.  Well, all right. Go ahead. Don't get smart.  Gee, that's some trick.
