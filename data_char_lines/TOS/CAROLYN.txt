Aye, sir.  Well, I was up all night working on this report, sir.  All right, Scotty. Just let me give this to Mister Spock.  What am I doing down here, Doctor?  Correct.  Apollo, twin brother of Artemis, son of the god Zeus and Leto,  a mortal. He was the god of light and purity. He was skilled in the bow  and lyre.  Obviously he has some knowledge of Earth. His classical  references and the appearance of all this.  Captain.  (Apollo is back on his throne.)  But why? What you've said so far makes no sense at all.  Lieutenant Palamas.  Carolyn.  Oh, it's beautiful.  It's all right, Captain. I'll go.  Oh, it's lovely.  Frightened? No, I don't think so. Of course, a girl doesn't go  walking with a  All right, a god every day. What happened to the others?  Artemis, Hera?  You mean they died?  You really think you're a god?  But you said the others didn't die.  I don't understand.  Captain.  No, don't!  A father doesn't destroy his children. You said you were  gentle and understanding.  How can they worship you if you hurt them?  Apollo, please. (taking his hand) You know so much of love.  Please don't hurt them. Please.  Oh, yes, I'm all right. I have a message for you.  He wants us to live in peace. He wants to provide for us.  He'll give us everything we ever wanted, and he can do it, too.  I don't understand.  Yes?  What?  Yes. I love him.  No, not on me.  Oh, but you don't understand. He's kind, and he wants the best  for us. And he's so lonely. What you ask would break his heart. How can  I?  Yes. Yes, I understand. He's calling me.  Yes, sir. My orders and my duty.  (She walks away slowly, looking back.) [Bridge] I must say, Apollo, the way you ape human behaviour is  remarkable, but there are some other things I must know. Your  evolutionary patterns and your social development.  I'm sure they're unique. I've never encountered a specimen  like you before.  I'm sure that's very flattering, but I must get on with my  work now.  I'm a scientist. My particular specialty is ancient  civilisations, relics, and myths. Surely you know I've only been  studying you.  Love you? Be logical. I'm not some simple shepherdess you can  awe. Why, I could no more love you than I could love a new species of  bacteria.  Is that the secret of your power over women, the thunderbolts  you throw?  (She walks away, and a strong wind begins to blow. Thunder rumbles.) [Temple]
