Captain Kirk?  Captain, it is not necessary to remind you of the  importance to the Federation of Sherman's Planet. The key to our  winning of this planet is the grain quadrotriticale. The shipment of it  must be protected. Effective immediately, you will render any aid and  assistance which Undersecretary Baris may require. The safety of the  grain and the project is your responsibility. Starfleet out. 
I sympathize deeply, but  Starfleet cannot override Federation directives in this matter.  Has your crew suddenly become interested in  provoking a war? That is not Starfleet's mission.  You have not proved your case to the  Federation, or to Starfleet, for that matter.  Granted as fact, Mister Spock.  They would not dare harm him in the Gideon  council chamber.  You have answered what and where. I'm waiting  for your explanation of why.  Do you have evidence the captain's life is  threatened? Permission denied.  So noted.  [Captain's quarters]
Captain Kirk, I sympathise  with your wish to stay, but I hope you recognise the necessity that you  continue your mission at once.  Perhaps haven't made myself clear. Let me  restate it. You have been relieved of all responsibility for the  asteroid ship Yonada. Starfleet Command will take care of the  situation. (end of conversation)
