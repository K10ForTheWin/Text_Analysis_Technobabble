Isak, what is all this?  Why were you in their prison?  The Fuhrer?  Isak, Uletta is dead. Shot down in the streets.  She lived for five hours while they walked past her and spat on  her. Our own people were unable to help her. Now you ask me to help  strangers.  This way.  [A side chamber] (A barrel is Spock's work table.)  I alone am responsible for what happens here.  No, wait. (gets up) No more. You've proved they're on our side.  Yes. If we had taken you into our confidence, we could've  betrayed all our people if you'd been Nazi spies. All right, leave us.  The Deputy Fuhrer. He's taken over.  Who?  And what is your people?
