Hi. Who are you?  I'm Tommy Starnes. This is Mary, Steve, Ray, and Don.  Yes, they did.  Busy, busy.  Can we have some more ice cream, please?  See what I told you? They all say it.  Saw where?  You were there.  I saw him.  Yeah, he was very upset.  I didn't ask him.  How should I know? He was always upset, just like you, Captain  Kirk.  You have your reasons.  That place? That's for adults.  My parents? They love it down there. Always busy. (he nearly  chokes up) They're happy. Can I go now? I'm tired too, you know.  I know the way.  (Tommy leaves.)  Captain, after we leave here, can you take us to Marcos Twelve?  But I have relatives on Marcos Twelve.  Captain, can I stay here and watch? I'll be very quiet.  Hi.  (Tommy does the fist clenching thing, Sulu blinks and presses some  buttons and turns the navigation dial. Enterprise leaves orbit. Mary  arrives with her security guard.)  What is that?  Will we see that all the time we stay here?  He thinks he sees it.  Very soon. [Engineering] (Don influences the crew, then Scott walks in.)  Go to your stations. Mary, you remain here with me.  The crew will take us. The crew believes.  We are going to Marcos! We are going to follow our friend!  But we won't. We don't need him. We're not afraid of you.  He's not afraid of anything.  He is our friend.  No!  (Spock enters the bridge.)
