At last I have seen other humans.  One is not human.  Oh, so that is a Vulcan. I would like to discuss sub-dimensional  physics with him. You've taught me all you know in the area and you say  Vulcans know more.  Let me meet them.  Soon they will be gone. Let me meet them.  What is loneliness?  Flint, don't take this opportunity away from me. It's so  exciting.  I'm sorry.  Mister Spock, I do hope we can find a moment to discuss field  density and its relationship to gravity phenomena.  Captain Kirk.  Everything. Less than that is betrayal of the intellect.  Flint is my teacher. You are the only other men I've ever seen.  May I show you, Captain?  It is a thirst, a flower dying in the desert.  I do not know. Flint told me never to enter. He denies me  nothing else.  I do not know. I come here when I am troubled, when I would  search myself.  Yes.  He is the greatest, kindest, wisest man in the galaxy.  Stop command. Stop.  (M4 ignores her and pursues Kirk around the room. Spock vapourises it  with his phaser as it starts to fire at Kirk)  I'm glad he did not die.  You sent the robot to kill him.  My mind could not have summoned it. I was not frightened.  Never.  You will let them have the ryetalyn?  Captain?  I've come to say goodbye.  I've known security here.  No.  You must not do this to them.  I cannot be the cause of this. I will not be the cause of this.  Please stop. Stop! I choose where I want to go.  (The men stop fighting in astonishment)  what I want to do. I choose. I choose.  No. Do not order me. No one can order me!  I was not human. Now I love. I love.  (She collapses. McCoy checks for a pulse)
