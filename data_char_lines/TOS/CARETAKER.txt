I'm the caretaker of this place, Captain Kirk.  But of course. Lieutenant Rodriguez, Lieutenant Sulu, Yeoman  Barrows and Mister Spock. We've just discovered you don't understand  all this. These experiences were intended to amuse you.  But none of this is permanent. Here you have to only imagine  your fondest wishes, either old ones you wish to relive or new ones,  anything at all. Battle, fear, love, triumph. Anything that pleases you  can be made to happen.  Of course.  This entire planet was constructed for our race of people to  come and play.  Exactly, Captain. How very perceptive of you.  We regret that some of you've been made uncomfortable.  My impression is that your race is not yet ready to  understand us, Captain.  However.  If you would use the proper caution, this amusement planet  of ours could be an ideal place for your people to enjoy themselves, if  you wish.
