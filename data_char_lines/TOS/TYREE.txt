Villagers!  (There's a chase, hunters after the villagers, and the villagers  pursuing Kirk and Spock. A shot is fired, which McCoy hears.) [Planet surface] Nona, enough. In time the villagers will return to their ways of  friendship.  I took you because you cast a spell upon me.  The night of madness.  No, Nona. No! It brought up evil beasts from my soul.  Nona, where's Kirk? The cave?  You must. He is the one I told you of. The friend of my younger  days.  I gave him my promise of silence. He was made my brother.  Nona  I am Tyree.  It is Kirk. She will cure him.  (Nona takes a strange object out of her bag. It is moving slightly.)  She must sleep also.  When a man and woman are joined in this manner, he can refuse  her no wish. But it is only legend. (Later, McCoy wakes to find Jim is out of bed. He  finds him by Nona's bed.)  Yes, James! James, it's good to see you.  My wife, Nona.  Much has happened since you left, James. Come, we'll speak of  it.  Come. (the men leave, but he stops Nona from following.) We will  speak of it. [Sickbay] (The markers on the indicator board above Spock's  head are going up and down like crazy.)  The firesticks first appeared nearly a year  ago. Since that time, many of my people have died.  I've looked into their village. I have seen it being done.  Strangers? No.  Yes, but the mugatos travel at night also. You killed one. Its  mate will not be far.  You will not speak of this to others.  No! I said I will not kill!  You will help in ways she does not understand. I have faith in  our friendship, James. Come, before we lose the darkness. (leaves)  The guard. We must wait.  Now. Come.  (Kirk sneaks around behind the guard and puts a sleeper hold on him.)  There! I left it there.  I do not want it.  Nona!  I want more of these, Kirk. Many more! Yutan, two of those who  killed my wife have escaped. Track them down. I will kill them.  (McCoy finds the phaser in the dirt nearby.)
