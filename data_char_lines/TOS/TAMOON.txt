(with a deep voice) No. I am only your drill thrall. I have  brought you nourishment. It is a nice name, Chee-koo.  Chee-koof! It is a very nice name. I am called Tamoon.  You are a fine specimen. I like you better than the others. I  will instruct you well, so my Provider will take you.  If my Provider is pleased, we may even be selected for each  other. [Kirk's cell]
