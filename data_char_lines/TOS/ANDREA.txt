I'm Andrea. You must be Christine. I've  always thought how beautiful your name is. And you must be Captain Kirk  of the Starship Enterprise. We appreciate you bringing Roger's fiancee  to him.  But you are exactly as Roger described you. No wonder he missed  you so.  I do not understand. Why are you unhappy?  You are with Roger again.  You are concerned about the captain?  How can you love Roger without trusting him? Why does it bother  you when I use the name Roger?  Yes, Doctor Korby. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, darling. As you  can see, Captain Kirk is fine. He won't be harmed. The things at stake  here simply make it necessary he doesn't send a report to his ship. I  need time to explain and demonstrate to him and to you. Now shall we  start with Andrea?  I'm like Doctor Brown, an android. Didn't you know?  I am now programmed to please you also. Is  the food appealing?  Please sit, Captain.  Doctor Korby suggested that you have lunch. He thought you  might have a few things to talk about.  No. Not programmed for you.  No. (leaves. Ruk blocks Kirk's attempt to leave)  Yes, Doctor.  I will find Ruk.  I will kiss you.  You, you will not?  He freed himself, and I destroyed, (sees Kirk there) destroyed  him. I am not programmed for alarms. I listened to your instructions.  They were mis-stated.  No. Protect. Protect. (to Korby) To love you. To, to kiss you.  Love you. Kiss. (Korby reaches for trigger and disintegrates  them both)
