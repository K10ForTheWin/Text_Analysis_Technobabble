Security to Captain Kirk. [Kirk's quarters] Lieutenant Joseph, sir. I'm on deck eleven, section A3.  I've just found one of the Tellarites murdered. I think it's the  ambassador himself, sir. [Corridor] Security here. We had to stun the Andorian. He had some  sort of transceiver. It was hidden in his antenna.
