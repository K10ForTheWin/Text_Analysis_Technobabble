(the glowing sphere) Welcome. I am Sargon.  You may use your tricorder, Mister Spock. Your readings will  show energy but no substance. Sealed in this receptacle is the essence  of my mind.  A body much as yours, my children, although our minds were  infinitely greater.  Because it is possible you are our descendants, Captain Kirk.  Six thousand centuries ago, our vessels were colonising this galaxy,  just as your own starships have now begun to explore that vastness. As  you now leave your own seed on distant planets, so we left our seed  behind us. Perhaps your own legends of an Adam and an Eve were two of  our travellers.  In either case, I do not know. It was so long ago, and the  records of our travels were lost in the cataclysm which we loosened  upon ourselves.  A struggle for such goals and the unleashing of such power that  you could not comprehend.  And we survived our primitive nuclear era, my son. But there  comes to all races an ultimate crisis which you have yet to face.  One day our minds became so powerful, we dared think of  ourselves as gods.  I have power even Henoch does not suspect, beloved.  Yes, my son. You can allow Thalassa and me to share your bodies  again. A last moment together.  (Mulhall nods, and they go over to the science station for the light  trick and voice change.)
