Captain, you're making a most  unusual request.  But you refuse to explain why it is so important.  Altair Six is no ordinary matter. That area is  just putting itself together after a long interplanetary conflict. This  inauguration will stabilise the entire Altair system. Our appearance  there is a demonstration of friendship and strength which will cause  ripples clear to the Klingon Empire.  You will proceed to Altair Six as ordered. You  have your orders. Starfleet out.
