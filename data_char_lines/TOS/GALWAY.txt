(a petite woman) Doctor, may I speak to you for a moment,  please?  I know this is going to sound foolish, but I seem to be having  a little trouble hearing.  I never had trouble before.  Thank you. [Kirk's quarters] What? You spoke to me, Doctor?  No. I don't want to sleep. Can't you understand? If I sleep,  what will I find when I wake up?  (Camera finally pans over to show us an old woman with a dowagers  hump.)  Thank you, sir. (on her way out) What a stupid place to hang a  mirror.  Doctor.  (She collapses in Kirk's arms.)
