You struck me. With your hand.  I am the eyes of Vaal. He must see.  Vaal is Vaal. He is everything.  I am Akuta. I am the leader of the feeders of Vaal.  (Spock and the others arrive.)  Akuta alone speaks to Vaal. I am the eyes and the voice of Vaal.  It is Vaal's wish.  They are my ears for Vaal. They were given to me in the dim time  so the people could understand his commands and obey.  We are close to Vaal so we may serve him. I shall take you  there. [Bridge] All the world knows about Vaal. He causes the rains to fall and  the sun to shine. All good comes from Vaal.  I shall take you to him, but he will not speak to you. He speaks  only to me.  Vaal.  Captain's log, stardate 3715.6. We have been  introduced to Vaal. Evidently the source of the planet's power  emanations and possibly the force that threatens both us and our ship.  [Vaal] Vaal calls me. Only then.  Vaal sleeps now. When he is hungry, you may be able to speak  with him, if he desires it.  Soon. Come. We will give you food and drink. If you are tired,  you may rest. [Village] These are the people of Vaal.  (Everyone is grown up, with white hair and wearing a simple cotton  sarong.)  There are no others.  Children?

Vaal has forbidden this.  These people, are from another place. They have come among us.  Welcome them!  Come! [Hut] This house is your house. I will send you  more food and drink. You are welcome in the place of Vaal.  I understand, Vaal. It shall be done. [Village] (Chekov and Landon are taking a romantic stroll  together.)  The law is plain. I have given you the words of Vaal. Do you beg  the lightning to strike?  You copied them?  Vaal speaks truly to me. The newcomers are a danger. Tell the  men of Vaal to meet me in the clear place when the strangers are  asleep. It is Vaal's own words. [Planet surface] (The men are waiting for Akuta. He arrives with a  It is a thing to do, like, like feeding Vaal. Vaal explained it  to me. I will show you. This (the melon) is the head of one of the  strangers. Find a heavy stick. Come up from behind the stranger and do  this.  (He swings his stick and smashes the melon to pieces.)  It is a simple thing. It is the word of Vaal. It will be done to  all of them when the sun returns in the morning.  (But he looks worried.)  [Hut] Vaal calls to us. Let us go to him. He  hungers. Please. [Vaal] But it was Vaal who put the fruit on the trees, caused the rain  to fall. Vaal cared for us.
