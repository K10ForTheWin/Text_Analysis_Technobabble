Message Received.  Finney here, Captain. Ion readings in progress.  Affirmative.  Ion pod.  Aye, aye, sir.  Hello, Captain! [Bridge] Nothing to say [Engineering] Captain?  You mean you're relieved because you think your career is  saved.  Well, you're wrong.  Like you helped me all along? Kept me down [Bridge] Robbed me of my own command? [Engineering] I'm a good officer, as good as you.  I've watched you for years. The great Captain Kirk.  (We finally see the man, as he jabs a phaser into Kirk's back)  They told you to do it to me. You all conspired against me. You  ruined me, but you won't do it anymore.  (He disarms Kirk and throws the weapon away. Kirk turns to face him.)  Oh, I wouldn't kill you, Captain. Your own death would mean too  little to you, But your ship  It's dead. I've killed it. I tapped out your primary energy  circuits.  You're out of power. I know the ship, too. The Enterprise  should've been mine. You kept me from it.  Innocent? Officers and gentlemen, Captains all. Except for  Finney and his one mistake. A long time ago, but they don't forget.  But they are to blame. All of them. [Engineering] I was a good officer. I really was. I loved  the service more than any man ever dared. [Bridge] Why shouldn't I? They killed me, didn't they? It's a fair  trade.  What do you mean?  What? Why did you do that? Why did you bring her here? I'll  kill you!  (Kirk takes his opportunity to grapple with the bigger man. There's a  fight in which Kirk's shirt gets torn. Finney swings at Kirk with a  wrench, but finally has his lights punched out.)
