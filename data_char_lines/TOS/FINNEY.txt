They told you to do it to me. You all conspired against me. You  ruined me, but you won't do it anymore.  (He disarms Kirk and throws the weapon away. Kirk turns to face him.)  Oh, I wouldn't kill you, Captain. Your own death would mean too  little to you, But your ship  It's dead. I've killed it. I tapped out your primary energy  circuits.  You're out of power. I know the ship, too. The Enterprise  should've been mine. You kept me from it.  Innocent? Officers and gentlemen, Captains all. Except for  Finney and his one mistake. A long time ago, but they don't forget.  I was a good officer. I really was. I loved  the service more than any man ever dared. [Bridge] Why shouldn't I? They killed me, didn't they? It's a fair  trade.  What do you mean?  What? Why did you do that? Why did you bring her here? I'll  kill you!  (Kirk takes his opportunity to grapple with the bigger man. There's a  fight in which Kirk's shirt gets torn. Finney swings at Kirk with a  wrench, but finally has his lights punched out.)
