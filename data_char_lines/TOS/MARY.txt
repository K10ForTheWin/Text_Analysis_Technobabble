Ring around the  rosy, pocket full of posy. Ashes, ashes, we all fall down! Captain's log, supplementary. We have buried the  members of the Starnes exploration party. Everyone has been deeply  affected by what has happened here, with some important exceptions.  [Planet surface] (Grave markers with just surnames stand behind one  or two mounds of soil. Kirk plants a UFP standard. The children have  had enough.)  Let's go and play.  (They run off to the cave entrance and play tag)  But we're just beginning to have fun.  That was fun.  Please do.  You weren't there very long. You don't know.  Ha. That's what you think.  Watch out. Watch out. I'll sting you.  (She rushes at Kirk and he picks her up.)  Yeah.  Aw, do we have to?  (Chapel ushers the little ones out.)  He sees Triacus on the screen.  Will we reach Marcos Twelve soon?  They will! They will!  He will come if we call him.  He's not afraid of anybody.
