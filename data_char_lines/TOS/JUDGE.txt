Open up. Rouse him.  (The somberly clothed judge sits on a stool opposite Kirk)  You're the thief who talks to spirits.  Where are you from?  What is this island?  I know no island Earth. No matter. Continue.  Then you deny being her accomplice?  Perhaps your part in this is innocent. I believe you to be an  honest man.  Take care, woman. I am convinced of your guilt. Do not compound  it with false accusation.  You heard these spirits?  I know nothing of this. Send for someone learned in witchcraft  and let him examine him. I will have nothing to do with it.  I know of no Atoz.  I know nothing of this, nothing of these matters! I will not  hear him!  I will not hear him.  (Judge and law man leave)  Jailor! Jailor!  You will come with me before the inquisitional tribunal. There  the matter of your witchcraft will be decided.  Jailor! That is sacrilege. If they hear you, they will burn you  for such beliefs.  Do not let them hear you. There are witches! There are! You  yourself may be discovered to be a witch by the inquisitor. No! What  are you doing? No!  (Kirk drags him inside the cell)  Help! Help!  I beg you. Do not implicate me. They would burn me.  I will do everything I can to prove you innocent. I will  disprove all the charges of witchcraft. But you must never again speak  to the comrades you left behind.  You cannot get back.  We can never go back. We must live out our lives here in the  past. The atavachron has prepared our cell structure and our brain  patterns to make life natural here. To return to the future would mean  instant death.  Then you must get back at once! If you were not transformed, you  can only survive for a few hours here in the past. Come. Hurry. Hurry.  [Cave] This is where it is. I can't remember the exact spot.  (Kirk feels along the wall until his hand disappears into it)  That's it! That is the portal. I cannot wait any longer.  (The judge hurries away, and Kirk slips through the wall back into the  library)  [Library]
