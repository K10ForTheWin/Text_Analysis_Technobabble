Yes.  Yes.  I know. It's Festival. It's the will of Landru.  They're visitors.  There. You see, Hacom? They've merely come looking for a place  to rest afterwards.  They've come looking for shelter. Can I turn them away? Come,  please.  Come, please. Hurry.  (He leads the way upstairs.)  You can return here at the close of the Festival. It's quiet.  You'll have need of rest.  The hour is struck. You can hear.  (alarmed) Landru? You ask? You're strange. You scorn Festival?  Are you? Are you?  No, no it's all over now. It's all over now,  child. That's all right. Quiet.  It's all right. It's all over.  It's Landru's will.  Then you're not of the Body. You couldn't be. [Drawing room] Are you, are you Archons?  It was said more would follow. If you are indeed  They're communing. We have time. Come with me.  To a place I know. You'll be safe there, but we must hurry.  Landru will come. [Street] (They hurry slowly, smiling and bowing to passers  by.)  Peace.  No, it wasn't Bilar. It was Landru. Let's hurry, we haven't much  time.  (But a few paces further on, the passers by all stop.)  It's too late. Look.  Landru. He's summoning the body.  Perhaps through there, but Landru  They're in the Body. It's Landru.  Not anymore. He's been absorbed.  The Lieutenant is one of them. When he wakes, Landru will find  us through him. Leave him there. He's our enemy. He's been absorbed.  Comes from a time before Landru.  Nobody knows positively. Some say as long ago as six thousand  years.  He must not. He's been absorbed.  The Body absorbs its enemies. It only kills when it has to. When  the first Archons came, they were free, out of control, opposing the  will of Landru. Many were killed, many more were absorbed. When he  regains consciousness, Landru will find us through him. And if the  others come  Those like you and me, who resist Landru.  In threes. Myself, Tamar, who's dead now, and one other.  I don't know. Tamar was my contact.  He must not regain consciousness. He'll destroy us all. He's of  the Body.  I don't know, Captain. Some of us escape the directives. Not  many, but a few. It was that way when the first Archons came.  They had invaded the Body, but they resisted the will of Landru.  You see, Landru had pulled them down from the skies.  Landru.  (adopting a prayerful posture) Oh.  (The image of a tall, elegant man draped in robes appears against a  wall.)  Oh.  (A sound permeates the room, and knocks everyone out.)  Captain's log, stardate 3157.4. The Enterprise,  still under attack by some sort of heat rays from the surface of Beta  Three, is now being commanded by Engineering Officer Scott. The shore  party has been taken by the creature called Landru. [Prison] (Kirk wakes up in a chamber very like the previous  one, constructed of large stone blocks, but without the furniture. A  stone door has no handle on the inside. His communicator and phaser are  gone.)  There was war. Convulsions. The world was destroying itself.  Landru was our leader. He saw the truth. He changed the world.  He took us back, back to a simple time. A time of peace and  tranquillity.  No, no, I was wrong! I submit, I bear myself to the will of  Landru!  No! Lawgivers! Help! Help me!  (Spock neck-pinches him.)
