You are late, my friend Apella.  Give her to the man who killed the most of her people. The  others will see the profit in bravery. I'll make a Klingon of you yet.  (He hands over another flintlock.)  Your next improvement. Notice what we've done to the striker. See how  it holds the priming powder more securely?  Fewer misfires. When I return, we will give you other improvements. A  rifled barrel.  A way to shoot further and straighter. [Village] You will be rich one day, Apella, beyond your dreams. The leader  of a whole world. A governor in the Klingon Empire.  (Then McCoy's scanner whistles. So Kirk jumps the Klingon while McCoy  hits Apella with the steel rod he took.)
