How can we communicate? My thoughts, you are hearing them.  This is interesting.  A man needs the company of his own kind, or he will cease to  exist. He felt it to me.  The man needs others of his species. That is why you are  here. The man must continue.  Your bodies have stopped their peculiar degeneration. There  will be nothing to harm you. You will continue, and the man will  continue.  This is necessary.  I do not understand.  He is part of me. The man must continue.  He does not age. He remains forever.  I do not understand.  You are wrong. The man is the centre of all things. I care  for him.  If I were human there can be love? (vanishes)
