Aliens, you have encroached on the space of the Melkot.  You will turn back immediately. This is the only warning you will  receive.  (a pair of red eyes in the fog) Aliens. Our warning was plain.  You have disregarded it. You shall be punished. You, Captain Kirk, the  disobedience was on your orders. Yours is the responsibility. Yours  shall be the pattern of your death.  You are outside. You are disease. The disease must be  destroyed. Your plea has been heard, and sentence has been pronounced.  It is done. [Street] (And suddenly they are standing in a Wild West  street, with six-shooters and holsters instead of phasers.)  Captain Kirk. You did not kill. Is this the way  of your kind?  Approach our planet and be welcome. A  delegation will come out to meet you. Our warning threats are over.
