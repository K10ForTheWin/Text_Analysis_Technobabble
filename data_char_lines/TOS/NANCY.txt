Small thanks to the Starfleet.  I should've received the proper inoculations ahead of time.  I was sent to Epsilon Canaris Three to prevent a war, Doctor.  Thanks to the inefficiency of the medical branch of the Starfleet, I've  been forced to leave before my job was done.  How soon will we rendezvous with that ship of yours, Captain?  What's happening? I demand to know.  I insist you make your scheduled rendezvous with the Enterprise.    Just how long am I supposed to stay inside, Captain?  How perceptive of you to notice I needed one.  Must you keep it so terribly hot in here?  I feel infuriated, deeply put upon, and absolutely outraged.  I'll rest later, Doctor.  Thank you.  Terrible. How should I feel?  Doctor, will you please just leave me alone. It's the heat.  No! No! No! That's disgusting! We're not animals! No! Oh, no!  It's inhuman! No! No!  (Kirk and McCoy take her to a bed and lie her down. McCoy gives her an  injection.)  Doctor. Doctor.  I heard him. He was loved and he resents it.  No. I don't want to die. I've been good at my job, but I've  never been loved. Never. What kind of life is that? Not to be loved,  never to have shown love? And he runs away from love. (cries)  Ship's log, stardate 3220.3. Lieutenant Commander  Scott reporting in lieu of the Captain and the first officer. We are  continuing our search for the missing shuttlecraft.  [Bridge] (standing in the doorway) Zefram Cochrane.  We understand.  We are here.  Both of us. Those you knew as the Commissioner and the  Companion. We are both here.  That is for the Maker of all things.  That part of us was too weak to hold on. In a moment, there  would have been no continuing. Now we're together.  We are one.  (She goes to Cochrane, who takes a step back.)  Zefram, we frighten you. We've never frightened you before.  Loneliness. This is loneliness. Oh, what a bitter thing. Oh, Zefram,  it's so sad. How do you bear it, this loneliness?  That will not be necessary, Captain. Your vehicle will operate  as before, so will the communications device.  We could do nothing now to stop you. You said we would not know  love because we were not human. Now we are human. We'll know the change  of days. We will know death. But to touch the hand of man, nothing is  as important.  Part of me understands. Part does not. But it pleases me.  Oh, let me walk, Zefram. Let me feel the earth against my feet.  Let me feel the warmth of the sun on my face. You beside me. Let me  feel these things.  I can't go with you, Zefram.  My life emanates from this place. If I should leave it for more  than a tiny march of days, I'll cease to exist. I must return, even as  you must consume matter to maintain your life.  The joy of this hour. I am pleased.  You must be free, Zefram Cochrane. 
(singing outside, then enters) Leonard!  Hello.  Let me look at you.  All good, I hope.  What? And let Plum examine me all alone?  A nickname I gave Leonard when we were very young.  I'd better go get Bob. Every time he starts digging he forgets  time, sleep, food, everything. Be back in a minute. [Planet  surface outside building]   Well, I, I  I was just. I couldn't find Bob, and I was coming back. I  crossed to your crewman. I wanted him to know I wasn't offended by the  things he'd said back there. You remember. Then I, I noticed he had a  Borgia plant in his hand. Before I could say anything, he, he'd taken a  bite from it. He fell, his face all twisted, and. Leonard, you're  looking at me like you don't believe me.  Salt. You did ask them about more salt tablets?  I'm so happy to see you, Leonard. The others, they, I, I don't  relate to them as much as you. You have such strong memories of me.  You do care, don't you, Leonard? It makes me feel so, so safe.  My husband? I like your feelings better. Much stronger. But  you're tired, You need to rest.  I think you should. I'll get you some water. [Corridor] (a  crewman lies dead, with mottles on his face)  You're so tired, darling. Just rest now.  It's nothing, dear. It's nothing. You just sleep. Nancy will  take care of everything.  Leonard. Leonard, wake up. Please help me. Help me, Leonard.  They're trying to kill me. Don't let them kill me!  But you must help me!  Leonard, if you love me, make him go away.  Leonard, help me.  Leonard. Leonard, no. Leonard, please.
