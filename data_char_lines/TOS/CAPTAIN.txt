We were en-route to  Starbase 9 for resupply when a black star of high gravitational  attraction began to drag us toward it. It required all warp power in  reverse to pull us away from the star. But, like snapping a rubber  band, the breakaway sent us plunging through space, out of control, to  stop here, wherever we are.
