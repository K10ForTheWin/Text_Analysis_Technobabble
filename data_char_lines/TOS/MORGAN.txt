You'll dirty yourself with this scum. Come on.  Now, Claiborne.  If you don't want any trouble, what are you doing in my town?  Five of you. You'd like me to draw, wouldn't you? All right, I  will. Soon enough. Soon enough.  (Morgan Earp leaves.)  We're done talking, Clanton.  I always said you was yellow, Clanton.  Oh, yeah. We heard the talk about your jokes.  Sure. Well, I'm glad to meet you Mister Kirk.  (Morgan punches Kirk and they fight briefly. Kirk gets Morgan in front  of him as a shield from Wyatt's gun then lets him go.)  No, Wyatt. Let me. When the time comes, I'll pay him for this.  I warned you, Claiborne. Stay away.  (Morgan punches Chekov, knocking him down.)  You don't have to take anything from that scum, not while I'm  here.
