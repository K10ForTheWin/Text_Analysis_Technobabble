Hold it! Okay, pally, we're going for a ride.  Listen, pally, this could either be a taxi or a hearse. You know  what I mean?  Sharp, Boss.  (waking up) Oh, not again. (rouses the other  man) Hey, wake up. You all right? (opens the door) Hey, you guys. Come  in here. The Feds snatched Krako. I never seen anything like it.  They're going to move in unless we stop 'em now.  Well, Bela's mixed up in this somehow. I've got a sneaking hunch  they're going to high-tail it back to his territory. You know what  we're going to do? We're going to hit his place.  [Oxmyx's office] All right. You know what to do. We hit Bela's  place and nobody comes out alive. All right. Let's go.  [Oxmyx's office] (It's getting crowded and noisy. The minor bosses  are all sporting bowler hats. Krako is there too. Kirk is standing on  the pool table.)
