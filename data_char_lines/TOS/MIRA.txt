Anything else?  We're ready, sir.  Thank you.  I'm, I'm fine.  I'm fine, Doctor. Really, I am. Is everybody else all right?  Why? I feel  Yes, sir.  What's that you're doing, Nurse?  But why? I haven't had a single response worth noting.  Well, have l?  I want to know why too. You're the doctor, you tell me. This is a  new experience for me.  All of you are accustomed to new experiences. It's part of your  work. I'm not.  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Doctor, there is nothing more I can tell you.  Are you putting that into my record? It's not true.  When the record of this is forwarded, I'll be sent back, won't I.    Did you?  I want to continue.  I hope that's all it is.  [Bridge] Yes, Captain.  What did I say?  What did it sound like?  What technician?  We must get back to the ship!  That storm, it's returning.  I know. You'll be killed if we stay.  I tell you t will kill us. [Bridge] I saw those men dead, in their exact  positions!  No, Scotty.  Never.  I've always believed it.  Then what is it, Scotty? What's frightening me?

You mustn't worry about hurting me.  Yes, there was one other time.  I saw Scotty.  I don't know.  He was dying. Now I understand what's been happening. I've been  seeing through another mind. I've been flooded with thoughts not my own  that control me. Oh, Scotty, Scotty! I'd rather die than hurt you. I'd  rather die.  SCOTT@ All right, now. What's all this talk of dying? They've called  the turn on us three out of four times. Now, that's a better average  than anybody deserves. It's our turn now. We'll fight them. So let's  not hear anything more about dying.  Tell me what to do.  Don't touch me, Scotty! Stay away.  (Then enter Mira. She changes colour and makes the strange noise)  I'm trying. I want to be with you. They are too strong.  I am Mira Romaine. I will be who I choose to be. I will. Stay  away, Scotty! They are with me. They will kill you.  Life was given to me. It is mine. I want to live it out. I will
