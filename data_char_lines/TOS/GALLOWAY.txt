Bridge, Security. Alert, alert!  Security 054, sir. We just found the  transport chief injured. [Bridge]
Is he dead, Mister Spock? 
Yes, sir.  (Spock leaves)  She regained consciousness very quickly.  Did the captain order it, sir?  The captain said no one is allowed to speak to Doctor Lester.    No, sir. Mister Spock, I think the captain meant that a guard  should be present.  Iâ€™m sorry, sir, but Doctor Lester cannot leave here. [McCoy's office] You're asking me to violate the captain's  orders.  You're as mad as she is. You're to leave here at once. I  follow orders.  Security guard! [McCoy's office] (Shaking hands) 
Galloway on the hangar deck, sir. All four of the craft  are still here. If they left, they didn't leave that way.  The helm was left on automatic, sir.  No, Captain. They're too wild. They act almost insane.
