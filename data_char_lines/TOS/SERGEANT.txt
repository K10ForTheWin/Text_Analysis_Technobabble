That noise. It's coming from one of these things.  (He has a communicator in his hand, so he puts down the bag and belts  and opens it.)  Stay right where you are. [Transporter room] Do they do that all the time?  Uh-huh.  Maybe some chicken soup.  (Kyle puts a card in the slot and the hatch slides up to reveal a bowl  on a tray. The Sergeant dips his finger in to taste it.)  It is. [Air Base - Corridor] (Captain Christopher walks past the guard on duty)
