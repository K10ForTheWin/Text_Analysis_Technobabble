All clear ahead, Captain. The sensors indicate zero register.  No, sir. Forward sweeps are negative. Wait. Verified, sir. We  must be in some sort of light warp or we'd have picked it up earlier.  Iron-silica body, planet sized, magnitude one E. We'll be  passing close.  Mister Spock, they're gone!  No sign of human life on the surface, sir. Unless the  instruments aren't functioning.  With due respect, sir. Request permission to transport to the  surface immediately and carry out a search.  Some kind of a joke, sir?  DeSalle to Enterprise. DeSalle to Enterprise. It doesn't  function. We're cut off.  (to Jaeger) Keep trying with yours. Something's blocking the  beacon. I've got to find open ground.  (He wanders off through the shrubs)  Mister Jaeger! McCoy!  (They join him to see a stone building in the gothic style, with an  iron-bound oak door. They approach cautiously, and enter) [Drawing Room] (The place is stuffed full of things. A bust of  Napoleon on a stand, a suit of armour, a globe, tapestry and swords and  shields on the walls, an open fire, a harpsichord and a large mirror)  Look.  (Sulu and Kirk are displayed in a mini-minstrel's gallery. McCoy scans  them.)  We've lost contact with the ship, Captain. We're trapped here.    My ancestry is French, yes.  (getting up) You  Captain, subspace interference is clearing.  Large body ahead.  (The planet swims back onto the viewscreen)  There it is again. Dead ahead.  Approach channels clear, Captain. 
I want you to take a close look at these, Doc. They're very  interesting. [Pasture] What do you think you're doing?  More like you're clumsy. 
We've already done it, Captain. It had no effect. We're  cooking up here.
