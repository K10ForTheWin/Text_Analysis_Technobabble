I remind you, Captain, I'm entirely opposed to this delay. Your  mission is to get those emergency medical supplies to Makus Three in  time for their transfer to the New Paris colonies.  I don't like to take chances. The plague is out of control on  New Paris. We must get those drugs there on time.  What is it, Captain?  I was opposed to this from the very beginning. Our flight to  Makus Three is of the very highest priority.  Yes, but you've lost your crew.  Two days? ln all that? Two days?  You shouldn't have sent them out in the first place. Do you know what you've done? You've concerned yourself with only seven people.  You said something about a needle in a haystack. It's useless. Well, Captain?  You don't really think you'll have any luck, do you?  Very well, Captain, but not one second beyond that moment. Is  that clear? If it isn't, I suggest you look at book nineteen, section  four thirty three, paragraph twelve.  Captain.  I don't relish the thought of abandoning your crewmen out  there, however I must remind you  You're running out of time.  (stepping into the turbolift) Twenty four more hours, Captain. [Shuttlecraft] You have two hours and forty three minutes, Captain.  I'm delighted. However I shall continue to remind you.  What do you intend to do?  I'm sure the authorities will be pleased by your diligence,  Captain. I'm not sure they'll appreciate the way you address a High  Commissioner.  You are, Captain. For another two hours and forty two minutes. [Shuttlecraft] Captain Kirk, check your chronometer. You'll see that it is  2823.8. Your time is up.  So are the plague victims on New Paris. I'm sorry, Captain. I  now assume authority granted me under Title fifteen, Galactic Emergency  Procedures, and I order you to abandon search.  You're procrastinating, Captain. You have your orders. Recall  your search parties and proceed to Makus Three immediately.
