You came! Thank the heavens. There's still time. It's not too  late. We can still stop him. But I, but I, need, need your help.  (He falls.) [Bridge] That's how I came to be down there,  Captain, pursuing the devil's own spawn, a thing I've chased across the  universe. He's humanoid outside, but inside, he's a hideous, murdering  monster. I'll get him, Captain. I swear it.  Not man! Thing.  To the last man, woman and child.  I was inspecting magnetic communications satellites. You  believe me, don't you?  That was he! He's death, anti-life, he lives to destroy.  Yes. I give you my word. I swear it.  Then you'll join me in my holy cause? Help me in visiting  justice and vengeance upon him.  Captain, you yourself said there were no other explanations.  Why do you give credence to this man?  No! You've come back in, is it? Well, don't stop. Here I am.  Come at me again. We'll finish it!  Come! Come! It'll do you no good. I'll chase you to the very  fires of hell!  (We're treated to a negative image of Lazarus suddenly being pounced on  by another person. They fight as the picture keeps being rotated to  make you dizzy. Then it all ends and Lazarus staggers back on the  planet surface again.)  I saw it again. The thing. It attacked me.  I told you it was a thing. All white, black and empty. A  terrible emptiness.  He'll kill us all if we don't kill him first! Kill! Kill!  Kill! Kill! Kill!  Captain's log, stardate 3088.3. We continue to  orbit the dead planet, which seems to be the source of the phenomenon  which has struck the Enterprise and all sections of the galaxy once  again. As for Lazarus, the story he tells me about the humanoid  continues to trouble me.  [Bridge] Yes. But impatient. Have you decided to help me yet?  (McCoy removes the plaster to show the cut.)  Is something wrong?  Yes! That's it! The dilithium crystals. With their power we  could do it.  Yes. We've got him, Captain, we've got him.  That's just it, that's the key. That's the way to trap him.  That's the solution. Captain, I beg of you. I plead, I demand. Give me  the crystals.  You fool! There won't be any ship if we don't kill him. He'll  destroy all of you.  I warn you, Captain. You'll give me the crystals.  No threat intended. Captain, I'll have my vengeance.  (He leaves the Bridge by the turbolift, and the guard follows a moment  later. Lazarus is walking along a corridor when he has another seizure  and loses the head injury. Lazarus heads for...)  [Engineering] And fact, Captain. I didn't take the crystals. I'm not the  one. Find my enemy, find the beast, and you'll find the crystals.  He did. Isn't that enough?  I tell you we're dealing with a creature capable of destroying  worlds.  For the same reason that I do. Listen to me. He's humanoid.  Why, he he can pilot a spaceship. He can compute formulas to destroy  races. He can steal an energy source for his vehicle so he can escape  from me. Are you deaf as well as blind?  Thank you, Captain.  What do you believe now, Captain?  Captain, look out! [Sickbay] The thing, the thing.  The rock, I  Aches.  Why shouldn't I?  Go ahead. It's all right.  You wouldn't believe me if I told you.  All right. I distorted a fact in the interest of  self-preservation, for my holy cause. I needed help, not censure.  Freedom, not captivity for being a madman. I was afraid that's what  you'd call me if I told you the truth.  My planet, my Earth, or what's left of it, is down there  beneath us.  My spaceship is more than just that. It's a time chamber, a  time-ship, and I. I am a time traveller.  Oh, yes. He's fled me across all the years, all the empty  years to a dead future on a murdered planet he destroyed. Help me!  Give me the tools I need to kill him! The crystals! Don't let him get  away! Don't let him get away.  I told you, he's got them. He took them. The thing! The thing!    Oh, I didn't know.  (He knocks the poor lad out, then sets co-ordinates and is beamed to  the planet carrying a bundle.)  [Corridor] (Kirk and Spock exit Engineering.)  I'll get you now. I have a threshold. Run, run. I'll get you  now. [Transporter room] It's done, it's done! Finished, finished.  It's done. It's done. It's done, it's done.  Done. No! Don't! Not you!  (Kirk leans into the saucer - and vanishes.)  No!  (Kirk goes into that negative space and finds that there is nowhere to  run to. Then suddenly he's on the ground on the planet again. Or is he?  He walks over to the saucer and is greeted by uninjured Lazarus.)  Welcome, Captain. I wasn't expecting you.  Yes, him. You understand.  Of course.  Here, yes.  The end of everything. Civilisation, existence, all gone. I  tried to stop him, Captain. That's why I took your dilithium crystals.  That's very bad, Captain. If he comes through at a time of his  own choosing. But I think if we hurry and you will help me, he can yet  still be stopped. There's little time left. He meant to come through.  When you accidentally passed through, it drained his crystals. It'll  take him about ten minutes to re-energise with the equipment aboard his  ship. That should give us enough time.  That's hard to explain, Captain. I call it an alternative  warp. It's sort of a negative magnetic corridor where the two parallel  universes meet. It's sort of a safety valve. It keeps eternity from  blowing up.  Precisely, Captain, but not because of its existence. Because,  because my foe entered. The corridor is like a prison, with explosives  at the door. Open the door, and the explosives might go off. Stay  inside  Both universes, Captain. Yours and mine.  Of course he knows, Captain, but he's mad. You heard him. He's  lost his mind. When our people found a way to slip through the warp and  prove another universe, an identical one, existed, it was too much for  him.  He could not live knowing that I lived. He became obsessed with the  idea of destroying me. The fact that it meant his own destruction, and  everything else, meant nothing to him.  Yes, Captain. Or he is. It depends on your point of view,  doesn't it? It's ready, Captain. If we can force him into the corridor  while I'm waiting for him, we can put an end to this. But if he comes  through at a time of his own choosing and breaks into this universe to  find me  Find him. Force him through his threshold, while I'm waiting  for him, into the corridor, and I'll hold him there.  Can't I, Captain? You destroy his ship.  It will.  Yes, and so will his.  Is it such a large price to pay for the safety of two  universes?  Send him to me. I'll be waiting.  (Lazarus activates his crystals manually, and Kirk vanishes, then  reappears on 'our' planet and gestures to Spock who has come down with  two guards.)  No! No! No, I'm not ready! I'm not ready!  (Kirk throws him through the threshold.)
