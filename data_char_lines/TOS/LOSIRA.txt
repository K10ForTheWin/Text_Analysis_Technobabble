Wait! You must not go!  (Before they have fully beamed out, the team see her touch the  transporter operator, and him fall to the floor.) [Planet surface] (Blue and orange clumps of grass amongst the  rocks.)  Do not be afraid.  I know. You are Lieutenant D'Amato, Senior Geologist.  From the spaceship Enterprise.  Do not be afraid.  I am for you, Lieutenant D'Amato.  I am only for D'Amato.  Do not call the others. Please.  (Somewhere else, McCoy gets out his communicator.)  My name is not important. Yours is Watkins, John B. Engineer  Grade four.  Show me this unit. I wish to learn.  Not correct. That is the emergency overload bypass, which  engages almost instantaneously. A wise precaution, considering it takes  the antimatter longer to explode once the magnetic flow fails. I am for  you, Mister Watkins.  I am unarmed.  That is not important. You are Lieutenant Sulu. You were born  on the planet Earth. You're helmsman for the Enterprise.  I am from here.  You do not understand. I have come for you.  I want to touch you.  I am for him. I am for Lieutenant Sulu.  I am for Lieutenant Sulu. Please, I must touch him.  (She puts her hand on Kirk's shoulder, but it doesn't hurt him. He  pushes her away.)  I don't want to destroy. I don't want to.  Only Sulu. I mean you no harm.  Please, I must touch him. I am for Lieutenant Sulu.  For you, James T. Kirk. Commander of the Enterprise.  For defence. You are Captain James T. Kirk, commander of the  Enterprise.  You are an invader.  I am Losira, Commander.  Of this station.  Feel? Killing is wrong.  You must not penetrate this station. Please, I must touch you.  No.  I am sent.  We defend this place.  They are no more.  I am for James T. Kirk.  Please. I must touch you. I beg it. It is my existence.  But you are my match, James Kirk. I must touch you. Then I will  live as one, even to the structure of your cells,  the arrangement of chromosomes.  My fellow Kalandans, welcome. A disease has  destroyed us. Beware of it. After your long journey, I'm sorry to give  you only a recorded welcome, but we who have guarded the outpost for  you will be dead by the time you take possession of this planet. I am  the last of our advanced force left alive. Too late the physicians  discovered the cause of this sickness that kills us. In creating this  planet, we have accidentally produced a deadly organism. I have awaited  the regular supply ship from home for medical assistance, but I doubt  now whether it will arrive in time. I will set the outpost controls on  automatic. The computer will selectively defend against all life forms  but our own. My fellow Kalandans,  I, Losira, wish you well.
