My fellow Kalandans, welcome. A disease has  destroyed us. Beware of it. After your long journey, I'm sorry to give  you only a recorded welcome, but we who have guarded the outpost for  you will be dead by the time you take possession of this planet. I am  the last of our advanced force left alive. Too late the physicians  discovered the cause of this sickness that kills us. In creating this  planet, we have accidentally produced a deadly organism. I have awaited  the regular supply ship from home for medical assistance, but I doubt  now whether it will arrive in time. I will set the outpost controls on  automatic. The computer will selectively defend against all life forms  but our own. My fellow Kalandans,  I, Losira, wish you well.
