Our destination has been scramble-fed  into ship's computers. Er, how can I handle the helm if I don't know  where we're going? 
Outpost four. Do you read me, Enterprise? This is  Commander Hansen.  Outposts two, three, and eight are gone. Unknown weapon.  Completely destroyed, even though we were alerted. Had our deflector  shield on maximum. Hit by enormous power. First attack blew our  deflector shield. If they hit us again with our deflector shield gone.  Do you read me, Enterprise?  Space vessel, only glimpse of.  Negative. It seems to have disappeared somehow. I have you  on my screen now. Switching to visual.
