Outpost four. Do you read me, Enterprise? This is  Commander Hansen.  Outposts two, three, and eight are gone. Unknown weapon.  Completely destroyed, even though we were alerted. Had our deflector  shield on maximum. Hit by enormous power. First attack blew our  deflector shield. If they hit us again with our deflector shield gone.  Do you read me, Enterprise?  Space vessel, only glimpse of.  Negative. It seems to have disappeared somehow. I have you  on my screen now. Switching to visual.  Enterprise, can you see it? My command post  here. We're a mile deep on an asteroid. Almost solid iron. And even  through our deflectors, it did this. Can you see?  No identification. No answer to our challenge.  Only a glimpse of it. Then they fired something at us, some form of  high-energy plasma.  Fantastic power. And then the whole vessel disappeared. But it's out  there somewhere. Our sensors show that much. Enterprise, something  coming on our viewing screen, coming at us fast.  Switching. Can you see it, Enterprise? Can you  see it? It's becoming visible in the centre of my screen.  (A ship appears from nowhere on the screen)  Negative. Phasers gone. Weapons crew dead. 
Enterprise standing by. Request confirmation.  Hansen here, Captain. [Starbase Computer Centre] Our destination has been scramble-fed  into ship's computers. Er, how can I handle the helm if I don't know  where we're going?  Acknowledged, sir.  [Starbase Computer Centre] Out of orbit, Mister Spock. Seems strange  with no navigator on duty.  Sir, scanners report an object following  us, about the size of a starbase shuttlecraft. Shall we reverse helm?  But at our speed, they'll never catch us. In case they want to  reach us  Sir, the engines are reversing. She's brought herself to a dead  stop.  Sir?  Transferring command to you, sir.  In his quarters, under arrest.  Sir, there's nobody up there giving orders. Mister Spock has  the computers running the ship.
