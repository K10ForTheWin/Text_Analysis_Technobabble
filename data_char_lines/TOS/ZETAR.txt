(through Mira) She cannot stop us. You cannot prevent it.  Yes, we understand you. We have searched for a millennium for  one through whom we can see and speak and hear and live out our lives.  We are from Zetar.  Yes, all corporeal life was destroyed.  The desires, the hopes, the mind and the will of the last  hundred of Zetar. The force of our life could not be wiped out.  At the proper time. Our planet was dying. We were determined to  live on. At the peak of our plans to go, a sudden final disaster struck  us down. But the force of our lives survived. At last we have found  someone through whom we can live it out.  She will accept ours.  Her mind will accept our thoughts. Our lives will be fulfilled.  We did not wish to kill.  No. Resisting us killed those people. We did not kill them.  We only want the girl.  Do not fight us.  You will all die.
