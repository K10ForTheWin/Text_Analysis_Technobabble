We thank you for your altruistic offer, Captain, but we  really do not need your protection.  We must be sure you are not harmed.  A Vulcan trader, perhaps. A dealer in kevas and trillium.  Harmless to the Klingons.  Terrible to destroy.  Brave men.  It is necessary. They may harm one another.  It will be hard.  We have put a stop to your violence.  All instruments of violence on this planet now radiate a  temperature of three hundred and fifty degrees. They are inoperative.  We find interference in other people's affairs most  disgusting, but you gentlemen have given us no choice.  No one has died here in uncounted thousands of years.  Your emotions are most discordant. We do not wish to seem  inhospitable, but gentlemen, you must leave.
