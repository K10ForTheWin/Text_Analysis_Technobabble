You won't find all this so lovely if our report for the  Captain isn't ready when he asks for it, which shouldn't be long.  (Kirk and Barrows beam down)  Yes, sir. We've completed the specimen survey.  Thank you, sir. And sir, I think you'll find Doctor McCoy  and Mister Sulu that way.  Of all the crazy things. Remember what I was telling you a  while ago, about the early wars and funny air vehicles they used?  That's one of them.  Not unless it makes a strafing run.  The way they used to attack people on the ground. (the plane  descends) Come on.  (They run along the path, as a second plane joins the first, straight  into a clump of trees. Angela falls to the ground having hit the tree.)    Angela. [Glade] (Everyone has been watching the air show, then Sulu  notices...)
