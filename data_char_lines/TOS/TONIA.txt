You need sleep, Captain. If it's not out of line  Sir, I don't see your name in any of the shore parties.  Aye, aye, sir.  (She leaves, and Spock enters)  It is beautiful. So lovely, and restful. I mean, affirmative,  Captain.  Where is Mister Sulu?  Doctor McCoy's rabbit, sir. He must have gone through here.  I don't know. I mean I do know. I was following the tracks, and  there he was.  Him.  He had a cloak, sir, and a dagger with jewels on it.  Captain, I know it sounds incredible, but I did not imagine it  any more than I imagined he did this.  Yes. Yes. It was so sort of story book walking around here, and  I was thinking, all a girl needs is Don Juan. Just day dreaming, the  way you would about someone you'd like to meet.  He ran after him.  A little, but I wouldn't want to be alone here.  That's just it. It's almost too beautiful. I was thinking, even  before my tunic was torn, that in a place like this a girl should be,  oh let's see now,  a girl should be dressed like a fairy-tale princess, with lots of  floaty stuff and a tall hat with a veil.  Is that a promise, Doctor?  (He takes her hands in his, and they gaze into each others eyes for a  long second. Then she spots her dream clothing hanging on some shrubs)  Oh, Doctor, they're lovely. Look at me, Doctor. A lady to be  protected and fought for. A princess of the blood royale.  Doctor, I'm afraid.  All right, but you stay right there. Don't peek.  There's no one here.  Don't talk like that.  He's dead.  Captain's log, supplemental. All contact with the  Enterprise has been lost. We're trapped here. Our ship's surgeon, my  personal friend, is dead. We're certain now that whatever we're facing  is terribly real.  [Glade] It's my fault. It never would have happened.  It's my fault.  It is, it is. I'm to blame.  Aye, aye, sir.  The black knight, too.  (not amused) And how do you explain them?  And so am l.
