Captain, Doctor McCoy has beamed  himself down to the planet. 
Not one hundred percent, Captain. We beamed down some inert  material, but it came back in a disassociated condition. We wouldn't  dare try with people.  Aye, aye, Captain. 
Security Chief here, sir.  Kirk; All decks alert. Captain Christopher is not in his assigned  quarters. He may be trying to escape the ship. I want a man outside the  transporter room immediately. I'm heading there myself. [Corridor] (Christopher gets the jump on a hapless red-shirt  and takes his phaser, then steps into)  [Transporter room]
Hey, Doc, I'm ready to energise. Everything okay with those  plants?  Well, sure, if you want.
