Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Live and direct from  City Arena, and in colour, we bring you Name the Winner, brought to you  tonight by your Jupiter Eight dealers from coast to coast. In just a  moment, tonight's first heat. We're in a taped commercial, Proconsul.  Forty seconds, then we'll be back live.  (Claudius, Merik and Kirk take seats on a raised platform. Kirk is  manacled, and there are two armed guards behind him. Spock and McCoy  are brought out by two guards in full traditional dress.)  Stand by. Ten seconds. And first tonight, ladies and  gentlemen, a surprise extra. In the far corner, a pair of highly  aggressive barbarians. Strong, intelligent, with strange ways, and I'm  sure full of a lot of surprises. And facing them, two favorites here  from previous encounters, Achilles and Flavius. (The canned applause is  turned up by a bored sound effects man) Victory or death? And for which  of them? Well, ladies and gentlemen, you know as much about that at  this moment as I do because this is your programme. You name the  winner.  Flavius may be getting off to a slow start, but he's never  disappointed this crowd. A close one. The barbarian with the pointed  ears seems to be in trouble.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Before tonight's first heat, a simple execution. Stay tuned to this  channel. There's a lot of excitement coming your way.
