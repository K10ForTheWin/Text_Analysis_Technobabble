Elias.  Mister Spock and I have met before. It's been a long time.  On Earth, six years ago.  If I did, it was important only to myself.  Mister Spock's feelings were never expressed to me. It is said  he has none to give.  There is no choice, Elias. He will stay. [Drawing room] (In another part of the farmhouse, McCoy is  conducting medical examinations.)  That can be explained.  Later.  And I never understood you. Until now. There was always a place  in here where no one could come. There was only the face you allow  people to see. Only one side you'd allow them to know.  I missed you.  If I tell you how we survived, will you try to understand how we  feel about our life here? About each other?  Someone else might believe that. Your shipmates, your Captain,  but not me. Come. [Drawing Room] It's not much further.  Its basic properties and elements are not important. What is  important is it gives life, peace, love.  Come. I was one of the first to find them. The spores.  It shouldn't hurt.  Not like this. It didn't hurt us.  Now. Now, you belong to all of us and we to you. There's no need  to hide your inner face any longer. We understand.  I've never seen a dragon.  Not here.  (She picks up the communicator and it opens.)  I'll wait.  I'm waiting for Mister Spock and the Captain to transport down.  They had some equipment to be moved. But it's been so long. I wish he'd  come back.  This is Leila. I borrowed the doctor's  communicator. I was worried something might have happened to you. [Bridge] Can I come aboard? I've never seen a  starship before [Bridge] Yes to both questions. [Bridge] You're no longer with us, are you? I felt something was wrong.  Come back to the planet with me. You can belong again. Come back  with me, please.  I love you. I said that six years ago, and I can't seem to stop  repeating myself. On Earth, you couldn't give anything of yourself. You  couldn't even put your arms around me. We couldn't have anything  together there. We couldn't have anything together anyplace else. We're  happy here. (crying) I can't lose you now, Mister Spock. I can't.  I have lost you, haven't I? And not only you, I've lost all of  it. The spores. I've lost them, too.  And this is for my good? Do you mind if I say I still love you?  You never told me if you had another name, Mister Spock.
