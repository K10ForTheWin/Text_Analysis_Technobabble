Captain, what are you doing here? You'll have to leave before  the Medusan ambassador arrives.  Mister Spock, do you have the visor? You must be sure to wear  it. Humans who get even a glimpse of Medusans  have gone insane.  And the reverse, of course, that what is beautiful is  automatically expected to be good.  Very special. I suggest you treat her accordingly. I've known  Doctor Jones long enough to be aware of her remarkable gifts. Well,  it's been a long day for me.  Some other time.  I thought the dinner was never going to end.  Yes, I know you did. I didn't. You were so far away.  Please don't talk of that. There's so little time. Please,  Miranda, don't go with Kollos.  Don't I know it. I've asked you in restaurants, in the  laboratory, on one knee, on both knees. Miranda, how can you do this?  I understand that you're a woman and that I'm a man, one of  your own kind, and that Kollos will never be able to give you anything  like this. (he kisses her but she doesn't respond) Why did I ever meet  you?  Miranda.  So now you want to help me. Now I know what a mere human male  has to do to get a reaction out of you. Make you think he's a patient.  The great psychologist. Why don't you try being a woman for a change? (Marvick leaves and starts walking along the  corridor. Then he stops, turns, and goes back to Kollos' quarters. The  Medusan opens his box lid as Marvick draws his phaser. Larry screams  and writhes about in the presence of the alien. Miranda senses  something is going on. Marvick dashes out into the corridor and runs  into the turbolift. Miranda comes out of her room and goes to Kollos  without her visor. She picks up the phaser from the floor. Marvick  assaults a crewman in another corridor. Kirk and a security detachment,  followed by Spock and McCoy, arrive at Kollos' door.)  [Corridor] Where's Mister Scott? [Corridor] We'll be safe at the boundaries of the  universe! We'll be safe!  (Kirk and three security men finally drag Marvick away from the  controls, just as the ship hits the galactic boundary.)  Beyond the boundaries of the galaxy. We made it. We're safe.  We're safe, Captain Kirk.  Oh, no. No! No, Captain. We mustn't sleep. No! No! No, they  come in your dreams. That's the worst. They suffocate in your dreams.  No!  No.  No.  KIRK; Come on. We must stay here with the controls. Ready to speed.  Speed! Speed to the next galaxy. Miranda? Miranda, you're here. With  me.  I didn't lose you. Oh, my beautiful love, I thought I'd lost  you.  Liar! Liar! Deceiver! You're not alone! You brought it with  you. It's here. It's here. You brought it with you! Liar!  Liar! Liar! (he tries to strangle Miranda) Don't love her! Don't love  her! She'll kill you if you love her! I love you, Miranda.  (Marvick collapses.)
