You are not the Others?  Men?  You are small, like the Others.  Givers of pain and delight.  No. They come. They give pain and delight.  They are here. You will see. The Others will come for you. They  come for all like us.  Women?  Your words say nothing.  Mate?  (afraid) No one wants to find them.  No! No! No, do not go there! No! No!
