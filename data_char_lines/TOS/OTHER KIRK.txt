I don't need you. (Spock neck-pinches him, and his phaser  fire hits a panel instead)  [Sickbay] Help me.  What are you going to do?  There's nothing I can do to stop you.  I won't fight you anymore. Oh, I feel so weak. I'll be glad  when this is over. (grabs Kirk and knocks him out)  [Corridor] Prepare to leave orbit, Mister Farrell. Well?  I gave you an order, Mister Farrell.  They can't be saved. Prepare to leave orbit.  I've changed my mind. Man your station, Mister Spock.  (McCoy enters with another Kirk, identically dressed) Grab him. He's  the impostor.  McCoy, he's fooled you.  Mister Spock, you know who I am. You know what that is.  I'm the captain. Isn't that obvious? Look at his face.  Remember the scratches? Look how he's tried to hide them. He wants you  to think that he's Captain Kirk. You know who I am.  You want to kill me, don't you? Farrell, James, grab him.  He'll destroy the ship! I'm the Captain. Don't you understand? I'm  captain of the ship! (starts attacking the crew) I'm the captain! This  is my ship! My ship! It's mine! I'll kill you.  Take another step, you'll die.  Please, I don't want to. Don't make me. Don't make me.  (Kirk takes phaser off him) I don't want to go back. Please! I want to  live!  I want to live!  [Transporter room]
