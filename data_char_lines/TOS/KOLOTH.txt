Ah, my dear Captain Kirk.  Let me assure you that my intentions are peaceful. As I've  already told Mister Lurry, the purpose of my presence  is to invoke shore leave rights.  Captain, we Klingons are not as luxury-minded as you Earthers.  We do not equip our ships with, how shall I say it, non-essentials.  (makes an hour-glass gesture with his hands)  I might also add that under terms of the Organian Peace Treaty,  you cannot refuse us.  Captain Kirk, there's been no formal declaration of hostilities  between our two respective governments. So, naturally, our relationship  will be a peaceful one.  Of course.  [Rec room] (Scott is at a monitor, reading, when Spock and  Kirk enter.)  Captain Kirk!  An official apology addressed to the Klingon High Command. I  expect you to assume full responsibility for the persecution of Klingon  nationals in this quadrant.  Yes. You've harassed my men. You've treated them like  criminals. You've been most uncourteous, Captain Kirk. If you wish to  avoid a diplomatic incident  Mister Spock, as far as Sherman's Planet is concerned, Captain  Kirk has already given it to us.  Captain Kirk, before you go on, may I make a request?  Can you get those things out of here?  (The guards take Jones' tribbles from him. They get to the door as  Darvin enters, and the tribbles shriek.)  Yes?
