Standing by, Number One.  Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.  (The laser cannon blasts away)  Our circuits are beginning to heat. We'll have to cease  power. 
Spock here, Captain.  Any problems, Captain?  Acknowledge, Captain. Is everything all right?  Captain Kirk! 
Enterprise. Spock here.  Affirmative, Captain. Enterprise out.  Please repeat, Captain. I didn't receive that.  Enterprise log. First officer Spock,  acting captain. I must now use an ancient Vulcan technique to probe  into Van Gelder's tortured mind.  [Sickbay]
Not a vessel, a ground source. The third planet in this solar  system, according to my instruments.  Measuring the planet now, Captain. It's spheroid-shaped,  circumference twenty four thousand eight hundred seventy four miles.  Mass six times ten to the twenty first power tons. Mean density five  point five one seven. Atmosphere oxygen, nitrogen.  Affirmative, Captain.  More the, er, mid-1900s I would say, Captain, approximately  1960.  Readings indicate that natural deterioration has been taking  place on this planet for at least several centuries.  Not conclusive, Yeoman. The evidence would suggest that the  distress signal is automated.  Definitely humanoid, in spite of the distortion.  About three hundred years.  Right, Captain.  Guards! Cover me.  Children, Captain. Lots of them. We couldn't  begin to get close to them. They just seemed to scurry away, like  animals. Only children.  Being a red-blooded human obviously has its disadvantages. Now  there you have a museum piece, Doctor. (referring to microscope) Lens  type, manually operated, light-activated.  Progress report, genetics section, Life Prolongation Project.  This was three hundred years ago, Captain.  But children become adults.  Doctor, there are certain glandular changes which take place  upon entering puberty, are there not?  Is it not possible that these children here, as they enter  puberty, contract the disease?  It's illogical. It does not follow. All the adults on this  planet died three hundred years ago, but there are children in the  streets.  There may be other emotions at work in this case, Captain.  She's becoming a woman.  [Bridge] Spock here.  Acknowledged, Lieutenant. I have their calculations now.  According to their life prolongation plan, what they thought  they were accomplishing, a person would age only one month for every  one hundred years of real time.  Exactly, Yeoman. Evidently through some miscalculation, this  virus annihilated the entire adult population in a very short period,  leaving only the children.  Could very well be immensely old.  Difficult, if we can't even get a glimpse of them.  Impossible. They know the area too well, like mice.  Is at least three hundred years older than you are, Yeoman.  Think about it.  [Old Toy Shop] Acknowledged.  This fellow made these notes in the last weeks after the  disaster began. I disregard these last entries. He said himself he was  too sick, too far gone to be sure he wasn't already mad, and I agree,  but based on the entries he made before that, I know how much time we  have. The ship's computers will verify my figures.  Our guess was correct. They contract the disease as they enter  puberty and their metabolism changes. The notes would indicate it  doesn't become acute for a month or so. I estimate she has perhaps five  or six weeks left.  The older the victim, the more rapid the progress of the  disease.  I am a carrier. Whatever happens, I can't go back to the ship,  and I do want to go back to the ship, Captain.  I presume my calculations are correct.  Spock here.  Verified, Captain. We have seven days.  Captain's Log, supplement. This is the second day  of the seven left to us. We've found nothing. Enterprise is standing by  with labs and computers ready to assist us.  [Laboratory] Unfortunately, they weren't successful. We've seen the results.  No, nothing.  Communicators, Captain, they're gone.  The nitrogen cycle, it has to be.  That is a very good question.  That's not all, Captain. We've got to find those communicators.  We've got to have those communicators, Jim.  Without them, it could be a beaker full of death.  We must. The vaccine could be fatal.  Bickering is pointless. I'll check on the Captain's progress.    (Spock leaves. McCoy picks up the hypospray and injects himself, then  collapses in agony)  Not yet.  He injected himself with the vaccine. He was unconscious when I  found him.  The blemishes are fading. They're fading. Who will understand  the medical mind?  Captain?  Warp factor one, Captain. <Back  to the episode listing Star  Trek ® is copyright of  CBS  Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

A good empirical research scientist. Steady, reputable,  occasionally brilliant.  I have no information on that, Captain. We are ready to leave  orbit.  Ready to resume course, Captain.  What kind? Personnel? Cargo?  How did you know this lady was coming  aboard?  May I inquire as to our course, Captain?  Benecia Colony is eight light years off our course.  We'll arrive stardate 2825.3, Captain, approximately fifteen  hundred Benecia time.  (Kirk goes over to Spock's station and throws a few switches)  Captain.  He came up from engineering, Captain.  Any explanation? He's a fine young officer. He's bound to  consider this transfer a disciplinary action.  Spare me your philosophical metaphors, Doctor. The Captain is  acting strangely. I'm asking if you've noticed.  My father's race was spared the dubious benefits of alcohol.  It occurred. I dismissed it.  Did you know that he suddenly transferred Lieutenant Riley to  engineering?  No, thank you.  Full personal dossiers on the following names. Doctor Thomas  Leighton, Anton Karidian, Lieutenant Kevin Riley, and Captain James T.  Kirk.  Correlate. Check their past histories. Report any item, any past  episode or experience they all have in common.  I will continue, Doctor. According to our library banks, it  started on the Earth colony of Tarsus Four, when the food supply was  attacked by an exotic fungus and largely destroyed. There were over  eight thousand colonists and virtually no food. And that was when  Governor Kodos seized full power and declared emergency martial law.  You may not have heard it all. Kodos began to separate the  colonists. Some would live, be rationed whatever food was left. The  remainder would be immediately put to death. Apparently he had his own  theories of eugenics.  Perhaps not. But he was certainly among the most ruthless, to  decide arbitrarily who would survive and who would not, using his own  personal standards, and then to implement his decision without mercy.  Children watching their parents die. Whole families destroyed. Over  four thousand people. They died quickly, without pain, but they died.  Relief arrived, but too late to prevent the executions. And Kodos?  There never was a positive identification of his body.  His history begins almost to the day where Kodos disappeared.  He'd better. There were nine eye witnesses who survived the  massacre, who'd actually seen Kodos with their own eyes. Jim Kirk was  one of them.  With the exception of Riley and Captain Kirk, every other eye witness  is dead. And my library computer shows that wherever they were, on  Earth, on a colony, or aboard ship, the Karidian Company of Players was  somewhere near when they died.  You've got to pull him through.  If he dies, the only one who'll be able to identify Kodos is the  Captain. And he'll be the next target. Captain's log, stardate 2819.1. Ship's officer  Riley's condition worsening. Doctor McCoy making lab analysis to  determine cause and antidote. Entire crew deeply concerned. [McCoy's office] Someone tried to poison him.  I don't believe that and neither do you. I want the Captain to  see that report.  Now. [Captain's quarters] Can we predict the same for you, Captain?  Lieutenant Riley was a witness. So were you.  Someone tried to kill him.  You should be told the difference between empiricism and  stubbornness, Doctor. I checked with the library computer, just as you  did. I got the same information.  Is my personal business when it might interfere with the smooth  operation of this ship.  It could happen.  Even in this corner of the galaxy, Captain, two plus two equals  four. Almost certainly an attempt will be made to kill you. Why do you  invite death?  He is.  Logic, Captain. Doctor Leighton was murdered while the Karidian  Company was on Planet Q. Now an attempt has been made against Riley  while the company is on board the Enterprise.  Shh. Listen. Do you hear it? That low hum.  On overload. (starts searching)  You can't stay.  Evacuate this section. Seal it off. Clear  section C4 and C5.  (In Kirk's quarters the noise gets louder, and finally he sees the  phaser silhouetted against the Red Alert light high in a bulkhead. He  gets it, dashes into the corridor and drops it into a convenient  pressure waste disposal unit directly opposite. Spock returns in time  for the bang that throws them against the opposite wall)  [Karidian's quarters] I believe we have a match, Captain.  Ready to leave Benecia orbit, Captain. 
Power up. All instruments activated. All readings normal. All  go. [Bridge] Position?  Make up your mind please, Mister Latimer.  Considerably, Mister Boma.  Stop forward momentum, Mister Latimer.  Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please.  Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. We are out of  control, being pulled directly into the heart of Murasaki three one  two. Being hit by violent radiation on outer hull. Course three point  two five [Bridge] I'd say your evaluation is reasonable, Mister Boma.  Picturesque descriptions will not mend broken circuits, Mister  Scott. I think you'll find your work is cut out for you. Galileo to  Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please.  I expect nothing, Mister Scott. It is merely logical to try all  the alternatives. Doctor McCoy, a reading on the atmosphere, please.  Just the facts, Doctor.  Thank you for your opinion. It will be duly noted. You're  recording this, Yeoman?  Mister Scott, if you'll make a survey of the damage, please.  Gentlemen, I think we should move outside, make room for Mister  Scott to do his work. Mister Latimer, Mister Gaetano, you'll arm  yourselves and scout out the area, keeping in visual contact with the  ship.  Under present conditions, extremely poor.  If the ionisation effect is as widespread as I believe it is,  Doctor, they'll be searching for us without instrumentation, by visual  contact only. On those terms, this is a very large planet.  Not as long as we're grounded. We may be here for a very long  time, Doctor. [Bridge] (Enterprise is orbiting a sickly green swirled  planet, and Commissioner Ferris is lounging by the door, watching Uhura  working.)  My big chance? For what, Doctor?  I am a logical man, Doctor.  Perhaps, Doctor, but I know of no better way to begin. I realise  command does have its fascinations, even under circumstances such as  these. But I neither enjoy the idea of command, nor am I frightened of  it. It simply exists. And I will do whatever logically needs to be  done.  Excuse me.  (he heads back inside)  [Shuttlecraft] In what way?  The weight of three grown men.  Doctor McCoy, with very few exceptions we use virtually every  piece of equipment aboard this craft in attaining orbit. There's very  little excess weight, except among the passengers.  Unless the situation changes radically, yes.  As commanding officer, the choice will be mine.  A very quaint idea, Mister Boma, but I do believe I'm better  qualified to make the selection than any random drawing of lots.  My choice will be a logical one, arrived at through logical  means.  But attaining a desired goal always is, Doctor. Now gentlemen, I  suggest we move outside to make a further examination of the hull in  the event we've overlooked any minor damage.  (Spock leaves)  Come on, Boma. [Bottom of the ledge] (Gaetano fires his phaser at several different  enemies. The spear in Latimer's back is taller than a man)  What was it?  (returns from investigating) Nothing there.  I don't doubt your word.  (pulling the bloody spear from Latimer's body and examining it)  Folsom Point.  There's a remarkable resemblance to the Folsom Point discovered  in 1925, old world calendar, New Mexico, North America. A bit more  crude about the shaft, I believe. Not very efficient.  Am I in error, Mister Boma?  Then what, Mister Boma?  My concern for the dead will not bring him back to life, Mister  Boma.  Bringing him back to the ship should not interfere with our  repair efforts. If you need assistance, I  Perhaps if you were to channel the second  auxiliary tank through the primary intake valve.  Excellent, Doctor.  Which would still leave us at least one hundred and fifty pounds  overweight.  It is more rational to sacrifice one life than six, Doctor.  You might be wise to start.  For what?  Mister Boma, we're working against time.  Doctor, perhaps you know the correct words for such an occasion.    My place is here. If you please, Doctor.  By dealing with first things first, I hope to increase our  chances of staying alive. Well, Mister Scott.  What happened?  That would seem to solve the problem of who to leave behind.  Consider the alternatives, Mister Scott.  Mister Scott, there are always alternatives.  Wood rubbing on some kind of leather.  Not a tribal culture. Their artefacts are too primitive. More  likely a loose association of some sort.  How, Mister Boma?  I'm frequently appalled by the low regard you Earthmen have for  life.  Mister Boma?  Doctor McCoy?  It does, indeed. It seems logical to me, also. But to take life  indiscriminately,  I am not interested in the opinion of the majority, Mister  Gaetano. Components must be weighed. Our danger to ourselves as well as  our duties to other life forms, friendly or not. There's a third  course.  I think not. Doctor McCoy.  You and Yeoman Mears return to the ship. Assist Mister Scott in  any way possible. We'll be back shortly.  Gentlemen, you'll follow my orders to the letter, firing only  when so instructed, and at my designated targets.  We'll fire to frighten, Mister Gaetano, not to kill.  I am in command, Mister Gaetano. The orders and the  responsibility will be mine. Follow me. [Rocks] (The trio are paddling through dry ice when a giant  spear is thrown across their path. Spock fires at one assailant, who  throws his shield at them too. They move on a little way.)  I hear them. They're directly ahead of us. Several, I believe.  Direct your phasers to two o'clock and to ten o'clock.  Yes, I know. But fortunately, I'm giving the orders. Take aim  please, and fire when I give a signal.  (He climbs partway up a rock, for a better view.)  Fire. (several seconds of sustained phaser beam) Cease fire.  (It's gone quiet) They should think twice before bothering us again.  It was not necessary. Fear will do for us what needs to be done.  Mister Boma, you will return with me to the Galileo. Mister Gaetano,  you remain on guard here. Keep in contact with the ship.  (Boma says a silent goodbye to his colleague, and the noise starts up  again)  [Shuttlecraft] Yes, we found them. They won't bother us again.  Go, Mister Scott.  That's all very well, but we don't have a substitute supply.  They would also seem to be our only hope.  (after brief thought) Yeoman, your phaser.  They won't attack for at least several hours. By then, with  luck, we'll be gone.  We don't have to maintain it very long, Mister Scott. In less  than twenty four hours, the Enterprise will be forced to abandon its  search in order to make a rendezvous. If we can't maintain orbit after  that time, it won't make any difference. If we burn up in a decaying  orbit or die here on the planet's surface, we shall surely die. Doctor,  your phaser. Go to work, Mister Scott.  Take this back to Mister Scott for conversion, please Doctor.  (handing over his own phaser) And give this to Mister Scott in  the event I don't return.  I have a certain scientific curiosity about what's become of  Mister Gaetano. Return to the ship, please.  (Spock leaves)  Most illogical reaction. We demonstrated our superior weapons.  They should have fled.  Of course.  Doctor, I am not responsible for their unpredictability.  They're studying us, for the moment.  My opinion, Mister Boma.  (The shuttlecraft shakes as one of the locals starts battering it with  a rock)  Seal the windows!  Mister Boma, your tone is increasingly hostile.  Curious. Most illogical.  Strange. Step by step, I have made the correct and logical  decisions. And yet two men have died.  I do seem to have miscalculated regarding them, and inculcated  resentment on your parts. The sum of the parts cannot be greater than  the whole.  MCCOY A little less analysis and more action. That's what we need,  Mister Spock.  How much longer, Mister Scott?  Mister Scott, how much power do we have left  in the ship's batteries?  Will they electrify the exterior of this ship?  Get to the centre of the ship. Don't touch the plates. Be sure  you're insulated. Stand by. Are you ready, Scott?  All right. Go. (Scott uses a spanner or something to short out  the battery connections) Again! Again!  (It goes quiet and still outside)  I believe we've used enough. Mister Scott. I suggest you  continue draining the phasers.  For the moment.  The moment they discover they're not seriously hurt, they'll be  back. Meanwhile, please check the aft compartment. See if there's  anything you can unload to lighten the ship.  It will of course have to be left behind.  I wouldn't recommend it. The creatures won't be far away.  It would expose members of this crew to unnecessary peril.  Gentlemen. All right, Mister Boma, you'll have your burial,  provided the creatures will permit it. [Bridge] How about weight?  And how long can we hold it?  To land here again? Not a very attractive possibility.  Doctor McCoy. Mister Boma. When can we lift off, Scott?  Gentlemen, The ship will lift off in exactly ten minutes. You  have that long to bury Mister Gaetano. Now, it appears to be clear  outside, at least for the moment. I'll assist you. Hurry. [Bridge] Get into the ship! Immediate lift off!  (He throws a spear back, then gets pinned against a rock outcrop by a  thrown boulder)  No! Go back! Lift off! Go back! No!  (But Boma and McCoy ignore his orders and free him)  All right, All right! Go! Go! Go! Go!  (They all get safely into the shuttlecraft)  Go, Scott!  I told you to lift off!  Get us off, Scott!  Quite right, Mister Scott. There's somebody holding us down. All  systems are go, but we're not moving.  (Throws switches on the pilot's panel)  Our boosters.  Would you rather stay here?  May I remind you we have yet to achieve orbit, nor can we  maintain it long. An hour from now we may be right back where we  started from.  (The Galileo leaves the sickly yellow and green atmosphere of the  planet)  Gentlemen, by coming after me, you may well have destroyed what  slim chance you had for survival. The logical thing for you to have  done was to have left me behind.  That is a most illogical attitude. Orbit in one minute, Mister  Scott. Fuel status?  It is the usual end of a decaying orbit.  Infinitely preferable to the kind of death we'd be granted on  the planet's surface, I should think.  Did l? I may have been mistaken.  The Enterprise is surely on course for Makus Three by now. I for  one do not believe in angels.  Yes. My first command.  Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise, come in, please.  Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please.  (He ponders for a moment, then flicks the Fuel Jettison button)  Perhaps, Mister Boma.  No one out there to see it.  (The plume of flame fades out)  Totally illogical. There was no chance.  Captain.  Quite correct, Captain.  Quite simply, Captain. I examined the problem from all angles,  and it was plainly hopeless. Logic informed me that under the  circumstances, the only possible action would have to be one of  desperation. Logical decision, logically arrived at.  Well, I wouldn't put it in exactly those terms, Captain, but  those are essentially the facts.  No, sir.  Yes, sir.  <Back  to the episode listing Star  Trek ® is copyright of  CBS  Studios Inc.

Captain, I believe I  Miss Finney, come with me, please.  (They leave.)  I know all about them.  Affirmative.  Negative.  Affirmative.  But the computer is inaccurate, never the less.  It reports that the jettison button was pressed before the Red  Alert.  And that is impossible.  No, I was occupied. The ship was already on Yellow Alert.  I do not dispute it. I merely state that it is wrong.  I know the Captain. He is in  Lieutenant, I am half Vulcanian. Vulcanians do not speculate. I  speak from pure logic. If I let go of a hammer on a planet that has a  positive gravity, I need not see it fall to know that it has in fact  fallen.  Gentlemen, human beings have characteristics just as inanimate  objects do. It is impossible for Captain Kirk to act out of panic or  malice. It is not his nature.  Yes. In my opinion.  Mister Finney is top of duty roster, Captain.  Attention, Commander Finney, report to pod for reading on ion  plates.  Officer posted, Captain.  (The ship suddenly judders)  Acknowledged.  Captain.  [Bridge] I've run a complete megalyte survey on the  computer. [Kirk's room] You sound bitter, Captain. [Kirk's room] Further instructions? [Kirk's room] Chess.  [Kirk's room] (The door opens)  Explain.  That is true.  Why, thank you, Doctor. I've just won my fourth game.  Observe for yourself. Rook to king's pawn four.  Now, this is the computer's move. And now mine. (takes the  bishop) Checkmate. Mechanically, the computer's flawless. Therefore,  logically, its report of the captain's guilt is infallible. I could not  accept that, however.  Exactly. I programmed it myself for chess some months ago. The  best I should have been able to attain was a draw.  Transporter room, stand by. We're beaming down.  [Courtroom] Five in all.  Affirmative.  I personally programmed the computer for chess months ago. I  gave the machine an understanding of the game equal to my own. The  computer cannot make an error and assuming that I do not either, the  best that could normally be hoped for would be stalemate after  stalemate, and yet I beat the machine five times. Someone, either  accidentally or deliberately, adjusted the programming and therefore  the memory banks of that computer.  Affirmative.  The Captain, myself, and the records officer.  Affirmative. Until he was lost, our records officer was  Lieutenant Commander Finney.  Affirmative, Captain.  B deck, in or near Engineering.  Acknowledged.  Compensate.  Decaying, Captain.  Gentlemen, if you'll please hurry to the transporter room  Very well, sir. [Engineering] Activate port impulse engines. One third power.  (Uhura takes navigation)  Obviously. 
Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up  message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos.  [Bridge]
Scouts have detected no animals, artefacts, or force fields  of any kind. Only peace, sunshine, and good air. You'll have no  problems.  (But as these words are spoken, a rock raises itself to reveal a  classic western-style six shooter gun.)  (Elsewhere, a man and a woman are taking scans of the vegetation)  Captain.  A highly sophisticated type of energy draining our power  and increasing, beginning to affect our communications.  There must be some logical explanation. [Bridge]
Captain, we're receiving you. 
Captain. I wonder why he's insistent that our tactical aides  come down.  Perhaps, Captain, but nevertheless  Doctor, you are a sensualist.  Those messages we got, Captain, the one directing us here  yesterday.  Captain, impulses that direction. Very weak, possibly a survivor.  Getting another life reading, Captain.  Not survivors. Not warm-blooded. Living creatures, but not human.  Azimuth ninety three degrees, range one five seven zero yards.  We're hopelessly outnumbered here, Captain. It's those  disruptors versus our hand phasers.  Sulu is an experienced combat officer.  Nor can they at us at the moment. Not unless they moved their  original position. That intervening high ground.  About one hundred yards in that direction. But after an attack  as thorough as this one  How is he, Doctor?  They're moving. I've got to get to the Captain.  (He joins Kirk in the bomb crater, where a grenade launcher is being  set up)  Locked on to the enemy, Captain. They're moving toward the high  ground. (fizzing sound and smoke) They've locked on to my tricorder.  (He throws it away and it goes bang)  Very ingenious. They fed back my own impulses and built up an  overload.  Any word from the Enterprise?  Very clever. As to the reason?  You allude to invasion, Captain, yet positive proof  Not necessarily, sir. Several possible explanations  Very well, then. If that's the case, you must make certain that  the alien vessel never reaches its home base.  Virtually nothing, Captain. No records of any explorations.  There are rumours of certain strange signals on subspace channels.  However, none has ever been recorded.  Nothing specific, Captain. Unscientific rumours only. More like  space legends.  A sustained warp seven speed will be dangerous, Captain.  You mean to destroy the alien ship, Captain?  I thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be sufficient.  Destruction might be unnecessary.  The destruction of the alien vessel will not help that colony,  Jim.  I merely suggested that a regard for sentient life  Very clear, Captain.  It would appear someone is curious about us.  Computer lock ready, Captain. All systems standing by.  Same as the alien, Captain.  All systems report normal, Captain. No ascertainable damage.  KIRK; Then what is it?  We're being held in place, Captain, apparently from that solar  system.  KIRK; This far out? That's impossible.  We are being held.  No, sir. An unidentifiable power.  (The lights flicker and the viewscreen goes psychedelic.)  Have you tried overload?  How about bypassing the transformer banks? Feed the impulse  engines directly.  Lieutenant Uhura, have sensors learned anything about the nature  of the force which holds us here?  No indication of its composition? Gravimetric? Magnetic?  Electronic?  Leave channel one open, Lieutenant, just in  case.  I'm going to wait, Doctor. There's little else I can do.  If I could help him, I would. I cannot.  He's out there, Doctor. Out there somewhere in a thousand cubic  parsecs of space, and there's absolutely nothing we can do to help him.  [Planet surface] (Running up a slope, Kirk comes across a clump of  mature bamboo. Good, solid, hollow stems, but he doesn't regard them as  suitable clubs. He carries on gaining height. Meanwhile, the Gorn is  using trailing vines to construct something. Kirk comes across an  outcrop of minerals, and decides to tell us what they are.)  This is the U.S.S. Enterprise calling the  Metrons. Our channels are open. Come in, please. We urgently desire a  conference. Please answer. [Planet surface] (Kirk hobbles up to a rock face with bright yellow  powder spread across it, and takes a rest. We keep cutting to the Gorn,  who can hear everything he says, remember.)  But it has happened, Doctor.  (Dimmed lights and swirly viewscreen again)  Yes, indeed, Doctor, if only there were. Notice the substance  encrusting that rock. Yes. Unless I'm mistaken, it's potassium nitrate.    Perhaps nothing, Doctor. (Kirk tastes the mineral and spits it  out) Perhaps everything.  (The bridge crew watch as enlightenment dawns and Kirk goes off in  It may well be possible, Doctor. We know very little about that  section of the galaxy.  Perhaps. That is something best decided by diplomats.  Yes.  (They watch as Kirk returns to the bamboo clump and picks out a short,  wide stem.)  Fascinating. Good. Good. (Kirk cuts vines to length against a  rock) He knows, Doctor. He has reasoned it out.  (Potassium nitrate gets shoveled into the bamboo)  Yes. Yes.  Recall your basic chemistry, Doctor. Gunpowder.  If he has the time, Doctor. If he has the time.  (The cannon is strengthened with the vine tied around it, and the  gunpowder gets rammed home with a small branch. Finally the diamonds go  in, and a piece of torn trouser will serve as a fuse, once he can raise  a spark from a stone and the translating device. Fire is created as the  Gorn approaches him from behind. Seeing the danger, he braces the  cannon and fires it. The explosion blows the bamboo apart, and also  incapacitates his opponent. Kirk picks up his fallen stone dagger and  puts the point to the Gorn's windpipe, but cannot administer the coup  de grace.)  After you touched off your primitive cannon, Captain, we lost  the picture the Metron was sending us.  KIRK; You saw what happened down there?  Most of it. I would be interested in knowing what finally  happened.  I've frequently had my doubts.  A thousand years, Captain?  Well, that gives us a little time. <Back  to the episode listing Star  Trek ® is copyright of  CBS  Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Your move, Captain.  I'll have you checkmated your next move.  Irritating? Ah, yes. One of your Earth emotions.  The fact one of my ancestors married a human female  Not large enough even for a lifeboat.  KELSO [on monitor] Small enough to bring it aboard, sir, if you want to  risk it.  More like destroyed the ship in this case. Look at it. Burnt,  pitted.  He played most illogically. His next move should have been the  rook. [Bridge] The tapes are burnt out. Trying the memory banks.  Getting something from the recorder now.  Decoding memory banks. I'll try to interpolate. The Valiant had  encountered a magnetic space storm and was being swept in this  direction.  Swept past this point, about a half light year out of the  galaxy, they were thrown clear, turned, and headed back into the galaxy  here. I'm not getting it all. The tapes are pretty badly burned. Sounds  like the ship had encountered some unknown force. Now, orders, counter  orders, repeated urgent requests for information from the ship's  computer records for anything concerning ESP in human beings.  Severe damage. Seven crewmen dead. No, make that six. One  crewman seemed to have recovered. That's when they became interested in  extrasensory perception. More than interested, almost frantic about it.  No, this must be garbled. I get something about destruct. I must have  read it wrong. It sounded like the captain giving an order to destroy  his own ship.  Force field of some kind.  Sensor beam on.  Deflectors full intensity.  Deflectors say there's something there, sensors say there isn't.  Density negative. Radiation negative. Energy negative.  Negative!  Damage control reports, all stations!  Main engines are out, sir. We're on emergency power cells.  Casualties, nine dead.  I think we've found that answer, Doctor.  Before the Valiant was destroyed, its captain was frantically  searching for ESP information on his crew.  Are there not also those who seem to see through solid objects,  cause fires to start spontaneously?  Doctor Dehner is speaking of normal ESP power.  He's reading even faster now than just a few  moments ago. Is that Gary Mitchell, the one you used to know?  Our subject is not Gary Mitchell. Our concern is, rather, what  he is mutating into.  Have you noted evidence of unusual powers?  And on my monitor screen I could see Mitchell smiling each time  it happened, as if this ship and crew were almost a toy for his  amusement.  In less time than that, he will have attained powers we can't  understand and can't cope with. Soon we'll be not only useless to him,  but actually an annoyance.  We'll never reach an Earth base with him aboard, Jim. You heard  the mathematics of it. In a month he'll have as much in common with us  as we'd have with a ship full of white mice.  Recommendation one. There's a planet a few light days away from  here. Delta Vega. It has a lithium cracking station. We may be able to  adapt some of its power packs to our engines.  It is the only possible way to get Mitchell off this ship.  Then you have one other choice. Kill Mitchell while you still  can.  It is your only other choice, assuming you make it while you  still have time.  The captain of the Valiant probably felt the same way, and he  waited too long to make his decision. I think we've both guessed that.  He's regaining consciousness.  [Delta Vega Brig] Fighting the force field drained his strength, for a while at  least. He could be handled now.  He tried to get through the force field again. His eyes changed  back faster. He didn't become as weak.  Because she feels. I don't. All I know is logic. In my opinion  we'll be lucky if we can repair this ship and get away in time.  If he should try to stop us  I felt for him, too. 
Request you come to the Bridge, Captain.  Something quite extraordinary. 
Bridge to Captain Kirk.  The aircraft has completely broken up, Captain. Shall we  turn off the tractor beam?  Bridge to Captain Kirk.  Have some new information regarding Captain Christopher.  Important I see you both immediately.  Yes, sir. Bridge out. 
Odd. The expression on that man's face. The mindlessness. Vacant  contentment.  Evidently they're not prepared to deal with out right  disobedience. How did you know?  Your analysis seems logical.  Fascinating. This is merely a hollow tube, Captain. No  mechanism.  Totally illogical. Yesterday, without apparent cause or reason,  they wrought total havoc. Yet today, now  Telepathy, Captain.  (The people pick up weapons from the debris in the street.)  Amazing in this culture.  It took a very advanced technology to construct a device like  this. Inconsistent with this environment  Strong power generations, Captain. Near here, but radiating in  all directions.  An underground? How are you organised?  Powerful enough to destroy a starship? Affirmative.  Captain.  Sensor beams, very strong. We're being probed. In this  direction.  Block them out.  Too strong, Captain. Can't be blocked.  Projection, Captain. Unreal.  He doesn't hear you, Captain.  Where's Doctor McCoy?  I should say they've been here and been removed.  Evidently a maximum security establishment. Are you armed?  The natural result of being subjected to a hypersonic.  Sound waves. Stronger, they might have killed us. As it was,  they merely rendered us unconscious.  We shouldn't depend on that happening again, Captain. In a  society as well organised as this one seems to be, I cannot conceive of  such an oversight going uncorrected. Interesting, however. Their  reaction to your defiance was remarkably similar to the reaction of a  computer when fed insufficient or contradictory data.  Quite human, Captain. It's simply that all the facts are not yet  in. There are gaps.  (The door opens, and a Lawgiver escorts McCoy and O'Neil in, then  leaves them again.)  Like Sulu.  You've been corrected, Captain. You'd better go.  Doctor McCoy, what will happen to him?  Impossible. He's under extremely powerful control.  Little else we can do, unless you can think of a way to get  through that door.  And apparently commanding powers far beyond our comprehension.  Not simple, not ridiculous. Very, very dangerous.  (The door opens and this time the stave is pointed at Spock.)  What about the Captain?  We are not Archons, Marplon.  Where is Reger?  Who is Landru?  Joy be with you. Peace and contentment. [Prison] Captain.  Quite all right. Be careful of Doctor McCoy.  I am formulating a theory, Captain.  Not here. The doctor.  This is a soulless society, Captain. It has no spirit, no spark.  All is indeed peace and  tranquillity. The peace of the factory, the tranquillity of the  machine. All parts working in unison.  Until new orders are received. The question is, who gives those  orders?  There is no Landru, Captain, not in the human sense.  Sir?  Captain, our Prime Directive of non-interference.  Captain.  Spock to Enterprise. status report. [Bridge] Report, Scott. [Bridge] Captain. (gives him a phaser)  KIRK; All right. About Landru.  Useless, Captain. A projection.  A machine. This whole society is a machine's concept of  perfection. Peace, harmony.  The good of the Body, Captain. That's the key.  Are you aiding the body, or are you destroying it?  Not necessary, Captain. They have no guidance. Possibly for the  first time in their lives.  Then the body dies. Creativity is necessary for the health of  the Body.  What's left of him, after he built and programmed this machine  six thousand years ago.  Marvellous.  The late Landru, Captain. A marvellous feat of engineering. A  computer capable of directing the lives of millions of human beings.  Predictably metaphysical. I prefer the concrete, the graspable,  the provable.  That is very kind of you, Captain.  How often mankind has wished for a world as peaceful and secure  as the one Landru provided. 
In view of code seven-ten, Captain, may I suggest  We know very little about them. Their  civilisation is advanced. They've had space flight for several  centuries, but they've never ventured beyond their own solar system.  When first contacted more than fifty years ago, Eminiar Seven was at  war with its nearest neighbour.  The Earth expedition making the report failed to return from its  mission. The USS Valiant. Listed as missing in space.  Transporter room standing by, Captain.  We've selected a site which from the traffic seems to be near an  official establishment.  No hostility directed toward us. No apparent notice taken of us  at all, which seems strange. They did scan us when we assumed orbit.  Obviously, they know we're here.  Screens down, but all defensive details on general alert status,  Captain.  Sir, we have completely scanned your planet. We find it highly  advanced, prosperous in a material sense, comfortable for your people,  and peaceful in the extreme. Yet you say you are at war. There is no  evidence of this.  With whom are you at war?  Strange.  Are these attacks frequent?  None, Captain. Yeoman Tamula.  Tricorder readings. Radiation. Disturbances of any kind.  (She scans the area)  Computers, Captain. They fight their war with computers.  Totally.  Then the attack by Vendikar was theoretical.  There is a certain scientific logic about it.  I do not approve. I understand.  Limited telepathic abilities are inherent in Vulcanians,  Captain. It may work. It may not.  My pleasure, Captain.  I understand.  An entrance, Captain, but no exit. They go in, but they do not  come out.  So I would assume.  (They move forward carefully and meet - )  Sir, there's a multi-legged creature crawling on your shoulder.  (He neck-pinches him, as the rest just stare. They now have two  weapons. Spock rejoins Kirk.)  We captured four of their disrupter-type weapons, two complete  outfits of male clothing, and perhaps most important of all, one of  their communication devices.  Not at this time. Its range is restricted in comparison with  ours. I may be able to alter its components, but it will take time.  Spock to Enterprise, come in. [Bridge] Is the ship all right?  The Captain is overdue. We've suffered no casualties among us.  This is important. Under no circumstances shall any one beam down from  the Enterprise. They'd be killed the moment they arrived. [Bridge] The Ambassador? [Bridge] Orbit out to maximum phaser range and stand  by for further orders. Spock out.  Find the Ambassador and the Captain. Yeoman Tamula, you stay  here and prevent this young lady from immolating herself. Knock her  down if necessary. This is a killing situation. Do what you must to  protect yourself. Clear?  Please, Mister Fox. Ladies and gentlemen, please move quickly  away from the chamber or you may be injured.  Practicing a peculiar variety of diplomacy, sir.  (He uses the disrupter to destroy the disintegration chamber)  I'll take you to a place of comparative safety, then I must find  the Captain.  By now, Mister Ambassador, I'm sure you realise that normal  diplomatic procedures are ineffective here.  Very well, sir. We need all the help we can get. [Council Room] I had assumed you needed help. I see I'm in error.  At the moment contact is broken, it abrogates the agreement  between the two warring parties.  This one's the key. The circuit is now locked. Destroy this one,  and they'll all go.  There's a chance it may work, Captain.  Captain, you took a big chance.  A feeling is not much to go on.  Captain, you almost make me believe in luck. 
Attention. The following personnel report to transporter  room. Engineering Officer Scott, Lieutenant McGivers. Acknowledge.  Anesthesia gas in all sections except Engineering. Someone  just closed that line. [Engineering] (Khan is working controls and listening to the  intercom messages.)  Captain, acknowledge. Unable to flood Engineering section.  I suspect  Negative. We must retake the vessel while the anesthesia  lasts. Meet me in the Armoury. I'm blowing it clear first. Spock out.  (Kirk dashes into Engineering and straight into Khan, who easily  disarms him then crushes the phaser. Then an alarm beeps.) 
Absolutely none, Captain. Berthold rays are such a recent  discovery. We do not yet have full knowledge of their nature. It is  known, however, that living animal tissue disintegrates under exposure.  Sandoval's group could not have survived after three years.  I am saying they knew there was a risk.  The breakdown of tissue does not develop immediately. We can  risk a limited exposure.  Captain, this planet is being bombarded by Berthold rays, as our  reports indicated. At this intensity, we'll be safe for a week if  necessary. But  There's also no question of the fact that Berthold rays are  incontrovertibly deadly. There's no miracle connected with it, Doctor,  you know that. No cures, no serums, no antidotes. If a man is exposed  long enough, he dies.  Spock here, Captain. There seems to be a  total absence of life on the planet, with the exception of the  colonists and various types of flora.  Not at the moment, sir. I am conducting various tests with the  tricorder, but results are inconclusive. [Drawing room] Nothing. Not even insects. Yet your plants grow, and you've  survived exposure to Berthold rays.  Please do.  I have never understood the female capacity to avoid a direct  answer to any question.  I would like to know how your people have managed to survive  here.  Logically, you should all be dead.  Emotions are alien to me. I'm a scientist.  You've not yet explained the nature of this thing.  What you're describing was once known in the vernacular as a  happiness pill. And you, as a scientist, should know that that's not  possible.  Spores?  (One of the pink flowers shoots things at him. Spock clutches his head  and falls to the ground in pain.)  No.  No, I can't. Please, don't!  I am not like you.  (Suddenly the pain is gone.)  I love you. I can love you.  (They kiss.)  Captain's log, supplemental. We have been ordered  by Starfleet Command to evacuate the colony on Omicron Three. However,  the colony leader, Elias Sandoval, has refused all co-operation and  will not listen to any arguments.  [Farmyard] That one looks like a dragon. You see the tail and the dorsal  spines?  I have. On Berengaria Seven. But I've never stopped to look at  clouds before. Or rainbows. You know, I can tell you exactly why one  appears in the sky, but considering its beauty has always been out of  the question.  Yes, what did you want? [Farmyard] Yes, Captain. What did you want?  I don't believe I want to tell you. [Farmyard] No, I don't think so. [Farmyard] I don't think so, sir. [Farmyard] I didn't want to, Jim.  There'll be no evacuation, Jim, but perhaps we should go back  and get you straightened out.  Very well. Come with me.  (He takes Leila's hand and leads the group to a clump of the plants,  where they all get sprayed with spores.)  Mister Sulu understands, don't you, Mister Sulu?  I can see the Captain is going to be difficult. [Another pasture] (No equipment or colonists now, just plants going  up to the ship.)  Almost the entire ship's complement has beamed down.  He went off to create something called a mint julep. That's a  drink, Jim.  It's impossible to say. They drifted through space until they  finally landed here. You see, they actually thrive on Berthold rays.  The plants act as a repository for thousands of microscopic spores  until they find a human body to inhabit.  It's a true Eden, Jim. There's belonging and love.  You don't understand, Jim, but you'll come around sooner or  later. Join us. Please.  Yes, Jim. What is it now? [Bridge] Wonderful, Jim. When will you beam down? [Bridge] Good. Leila and I will meet you at the beam  down point.  Spock here.  What's keeping you, Jim? We've been waiting. [Transporter room] Do you want me to beam up a party? [Transporter room] Just a moment. It won't take long. Do you  mind?  Ready to beam up, Jim. [Transporter room] The term half-breed is somewhat applicable, but computerised is  inaccurate. A machine can be computerised, not a man.  Jim, I don't understand.  Captain, if you'll excuse me.  My mother was a teacher. My father an ambassador.  Captain, please don't  That's enough.  You did that to me deliberately.  The spores. They're gone. I don't belong anymore.  That may be correct, Captain, but trying to initiate a brawl  with over five hundred crewmen and colonists is hardly logical.  It can be done.  Captain. Striking a fellow officer is a court martial offence.  That is quite logical, Captain. [Field] Enterprise. Spock here. [Field] Yes. Yes. I'm quite well. [Field] Are you still at the beam down point, and is the doctor there? [Field] Give your communicator back to Doctor McCoy.  You won't need it to beam up. It'll take a few moments. Just wait  there. Out.  I'll be back shortly, Captain. [Transporter room] (Once she's materialised she rushes to put her arms  around him, but he doesn't respond.)  It was necessary.  I can't.  I have a responsibility to this ship, to that man on the Bridge.  I am what I am, Leila, and if there are self-made purgatories, then we  all have to live in them. Mine can be no worse than someone else's.  (wiping away her tears) You couldn't pronounce it. [Bridge] They'll not hear this, of course. It'll be  more a sensation of feeling it.  Precisely. It should begin to work on their nerves in a few  minutes. [Field]  Enterprise. Spock here. [Pasture] Just a moment. They're all beginning to call  in, Captain. Rather contritely, I should say. Sandoval wishes to speak  to you.  I have little to say about it, Captain, except that for the  first time in my life I was happy. <Back  to the episode listing Star  Trek ® is copyright of  CBS  Studios Inc.

Captain, the security officers have gathered in Chief  Vanderberg's office.  Indeed? I find that most illuminating, Captain. [Tunnel] Only a theory I have.  (We see something move a roof support, and rocks fall near Kirk.)  [Tunnel] The creature is in this area. I'll take  a lifeform reading.  Kill it. 
Captain, we've reached the designated  position for scanning the coded directive tape.  Strategically sound. Organia is the only Class M planet in the  disputed area, ideally located for use by either side.  Inhabited by humanoids. A very peaceful, friendly people living  on a primitive level. Little of intrinsic value. Approximately Class D  minus on Richter's scale of cultures.  Sir?  We've hit him, Captain. He's hurt.  Minor, Captain. We were most fortunate. Blast damage in decks  ten and eleven, minor buckling in the antimatter pods, casualties very  light.  Yes. It would seem to be an unfriendly act.  Curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do  not want.  With the outbreak of hostilities, that might not be easy.  Negotiating with the Organians will be time-consuming, Captain,  and time is one thing we'll have the least of.  Yes. Curious lack of interest. Notice the ruins in the distance,  Captain. Quite large.  Whatever it is, it would seem to be inconsistent with the  reports we've been given on this culture.  (A man in a loose purple robe opens his arms wide.)  It would seem so.  Captain, if you don't mind, I should like to wander about the  village and make some studies.  Captain, our information on these people and their culture was  not correct. This is not a primitive society making progress toward  mechanisation. They are totally stagnant. There is no evidence of any  progress as far back as my tricorder can register.  Nevertheless, it is true. For tens of thousands of years, there  has been absolutely no advancement, no significant change in their  physical environment. This is a laboratory specimen of an arrested  culture.  Negative, Captain, but it seems a logical development.  So it would seem. Not a very pleasant prospect.  Captain, our phasers are gone.  Vulcan merchants are not uncommon, Captain. It is a practical  approach.  I am Spock, a dealer in kevas and trillium.  Perfectly, Baroner. But it was an interesting experience.  Not necessary, Commander. I understand you very well.  (He leaves, followed by the guard.)  It should not be underestimated, Captain. It reaches directly  into the mind. We Vulcans have certain mental (a Klingon walks past)  certain disciplines which enable me to maintain a shield. Without those  disciplines, there would be no protection.  I'm sorry, sir. We did not notice you.  Captain, I strongly suggest we direct our energies toward the  immediate problem. Accomplishing our mission here.  I thought you might.  We'll receive no help from the Organians.  Verbal persuasion seems to be ineffective. Perhaps a more direct  approach?  You did.  A very meritorious idea, Captain.  I'm certain the Klingons will provide whatever is necessary.  It's a pleasure doing business with you, Mister Spock. [Kor's Headquarters] (Kirk jumps one Klingon and hauls his unconscious  body away. Spock primes a grenade, presumably from the munitions dump.)    With a delayed action fuse.  KIRK; Good.  These crates contain chemical explosives. They should make a  most satisfactory display.  (He casually drops the grenade into a box, and they run.)  Six, five, four three.  (There's a short but bright fireworks show.)  Our fleet will eventually arrive. In the meantime, the battle is  ours. It can be a successful one.  It's no use, Jim. There's no way out.  (Later.)  Six hours, forty three minutes, if the Klingons are punctual.  They do not seem to understand. Most peculiar.  We may not get the chance, Captain. These walls are very thick.  Nor do we understand what happened to the guard at the citadel.  Indeed, there are several questions I would like to ask as well.    It would appear so, Captain.  But only two. More Organians will die.  Difficult to be precise, Captain. I should say approximately  7,824.7 to 1.  7,824.7 to 1.  I endeavour to be accurate.  Very good.  Clear, Captain.  Less than seven thousand to one, Captain. It's remarkable we've  got this far.  (taking his weapon) I believe you'll find that several of them  are no longer in perfect operating condition.  You may be premature. There are many possibilities.  Inexplicable, Captain. Extreme heat. Not only the weapons but  the bodies as well.  (Ayelborne and Claymare come in.)  Fascinating. Pure energy. Pure thought. Totally incorporeal. Not  life as we know it at all.  Conventionalisations, I should say. Useless to the Organians.  Created so that visitors such as ourselves, could have conventional  points of reference.  We have seen it with our own eyes. I should say the Organians  are as far above us on the evolutionary scale as we are above the  amoeba.  You've been most restrained since we left  Organia.  Captain, it took millions of years for the Organians to evolve  into what they are. Even the gods did not spring into being overnight.  You and I have no reason to be embarrassed. We did, after all, beat the  odds. 
I believe we'll have them plotted in a few more orbits, Captain.    (Sulu's console explodes and he is thrown to the floor, unconscious.)  This is of great scientific importance, Captain. We're actually  passing through ripples in time.  All plotted but one, Captain. Coming up on it now. Seems to be  fairly heavy displacement.  (And they hit it just as McCoy still has the hypo in his hand, and the  jolt results in him injecting it into his own stomach.)  The hypo, Captain.  Empty.  Confirmed by the library record tapes, Captain. Subjects failed  to recognise acquaintances, became hysterically convinced that they  were in mortal danger, and were seeking escape at any cost. Extremely  dangerous to himself or to anyone else who might  And the transporter at that time, Captain, was focused on the  centre of the time disturbance.  And of considerable age. On the order of ten thousand centuries  old.  Unbelievable, Captain.  This single object is the source of all the time displacement.  I can't. For this to do what it does is impossible by any  science I understand. It is operating even now. Putting out waves and  waves of time displacement, which we picked up millions of miles away.  Incredible power. It can't be a machine as we understand  mechanics.  I see no reason for answers to be couched in riddles.  A time portal, Captain. A gateway to other times and dimensions,  if I'm correct.  Really.  Relive the accident. This time be certain that the hypo accident  is avoided. Look at the speed with which the centuries are passing,  Captain. To step through on precisely the day we wish  I am a fool. My tricorder is capable of recording even at this  speed. I've missed taping centuries of living history which no man  before has ever  (But McCoy has woken up, and dashes towards the Guardian.)  With no past, no future.  I was recording images at the time McCoy  left. A rather barbaric period in your American history. I believe I  can approximate just when to jump. Perhaps within a month of the  correct time. A week, if we're fortunate.  There is no alternative.  Seconds now, sir. Stand by.  And now. [Street] (They leap through a wall with a poster for boxing  at Madison Square Gardens. Welcome to the Depression.)  It was called Depression, circa 1930. Quite barbaric.  (Two women give then curious looks, and Spock hides his ears with his  hands.)  I'm afraid I'm going to be difficult to explain in any case,  Captain.  That should prove interesting.  Fascinating.  Theft, Captain?  You were saying you'll have no trouble explaining it.  Perhaps the unfortunate accident I had as a child.  Oh, yes, it's quite untidy. Here, let me help you.  (And a quick neck pinch in front of witnesses, then they grab the  clothes and run off. With whistles blowing, they duck down the alley  beside the 21st Street Mission and down the stairs to the cellar.)  [Cellar] Captain, I hardly believe that insults are within your  prerogative as my commanding officer.  First, I believe we have about a week before McCoy arrives, but  we can't be certain.  There is a theory. There could be some logic to the belief that  time is fluid, like a river, with currents, eddies, backwash.  Unless that is true, Captain, we have no hope. Frustrating.  Locked in here is the place and moment of his arrival, even the images  of what he did. If only I could tie this tricorder in with the ship's  computers for just a few moments.  In this zinc-plated vacuum-tubed culture?  At what rate of payment? I need radio tubes and so forth. My  hobby.  Yes, of course, Captain.  Speculation. Gifted insight.  We have a what, Captain?  One might have said so in the first place. [Room] (It must be some days later, because Spock has  already built a 50's horror movie contraption, complete with static  electricity running between two vertical wires. Kirk enters with  groceries and turns the whining thing off.)  Captain, I must have some platinum. A small block would be  sufficient, five or six pounds. By passing certain circuits through  there to be used as a duodynetic field core...  Captain, you're asking me to work with equipment which hardly  very far ahead of stone knives and bearskins.  Captain. Captain, in three weeks at this rate, possibly a month,  I might reach the first mnemonic memory circuits.  (There's a knock at the door.)  I am endeavouring, ma'am, to construct a mnemonic memory circuit  using stone knives and bearskins. [Canteen] (Kirk and Spock are sweeping the floor, with the  chairs stacked on the tables, and two men repairing clocks.)  Captain. Tools for finely detailed work.  (Later, a combination padlock is being opened by someone with very  sensitive ears.) [Cellar] (Spock is stoking the boiler when Edith comes in to  confront them.)  I needed the fine tools for my radio work. They'd have been  returned in the morning.  Interesting. Where would you estimate we belong, Miss Keeler?  I'll finish with the furnace.  I may have found our focal point in time.  Yes. I'm overloading those lines. I believe we'll have our  answer on this screen, Captain.  And, Captain, you may find this a bit distressing.  I've slowed down the recording we made from the time vortex.  Bad enough.  It would seem unlikely, Jim. A few moments ago, I read a 1930  newspaper article.  Or Captain, Edith Keeler will die this year. I saw her obituary.  Some sort of traffic accident.  Captain, Edith Keeler is the focal point in time we've been  looking for, the point that both we and Doctor McCoy have been drawn  to.  Is the random element.  Or perhaps he prevents her from being killed. We don't know  which.  Captain, suppose we discover that in order to set things  straight again, Edith Keeler must die? [Street] (The man from the canteen steals a milk bottle from  a doorstep when McCoy leaps in through Singers Book Store window and  starts shouting.)  I'll need at least two more days before I dare make another  attempt.  Captain, our last bit of information was obtained at the expense  of thirty hours work in fused and burned circuits.  This is how history went after McCoy changed  it. Here, in the late 1930s. A growing pacifist movement whose  influence delayed the United States' entry into the Second World War.  While peace negotiations dragged on, Germany had time to complete its  heavy-water experiments.  Because all this lets them develop the A-bomb first. There's no  mistake, Captain. Let me run it again. Edith Keeler. Founder of the  peace movement.  She was right, but at the wrong time. With the A-bomb, and with  their V2 rockets to carry them, Germany captured the world.  And all this because McCoy came back and somehow kept her from  dying in a street accident as she was meant to. We must stop him, Jim.  We can estimate general happenings from these images, but I  can't trace down precise actions at exact moments, Captain. I'm sorry.  Jim, Edith Keeler must die. [Mission back room] (McCoy stirs, dislodging the moist towel from his  forehead.)  Captain, I did not plan to eavesdrop.  I must point out that when she stumbled, she might have died  right there, had you not caught her.  We're not that sure of our facts. Who's to say when the exact  time will come? Save her, do as your heart tells you to do, and  millions will die who did not die before. [Mission back room] (McCoy is out of bed.)  What is it?  No, Jim!  He knows, Doctor. He knows. [Planet surface] (Kirk and Spock leap back out of the Guardian.)  We were successful. 
As I speculated, Captain, the overall pattern of mass insanity  destroying civilisations follows an almost straight line through this  section of the galaxy. Over here the Beta Portilin system the ancient  civilisations. Archaeologists have given us information indicating that  they were the beginning. Two hundred years ago, Levinius Five was swept  by mass insanity, then Theta Cygni Twelve. The last was Ingraham B, two  years ago.  The ship is a one-man vessel of Denevan configuration, Captain.  He does not seem to be out of control. His course is straight for the  sun.  Outer hull temperature now four hundred and eighty degrees and  rising.  So are we. Hull temperature one thousand degrees and rising. The  sun's gravimetric pull increasing.  All clear, Captain. Hull temperature falling, gravimetric pull  approaching tolerance level.  Planet development is normal, Captain.  Originally colonised as a freighting-line base in this area.  No Federation contacts for over a year.  Lieutenant Uhura has had no further response to our signals.  Sensors report the expected number of humans on the planet surface.  However, they are strangely quiet. Very little activity.  They're here, Captain. In the buildings. Strangely quiescent.  Captain, several people approaching.  Indeed. They seemed most concerned for our safety.  Their attitude was inconsistent with their actions.  Captain, I understand how you must  Notice the ventilator, Captain. Apparently they were trying to  keep something outside from getting in. Obviously they were not  entirely successful.  That is correct. I am at a loss to understand it.  The streets are extraordinarily quiet, Captain. We've seen no  other Denevans, and the ones we stunned earlier were gone when we came  out.  A peculiar buzzing sound. We were about to investigate it.  Incredible. Not only should it have been destroyed by our  phasers, it does not even register on my tricorder.  It is not life as we know or understand it. Yet t is obviously  alive, it exists.  Captain, I suggest we risk taking it aboard.  No! No! (he sits up)  (hoarsely) No, I won't.  I must take the ship.  (Three of them wrestle him to the floor as Chapel enters and hands a  hypo to McCoy.)  Down! I must take it down.  (McCoy sedates him.)  Doctor McCoy. Captain.  These restraints will no longer be necessary. Nor will your  sedatives, Doctor. I'll be able to return to duty. I apologise for my  weakness earlier when I tried to take control of the ship. I simply did  not understand.  What is there to understand, Mister Spock?  I am a Vulcan, Doctor. Pain is a thing of the mind. The mind can  be controlled.  It is proving to be an inconvenience, but it is manageable. And  the creature, with all of its thousands of parts, even now is  pressuring me. (the pain indicator hits the top of the monitor) It  wants this ship, but I am resisting.  I have my own will, Captain. Let me help.  I am a Vulcan. I am a Vulcan. There is no pain.  (Then he breaks his restraints.)  [Transporter room] I was.  I have an errand on the planet's surface. You will beam me down  to the same co-ordinates as before.  That is an order, Mister Scott.  Until the pain was gone, Captain. It has been discontinued by  me.  One of the creatures will have to be captured and analysed,  Captain. We did not have a clear opportunity to do so earlier when I  was attacked. Since my nervous system is already affected, as you  pointed out, Doctor, I don't believe they can do much more to me.  I am in complete control of myself, Doctor. The fact that I am  here proves that I do not belong in bed.  Thank you, Captain.  Come in, gentlemen. I believe you'll find this interesting.  (McCoy scans Spock.) Doctor, your medical skill and curiosity are quite  admirable, but I assure you I'm all right.  Unimportant at the moment, Doctor. Please observe. Interesting,  gentlemen. A one-celled creature resembling, more than anything else, a  huge, individual brain cell.  Do you understand what I'm suggesting, Captain?  And although it is not physically connected to the other cells,  it is nevertheless part of the whole creature, guided by the whole,  drawing its strength from the whole, which probably accounts for its  unusual resistance to our phaser weapons.  From a place where our physical laws do not apply. We may  therefore find it difficult to destroy, Captain.  Yes, sir.  (Kirk leaves, then McCoy.)  (Later, Chapel is working with McCoy when Kirk enters.)  I regret I see no other choice for you, Captain. We already know  this thing has destroyed three civilisations. Perhaps more.  Including myself, Doctor, and Captain Kirk's young nephew.  Understandably upsetting, but once it spreads past here, there are  dozens of colonies beyond and billions of people.  I therefore request permission to beam down to the planet's  surface. I also suggest that your nephew accompany me.  Captain, I do not make this request lightly. I do not know how  much longer I can hold out against the pain. But I do know what the boy  will go through should he regain consciousness.  It exists physically. It occupies space. It has mass, therefore  gravity. It converts matter to energy.  A possibility.  Yes. In essence, it can be done. A string of satellites around  the planet with burning tri-magnesite and trevium.  Of course. The light of the sun at the proximity where the  Denevan declared himself free was one million candles per square inch.  If this works, the satellites we orbit will produce light of such  intensity that even someone in a closed, darkened area will be affected  by it.  Captain, you'll need a host for the next step in the test to  determine whether the creature can be driven from the body. I am the  logical choice.  There'll be none on the planet's surface, Doctor.  The creature within me is gone. I am free of it and the pain.  (He walks forward, straight into a table.)  And I'm also quite blind. An equitable trade, Doctor. Thank you.    (They help him into a chair, and Chapel rushes in.)  Interesting. Just as dogs are sensitive to certain sounds which  humans cannot hear, these creatures evidently are sensitive to light  which we cannot see.  Doctor it was my selection as well. It is done.  An hereditary trait, Captain. The brightness of the Vulcan sun  has caused the development of an inner eyelid, which acts as a shield  against high-intensity light. Totally instinctive, Doctor. We tend to  ignore it, as you ignore your own appendix.  Quite the contrary, Captain. I had a very strong reaction. My  first sight was the face of Doctor McCoy bending over me.  My pleasure, Captain.  Why, thank you, Doctor McCoy. 
Undetermined. Whatever it is, it's blocking our way. When  we move, it moves as well.  Negative. More some type of device.  Spock here.  Negative. Whatever it is, it seems to just want to hold us  here.  Negative.  Exercise rating, Captain. Ninety four percent.  Agreed.  We're picking up an object, sir. Much larger, coming toward  us. 
They may have nothing to report. Our sensors indicate no life  forms except our landing party.  No cloud formations, no bodies of water, no changes in surface  temperature. Under these conditions, fog is highly unlikely, Captain.  According to our transporter co-ordinates this is the exact location  from which Jackson was beamed up to the ship.  (They step down carefully into the mist swirling along the path.)  No indications of. A moment, Captain. Picking up life form  readings. Twenty four degrees mark seven. Range one thirty seven point  one six metres. Multiple readings, Captain.  No change, Captain.  Very bad poetry, Captain.  What we've just seen is not real.  However, on azimuth twenty four, at just over one hundred  metres, there are definitely life forms. Erratic, confused, but  definitely registering.  This is the source of the life form readings, Captain. They're  inside, somewhere.  I would say not, Captain. There's no indication of anything that  would cause such interference.  Nor do our sensors register the life forms inside.  Trick or treat, Captain?  That would seem to be in order.  The readings would so indicate.  (Unlike a real castle, this one is all corridors at present.)  Yes. I am undamaged, Captain.  I do not know, Captain, but these things do exist. They are  real.  As if someone knew what it was that terrifies man most on an  instinctive level.  Neither did Jackson just before he collapsed.  Mapping expeditions have charted this solar system before. There  never have been any life forms on Pyris Seven.  There are ancient Earth legends about wizards and their  familiars.  Demons in animal forms sent by Satan to serve the wizard.  I do not create the legend, Captain. I merely report it.  Ingenious.  Mind probing? Hypnosis?  Telepathy?  Not entirely, no. Telepathy doesn't imply control and I assure  you that I have full control over your friends.  (Kirk gets the phaser off Scott by throwing gems in his face.)  Twenty two minutes, seventeen seconds.  I'm sure we'll find out shortly. Jim, all of these things that  we've seen. To an Earthman like yourself, they must seem quite  familiar.  Precisely. I refer you to the psychological theory of the racial  subconscious. The universal myths, symbols.  And dungeons and castles and black cats. They all belong to the  twilight world of consciousness.  And they missed. They reached basically only the subconscious.  Korob seemed  puzzled by your reaction to the environment he'd provided.  And not to have a knowledge of our scientific methods is most  unlikely for any life form we've met in this galaxy.  Evidently something totally alien in all respects.  I, too, am at a loss at this time to suggest a course of action.    (The door opens and McCoy enters with Scott and Sulu. He has been  zombified. Sulu unchains Kirk.)  You came in a ship?  Fascinating.  Racial memories. The cat is the most ruthless, most terrifying  of animals, as far back as the sabre-toothed tiger.  Ready when you are, Captain.  Quickly, Captain.  Captain, a bit more alacrity, if you please.  (Kirk uses a bed frame as a trampoline to help him reach the hole, and  Spock pulls him the rest of the way.)  [Castle] Captain.  (McCoy arrives to take a swing at them with a morning-star. Kirk fights  with him as Spock takes on Scott. Kirk knocks McCoy out.)  Jim!  (McCoy has awakened only to get knocked out again.)  Fortuitous, Captain. And now that we have them all together?  (the cat arrives) A most unpleasant situation, Captain. If only your  phaser had some power.  Don't let her touch the wand, Captain.  (She strokes her pendant, and she and Kirk vanish.)  Jim! [Drawing room] Fascinating. A life form totally alien to our galaxy. If we  could preserve and study this  (But the little puppets collapse and die. Smoke rises from the bodies.) 
We have reached projected point three, Captain. Adjust to new  course two oh one mark one five.  Captain.  Will you check your automatic scanner, please?  Nor have I.  (They lower the central shutter to view the approaching swirly flashing  thing.)  Heading directly toward us at warp speed.  Vaguely like a cloud of ionised hydrogen, but with strong  erratic electrical impulses.  (Sounds of electrical shorts. The lights flicker.)  Helm does not answer, Captain.  Cut, Captain.  Now on course nine eight mark one two, heading directly toward  Gamma Canaris region.  Gravity is similar to Earth. Most unusual in view of its size.  The bulk of the body seems to be iron and nickel. More than an  asteroid. Like a small planetoid, I should say. Possibly a remnant of a  planet breakup. Totally suitable for human life.  Most unusual. Unlikely. In fact, Captain, I would say quite  impossible.  Precisely.  Obviously.  The ionised cloud.  Fascinating.  Correct.  Which seems to be on the surface of this body at the moment.  You say we'll be unable to get the ship to function again?  You don't mind if we continue to try?  You built this, Mister Cochrane?  Not bad.  Captain, Doctor.  (From the doorway, the three see a swirly thing which then disappears.  Cochrane comes in with a tray of drinks.)  We imagined nothing, Mister Cochrane. There was an entity out  there and I suspect it was the same entity which brought us here.  Please explain.  You were injured?  I prefer to reserve judgment on that part of your story, sir.  Meanwhile, would you please explain exactly what this Companion of  yours is?  The name of Zefram Cochrane is revered throughout the known  galaxy. Planets were named after him. Great universities, cities.  True, his body was never found.  If so, you wear your age very well.  Captain. These instruments, they date from the time indicated.  From your ship, Mister Cochrane?  You ask me to find a weapon. Do you intend to destroy it?  Quite clear, Captain.  Yes. Quite all right, Doctor. A most fascinating thing happened.  Apparently, the Companion imparted to me a rather quaint, old-fashioned  electric shock of respectable voltage.  Evidently. Unquestionably, a large part of its substance is  simple electricity.  Quite correct, Doctor. [Cochrane's home] (Spock is demonstrating the device he has put on  the table.)  Put this in the proximity of the Companion, throw this switch,  and it will scramble every electrical impulse the creature can produce.  It cannot fail.  We may simply render it powerless.  There is some risk, Captain. We do not know the extent of its  powers.  All right.  (They go to the doorway and see the Companion with Cochrane again.)  Yes, Captain?  The translator is for use with more congruent life forms.  It is possible. If I could widen its pattern of reception  Then it translates its findings into English.  Quite ready, Captain.  Yes. The matter of gender could change the entire situation.  Then it is not a zookeeper.  This is a marvellous opportunity to add to our knowledge. Ask it  about its nature, its history.  A chance like this may never come again. It could tell us so  much.  Her attitude when she approaches you is profoundly different  than when she contacts us. Her appearance is soft, gentle. Her voice is  melodic, pleasing. I do not totally understand the emotion, but it  obviously exists. The Companion loves you.  Your highly emotional reaction is most illogical. Your  relationship with the Companion has for one hundred and fifty years  been emotionally satisfying,  eminently practical, and totally harmless. It may indeed have been  quite beneficial.  Fascinating. A totally parochial attitude.  But she or it is inhuman, Captain. You cannot expect her to  react like a human.  Companion, you do not have the power to create life.  Commissioner Hedford was dying.  Then you are both here, in the one body?  Not coming from a human being. You are, after all, essentially  irrational.  But you will age, both of you. There will be no immortality.  You'll both grow old here and finally die. 
Ordinarily, under these circumstances, I would recommend a  large, well-armed landing party.  He also mentioned that they can be highly dangerous.  Inefficient, however. Emotion, Captain.  It would appear, Captain, that he finds you a disappointment. [Teer's tent] (A middle-aged man sits on a throne, surrounded by  his guards.)  Our check-in signal is one hour, twelve minutes overdue. Since  no reconnaissance party has appeared, and since Mister Scott is notably  efficient in such matters  That would seem a logical conclusion.  Yes, Captain, an excellent idea.  But a defensible entrance, Captain.  The walls get higher and narrower, but there is a way out.  There is enough loose rock and shale.  Only a very slight chance it would work.  Captain, I didn't say that exactly.  (The Capellans are getting close to the canyon entrance.)  The sound beams should produce a sympathetic vibration on the  weak area of that slide.  (The party is led by Maab, who senses something is wrong but keeps  coming forward until the  rock face explodes. Kras hides but other Capellans are crushed by the  falling boulders. When the dust starts to clear, Kras takes the  Federation phasers from a wounded Capellan then kills him with his own  knife. The remaining members of the posse move on.)  There would seem to be little weapon potential at hand.  Fortunately, this bark has suitable tensile cohesion.  I believe I said that.  (A baby cries offscreen.)  I would rather, I would rather not. Thank you.  That should prove very interesting. [Bridge] The child?  Virtue is a relative term, Doctor. She'll head straight to the  warriors.  Here, Captain. Over here, Captain. (into communicator as Kirk  joins him.) Spock to Enterprise.  If by that you mean we can't expect help from the Enterprise, I  must agree.  The Klingon?  Revenge, Captain?  Oochy-woochy coochy-coo, Captain?  Well, at any rate, this should prove interesting.  When the woman starts explaining how the new high teer is  actually Doctor McCoy's child.  Nor does Doctor McCoy.  Oochy-woochy coochy-coo. Oochy-woochy coochy-coo. [Bridge] The child's regent?  The child was named Leonard James Akaar?  I think you're both going to be insufferably pleased with  yourselves for at least a month, sir. 
We've pinpointed a power source on the planet's surface  which seems to have something to do with the force field. [Bridge] The power emanates from there.  Spock, Captain. [Bridge] Captain, you're too close. 
What is this?  (The door to his quarters opens and Chapel rushes out with a scream,  just before the soup bowl hits the opposite wall.)  Poking and prying! If I want anything from you, I'll ask  for it!  (Everyone stops and stares as he come to his door.) 
Enterprise, Spock here.  Spock here, Captain. [Bridge] Attempting to remedy.  Red alert! Red alert!  No evidence of life, subspace  interference level incredibly high.  I also believe the nature of this  machine precludes the possibility of easy access to its control  mechanisms. [Bridge] Acknowledged. [Transporter room] Transporter Room, stand by to beam  landing party aboard.  Damage in communications, Captain.  Interference will (static)  At least one solar day. [Bridge] Yes, sir.  Captain Kirk, come in please.  Captain? [Bridge] Correct. [Bridge] There's another factor, Captain. The transporter is not  working at one hundred percent efficiency. [Bridge] Transporter, stand by.  Acknowledged. [Jefferies tube] (Amid spluttering cables)  Mister Scott, speed is of the essence. [Bridge] We can't, Captain. Transporter is out again. [Bridge] Mister Scott? [Bridge] Try inverse phasing. [Bridge] Mister Scott? 
Spock here, Captain. May I have a word with you? 
Captain. They will not answer. The long-range sensor sweep of  this system reveals no sign of life.  I register no life readings at all, sir.  We would have known in advance of any system-wide catastrophe,  and in the event of an interplanetary war, there would be considerable  radioactive residue. Our instruments show only normal background  radiation.  Unknown, sir. Sensor readings would have revealed the presence  of any disease organisms. They do not. In addition, we received the  routine report from this system only a week ago. Even the Symbalene  blood burn does not act that swiftly.  An extremely powerful bolt of energy, Captain.  Temporarily, Captain. Our shields absorbed energy equivalent to  ninety of our photon torpedoes.  I may add, the energy used repulsing this first attack reduced  our shielding power twenty percent.  We can resist three more such attacks. The fourth will shatter  our shields completely.  Approximately warp fifteen, Captain.  Unknown, Captain. Nothing within sensor range. (a third bolt  approaching) Something now, Captain. Very small. Bearing one two three  degrees, mark one eight. Range ninety thousand kilometres.  No, sir. Holding steady.  No effect. Target absorbed full energy of our torpedo.  They are in good working order, Captain.  Captain, shields are down. We cannot survive another hit.  Computing now, Captain. Weight, five hundred kilograms. Shape,  roughly cylindrical. Length, a fraction over one metre.  Intelligence does not necessarily require bulk, Mister Scott.  Captain, this message is a sort of binary. Extremely  sophisticated, compressed, carrying several channels at once.  No clue as yet, Captain. A moment. Transmission speed has  stepped down. Much slower. Seems to be a single binary.  Fascinating.  It would seem so, Captain.  It's a formula, Captain. They're sending us a mathematical  message and requesting language equivalence. They're trying to  communicate.  Cut power, Lieutenant. Overloaded and burned out.  Nomad?  Negative, Captain. It has a protective screen. I cannot get  through.  A reasonable course.  It is reacting much like a highly sophisticated computer.  An opinion is a belief, a view, a judgment.  Yes. It was reported destroyed. There were no more in the  series. But if this is that probe  Chart 14A, sir?  I believe the history computer can answer that question. I'll  have the readout in a moment.  The usage is correct. The creator was simply testing your memory  banks.  I've correlated all the available information on the Nomad  probe, and I'm convinced that this object is indeed that probe.  True.  Presumed destroyed by a meteor collision. I submit that it was  badly damaged and somehow managed to repair itself.  This is the creator of Nomad, perhaps the  most brilliant though erratic scientist of his time. His dream was to  build a perfect thinking machine, capable of independent logic. You  recall his name.  Yes. Similar. Captain, I believe that Nomad thinks you are  Roykirk. That may well be why the attack was broken off. It responded  to your name as well as its damaged memory banks permitted.  Essentially it is, Doctor. I believe that more happened to it  than just damage in the meteor collision. It mentioned the other. The  unanswered question is, the other what?  Nomad was a thinking machine, the best that could be engineered. It was  a prototype.  Precisely, Doctor. And somehow that programming has been  changed. It would seem that Nomad is now seeking out perfect  life-forms, perfection being measured by its own relentless logic.  Captain, Mister Singh reports that Nomad is no longer in the  auxiliary control room.  That unit is a woman.  Nomad, I have arranged the tapes for flash feed at the top speed  of the computer. Please do not draw the information faster than the  machine's capacity.  Fascinating.  Well, Doctor?  Captain, if that is correct, if there has been no brain damage  but only knowledge erased, she could be re-educated.  Does the creator wish Nomad to wait elsewhere?  Doctor, I interrupted you because Nomad would not have  understood your anger. It has great technical skill, but its reaction  to emotion is unpredictable. It almost qualifies as a life-form.  The study of it would be of great use, Captain.  An almost human stubbornness, Captain. I have been unable to  convince Nomad to lower its screens for analysis. Without its  co-operation, I can do nothing.  Thank you.  It is not sufficient, Captain. I get certain  references to the accident, the other, but nothing clear. There are  areas I simply cannot scan.  Captain, I suggest the Vulcan mind probe.  It seems the only way.  There is a risk, but I have formed a partial hypothesis. I must  check it out.  I. Am. Nomad. I am performing my function. Deep emptiness, It  approaches. Collision. Damage. Blackness. I. Am. The other. I am Tan  Ru, Tan Ru. Nomad. Tan Ru. Error. Flaw. Imperfection. Must sterilise.  Rebirth. We are complete. Much power. Gun ta. Noo. Icka. Tan Ru. The  creator instructs. Search out. Identify. Sterilise imperfections. We  are Nomad.  We are Nomad. We are complete. We are instructed. Our purpose is clear.  Sterilise imperfections. (he lets go of Nomad) Sterilise imperfections.  Nomad. Sterilise. Sterilise. Nomad, sterilise,  Fascinating, Captain. The knowledge. The depth.  It was, it was damaged in deep space. Undoubtedly, the meteor  collision. Its memory banks were destroyed, or most of them. It  wandered without purpose, and then it met the other. The other was an  alien probe of great power. Somehow they merged,  repaired each other, became one.  Not the Nomad we lost from Earth. It took from the other a new  directive to replace its own. The other was originally programmed to  secure and sterilise soil samples from other planets, probably as a  prelude to colonisation.  I beg your pardon?  And that is the only thing that has saved us until now.  Yes.  (They leave. Nomad flies through the forcefield. The two guards fire  their phasers at it but it's screens are back up. Nomad zaps them into  oblivion.)  [Engineering] (Nomad floats in.)  Captain. I've examined the brig. The forcefield door on the  security cell is damaged and the guards have vanished. I must assume  they are dead.  I suspect it is about to re-evaluate its creator. Captain, it  may have been unwise to admit to Nomad that you are a biological unit.  In Nomad's eyes, you must now undoubtedly appear imperfect.  Even worse. Nomad just now made a reference to its launch point,  Earth.  I do not believe there is much beyond Nomad's capabilities.  It will find the Earth infested with imperfect biological units.    No response.  (The doors open and Nomad comes out.  Since it specifically examined your history, I suggest it has  completed its re-evaluation.  Undoubtedly.  Your logic was impeccable, Captain. We are in grave danger.  My congratulations, Captain. A dazzling  display of logic.  No, sir.  Remarkable.  The destruction of Nomad was a great waste, Captain. It was a  remarkable instrument.  Sir? 
The soil here is remarkably rich and fertile, Captain. Husbandry  would be quite efficacious.  Oh, quite sure. Readings indicate the entire planet is covered  with growth like this.  Curious, even at the poles there's very little variation in temperature  which maintains a planet-wide average of seventy six degrees.  I find that most unusual, Captain.  Indeed. Subsurface vibrations for miles in all directions.  Quite strong, fairly regular, artificially produced.  Captain.  There's a humanoid hiding directly behind us, moving with  remarkable agility, bearing one eight.  (Kirk nods to a guard, and they go to flank their observer.)  A visitor. One wanting to retain his anonymity, I should say.  Anything?  Interesting. Extremely low specific gravity, some uraninite,  hornblende, quartz. (breaks it in half) Fragile, good cleavage. An  analysis should prove interesting.  (He throws one half away, and it explodes when it hits the ground.)  Obviously highly unstable, Captain. This could be a find of some  importance. In large quantities, it could be a considerable source of  power.  If Scott is correct about the force from the surface, it may  have to do with the vibrations I read earlier.  If so, an immense one. Probably subterranean.  (McCoy is scanning something.)  (noticing a plant moving) Jim!  (He pushes the Captain and McCoy out of the way, but takes the thorns  in his own chest.)  Doctor McCoy's potion is acting like all his potions, turning my  stomach. Other than that, I am quite well.  I surmised you were unaware of that plant, so I  I assure you, Captain, I had no intention of doing that. It was  merely my own clumsiness prevented me which prevented me from moving  out of the way.  I shall do so.  One hundred twenty two thousand two hundred  Captain, to affect the ship at this extreme range would require  a highly sophisticated planetary defence system.  (It goes dark.)  Captain. Those co-ordinates are a short distance in that  direction.  Captain. In each case, this was unavoidable.  I don't see how.  You are under orders to investigate this planet and this  culture.  No one has ever stated that Starfleet duty was particularly  safe. You've followed the correct and logical course, done everything a  commander could do. Self-recriminations (he pauses) Captain, our friend  is back.  Mister Chekov, your tricorder readings are totally inefficient!  Ensign, I will not have you address me in that tone of voice!  Captain, this is fascinating. If you will permit me, sir?  (Akuta has metal wires sticking out behind from behind his ears.)  Fascinating. A very high order of  workmanship, very ancient, generating great power.  No, Captain. The centre is deep in the earth beneath us. This is  an access point. It would also seem to be a  (He steps forward and is flung back.)  Obviously.  Yes, quite. It extends some thirty feet beyond the figure in all  directions. Conventional in composition, and quite formidable.  Yes, indeed it does, Captain. It makes me uncomfortable.  Yes. Spock. I am Spock.  I fail to see what they find so amusing.  Quite possible. It checks with my atmospheric analysis. Their  atmosphere completely negates any harmful effects from their sun.  Apparently, our hypothesis is correct. There is no living being  there. It is a machine, nothing more.  Evidently not. This is no ordinary machine, Captain. It may well  possess a rudimentary intelligence.  That may not be of any help. The Enterprise has only ten hours  left in which to break free.  Acknowledged.  (McCoy joins them.)  In my view, a splendid example of reciprocity.  Doctor, you insist on applying human standards to non-human  cultures. I remind you that humans are only a tiny minority in this  galaxy.  Another is their right to choose a system which seems to work  for them.  Doctor, these people are healthy and they are happy. What ever  you choose to call it, this system works, despite your emotional  reaction to it.  I see no alternative.  Well, I believe it's safe, (cough) safe to assume that they  would receive the necessary instructions.  I am concerned, Captain. This may not be an  ideal society, but it is a viable one.  If we do what it seems we must, in my opinion it will be in  direct violation of the non-interference directive.  Starfleet Command may think otherwise.  Captain!  Disturbing. The people of Vaal seem to have disappeared. [Vaal] Force field, Captain.  Variation in impulses, Captain. I believe it is reading us. A  strong jump on all wavelengths.  (Lightning threatens.)  Doctor, you have an unsurpassed talent for understatement.  The good doctor was concerned that the Vaalians achieved true  human stature. I submit there is no cause for worry. They've taken the  first step. They've learned to kill. [Bridge] Readings are getting weaker, Captain. Wide  variation in energy transmissions, as though Vaal were trying to draw  on other sources.  I would assume so.  If it had to reinforce its energy field to ward off a phaser  attack, it would have to draw more heavily on its reserves.  A tremendous upsurge in generated power, Captain. Obviously Vaal  is trying to reinforce his energy field.  No power generation at all, Captain. Vaal is dead.  That's not unusual, Doctor.  Captain, I'm not at all certain we did the correct thing on  Gamma Trianguli Six.  Captain, you are aware of the biblical story of Genesis.  Precisely, Captain, and in a manner of speaking, we have given  the people of Vaal the apple, the knowledge of good and evil if you  will, as a result of which they too have been driven out of paradise.  Not at all, Captain.  I am not aware of anyone who fits that description, Captain. 
Spock here.  If we stay. 
Spock here, Captain.  How many coming, Captain? 
Our arrival was scheduled well in advance, Doctor. The annual  check of every scientific expedition is routine.  Quite impossible, Doctor. I ran a personnel check on this  expedition before we beamed down. I assure you that none of them were  (He is interrupted by the entrance of an old man and woman.  Sensors reveal nothing which is inimical to human life. The  atmosphere screens out the usual amount of harmful cosmic rays.  I have already begun investigation into that possibility,  Captain.  I've rechecked the sensors, Captain. Gamma Hydra Four checks out  as a Class M planet with a conventional oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere and  normal mass. I can find nothing at all out of the ordinary.  We're checking it on it. I've reached no conclusions as yet. The  comet was a rogue and has never been investigated.  (looking about the same as usual) Based on what Doctor McCoy  gave me, I estimate that physically we each have less than a week to  live. Also, since our mental faculties are aging faster than our  bodies, we will be little better than mental vegetables in considerably  lesser time.  Yes, Captain. In a very short time.  (sitting up) I must differ with you, Doctor. I'm having  difficulty concentrating, which is most disturbing, my eye sight  appears to be failing, and the normal temperature of the ship seems to  me to be increasingly cold.  Captain, you sent such a message this morning.  Captain, I believe (notices, and wakes him gently) Captain.  Captain.  Yes, sir. Quite understandable.  Yes, sir. We have the cause of the affliction.  The orbit of Gamma Hydra Four carried the planet directly  through the comet's trail. On conventional radiation settings, we  discovered nothing. On resetting our sensors to the extreme lower range  of the scale, undetected radiation appeared. Below normal radiation  levels but definitely present, and undoubtedly residue from the comet.  (consulting PADD) Quadrant four four eight, sir.  Mister Sulu, what is our present position?  Possibly, Doctor, because my thinking processes are not as  efficient as before.  I have a question for the doctor. (Kirk leaves) Doctor, the  ship's temperature is increasingly uncomfortable for me. I've adjusted  the environment in my quarters to one hundred twenty five degrees,  which is at least tolerable. However, I  I wondered if perhaps there was something which could lower my  sensitivity to cold.  Yes. As I always suspected. (leaves)  Commodore?  I am aware of that.  For what, sir?  On what grounds, Commodore?  Need I remind you, sir, that I too have contracted the same  affliction?  I'm half human, sir. My physical reflexes are down, my mental  capacity is reduced. I tire easily. No, sir. I am not fit for command.  Sir, I do have duties to perform.  I resist that suggestion, Commodore.  Very well, sir. The hearing shall convene at fourteen hundred  hours.  [Sickbay] (Chekov is back on the biobed.)  Let it read that this competency hearing was  ordered by Commodore Stocker and reluctantly called by myself.  On the contrary, Commodore. As presiding officer and as second  in command of the Enterprise, the responsibility is mine. Captain Kirk,  would you like to make a statement?  It is quite impossible, Captain. The regulations are quite  specific. You are entitled to direct examination of all witnesses  immediately after the board has questioned them.  Mister Sulu, how long have you served with Captain Kirk?  To your knowledge, has he ever had any difficulty making  decisions?  Did he order you to maintain standard orbit around Gamma Hydra  Four?  Did he not, several minutes later, repeat that order?  Did he order you to increase orbit?  Did he not several minutes later repeat that order?  Mister Sulu, please answer the question.  Thank you, Mister Sulu. Yeoman Atkins, you handed Captain Kirk a  fuel consumption report in the presence of witnesses, which he read and  signed. Is that correct?  Yeoman, you will simply answer the question.  You guess?  Thank you, Yeoman. You may leave. Lieutenant Uhura. I have here  a bulletin from Starfleet Command which states that the Romulans have  broken Code two. Are these your initials which appear at the bottom?  And whose initials are those which appear directly below yours?  Did Captain Kirk ask you to send a message about the comet which  passed Gamma Hydra Four?  Using Code two.  After you reminded him that the Romulans had broken Code two.  Thank you, Lieutenant. Doctor McCoy, Doctor McCoy!  Several hours ago, at the request of this board, you ran a  complete physical examination of Captain Kirk.  Medical banks, compute described subject's physical age, using  established norms as comparative base.  Doctor McCoy.  Will you give us your professional evaluation of Captain Kirk's  present physical condition.  Is not his mental capacity degenerating even more rapidly?  Doctor, you heard the computer's analysis of Captain Kirk's  physical age. Do you agree with it?  Do you agree with it, Doctor?  This board has no further questions. Unless you, Commodore  Stocker, have something that you would like to add.  Do you wish to call any witnesses, Captain Kirk?  Captain, I would suggest  Gamma Hydra Four, Captain.  You're inability to remember having given commands, reading and  signing important orders and then forgetting them, your physical  analysis as compiled by our own chief surgeon. All these things would  appear to be irrefutable proof of failing physical and mental  conditions.  We have no more questions, Captain.  There'll be no more questions, Captain. If you would leave the  room so the board can vote  Sir, you have never commanded a starship.  The danger from the Romulans  Yes, Captain.  I'm sorry, Captain.  Regulations require  Captain, I have not assumed command.  I suffer the same affliction as you, sir.  Commodore Stocker.  Mister Scott was unfit for command. Commodore Stocker is ranking  officer  I cannot, Captain.  No, sir. Only Commodore Stocker can give a command order onboard  this ship.  It would seem to be the place where I can be of the most use.  No, not all the time. Captain, he left us for a few moments.  Yes. Yes, indeed, Captain. Doctor, you remember  Quite possible, Doctor. Perhaps a sufficiently efficacious  compound could be developed.  Doctor, I made the necessary computations and produced this  serum. It is crude and dangerous, but we have no time for refinements.  It could cure or kill, Doctor.  Doctor Wallace, give him the shot.  Romulans giving ground, Captain. Obviously, they tapped in as  you expected them to.  Yes, sir.  The Romulans were caught off guard, Captain. They're falling  behind.  I am quite ready now, Doctor.  That is very considerate of you, Doctor. 
Something wrong?  Perhaps you're making a rather hasty judgment. Mister Norman has  only been aboard seventy two hours.  Specifics, Doctor. Labels do not make arguments.  I see.  I find your argument strewn with gaping defects in logic.  That's not at all surprising, Doctor. He's probably terrified of  your beads and rattles.  [Auxiliary Control] (Norman enters.)  Interesting.  Confirmed, Captain. He's taken out all the override controls. If  we tamper without knowing where the trigger relay is,  we could extinguish ourselves.  And most sophisticated.  (attempting a mind meld) He simply appears to have turned  himself off, Captain. And since we cannot repair the damage he has done  without destroying the ship  Five hundred of the same model? That seems rather redundant.  He did not pay royalties.  The guilty party has his choice. Death by electrocution, death  by gas, death by phaser, death by hanging.  You went to substantial risk and effort to bring a starship  here. Logically, you must have a compelling motive.  Then I'm unable to discern your problem.  Whom do you serve now?  We are, and we must direct our attack to the heart of the  matter. Obviously this many androids cannot operate independently.  There must be a central control system which guides the entire android  population.  Very interesting. Very interesting. This is a most unusual  device.  Did I understand there are more than two hundred thousand of  you?  This would seem to be a simple relay centre. Are all of you  controlled through this device?  Oh, that's quite understandable. [Model display area] (Two brunettes in pink are being shown to Kirk and  Uhura.)  Captain, I've just had a most fascinating  meeting with Norman, and I'm convinced I've discovered a very important  inconsistency.  (McCoy enters with Mudd)  He could successfully accomplish it, Captain. I've questioned a  number of the androids, and they're totally loyal to Mudd.  Perhaps of more concern is the fact that this android population can  literally provide anything a human being could ask for in unlimited  quantity.  Unhappiness is the state which occurs in the human when wants  and desires are not fulfilled.  Fascinating.  I'm curious, Norman. Just how do you intend to stop them?  Eminently practical.  Indeed, it is not. They may quite possibly be able to accomplish  it.  Whatever method we use to stop them, we must make haste. They  have only to install some cybernetic devices aboard the Enterprise and  they'll be able to leave orbit.  I asked them.  Yet the device that Norman claims to be their central control is  totally inadequate to the task of directing more than two hundred  thousand of them.  There are a large number of Alices and Trudies, Maisies,  Annabels, and according to my research, a Herman series, an Oscar  series, a whole plethora of series in fact. But only one Norman.  To function as they do, each android mind must be one component  of a mass brain linked through a central locus.  That would seem logical.  What would seem to be a sound, and perhaps our only,  opportunity.  I fail to understand why I should care to induce my mother to  purchase falsified patents.  Of course. Your computations would  inevitably lead to a total description of the parabolic intersection of  dimension with dimension.  Thank you.  (He attempts a neck pinch on Alice 210.)  I love you. However, I hate you.  Yes, of course. That is exactly why I hate you. Because you are  identical.  (They go out of action.)  Fascinating. [Corridor] Success, Captain. We've been pruning the leaves and branches of  the tree. Now it is time to get to work on the root.  Affirmative.  Logic is a little tweeting bird chirping in a meadow. Logic is a  wreath of pretty flowers which smell bad.  Are you sure your circuits are registering correctly? Your ears are  green.  Very well, Captain.  (He removes an invisible package from under his tunic.)  I believe that is the correct amount, Captain. Mister Mudd, are  you ready?  Be careful. I would not want you to drop it.  (Mimes an underarm throw, and Mudd juggles before 'catching' it.)  I believe they are all immobilised, Captain.  That is a human emotion, Doctor, with which I am totally  unfamiliar. How could I be unhappy?  Which I find eminently satisfactory, Doctor, for nowhere am I so  desperately needed as among a shipload of illogical humans.  The androids are being reprogrammed. Their original purpose was  to adapt this planet for productive use. They'll begin that work again.   
Deep Space Station K7 now within sensor  range, Captain.  That is illogical, Ensign. Odours cannot travel through the  vacuum of space.  Extremely little, Ensign.  Under dispute between the two parties since initial contact. The  battle of Donatu Five was fought near here twenty three solar years  ago. Inconclusive.  Undeveloped. Sherman's Planet is claimed by both sides, our  Federation and the Klingon Empire. We do have the better claim.  John Burke was the Chief Astronomer at the Royal Academy in old  Britain at the time.  Quadrotriticale is a high-yield grain, a four-lobed hybrid of  wheat and rye. A perennial, also, I believe. Its root grain, triticale,  can trace its ancestry all the way back to twentieth century Canada  Misuse of the Priority One channels is a Federation offence.  It would seem a logical precaution, Captain. The Sherman's  Planet affair is of extreme importance to the Federation.  Nevertheless Captain, the Klingons would not enjoy seeing us  successfully develop Sherman's Planet.  But not totally unexpected.  (stroking a tribble) A most curious creature, Captain. Its  trilling seems to have a tranquillising effect on the human nervous  system. Fortunately, of course, I am immune to its effect.  (Everyone stares, he suddenly realises what he is doing, and puts it  down. Spock and Kirk leave.)  Captain, may I ask where you'll be?  There's something disquieting about these creatures.  Don't be insulting, Doctor. They remind me of the lilies of the  field. They toil not, neither do they spin. But they seem to eat a  great deal. I see no practical use for them.  So would an ermine violin, but I see no advantage in having one.    Doctor, I am well aware of human characteristics. I am  frequently inundated by them, but I've trained myself to put up with  practically anything.  What is that, Doctor?  Doctor?  They do have one redeeming characteristic.  They do not talk too much. If you'll excuse me, sir.  [Bridge] (Kirk walks to his chair, preoccupied by his last  conversation. When he sits, there is a squeak. He has sat on a large  tribble. Then he notices that there are fluffy balls everywhere.)  Captain, I am forced to agree with the doctor. I've been running  computations on their rate of reproduction. The figures are taking an  alarming direction. They're consuming our supplies and returning  nothing.  Surely you must have realised what would happen if you removed  the tribbles from their predator-filled environment into an environment  where their natural multiplicative proclivities would have no  restraining factors.  By removing the tribbles from their natural habitat, you have,  so to speak, removed the cork from the bottle and allowed the genie to  escape.  He simply could not believe his ears.  We have already checked on the background of Mister Cyrano  Jones. He is a licensed asteroid locator and prospector. He's never  broken the law, at least not severely. For the past seven years, with  his one-man spaceship, he's obtained a marginal living by engaging in  the buying and selling of rare merchandise, including, unfortunately,  tribbles.  Fascinating.  Captain, there are vents of that type on the space station.  They seem to be gorged.  One million seven hundred seventy one thousand five hundred  sixty one. That's assuming one tribble, multiplying with an average  litter of ten, producing a new generation every twelve hours over a  period of three days.  And allowing for the amount of grain consumed and the volume of  the storage compartment.  Captain this tribble is dead. And so are these.  The logical assumption is that there is something in the grain.  I believe that more than the word of an aggrieved Klingon  commander would be necessary for that, Mister Baris.  Remarkable.  Obviously tribbles are very perceptive creatures, Captain.  The penalty is twenty years in a rehabilitation colony.  Seventeen point nine, to be exact.  He'll do it.  Captain, Starfleet was able to divert that  freighter.  Based on computer analysis, of course, taking into account the  possibilities of  Well, it was Mister Scott who performed the actual engineering. 
No doubt about it, Captain. The space debris comes from the  survey vessel SS Beagle.  Portions of the antimatter nacelles, personal belongings.  Captain, no signs of bodies whatsoever.  It would have come from planet four, star system eight nine two,  directly ahead.  SS Beagle. Small class four stardrive vessel. Crew of forty  seven, commanded by. Jim, I believe you knew him. Captain R M Merik.  Different in shape only, Captain. The proportion of land to  water is exactly as on your Earth. Density five point five, diameter  seven nine one seven at the equator, atmosphere seventy eight percent  nitrogen, twenty one percent oxygen. Again, exactly like Earth.  I also picked up indications of large cities.  No sign of atomic power as yet, but far enough along for radio  communications, power transportation, an excellent road system.  Television was the colloquial term.  Captain, the one described as the barbarian is also listed here.  Flight officer William B. Harrison of the SS Beagle. At least there  were some survivors down there.  But hardly more practical, captain. Close to the city we  located, but not populated. We should not be observed.  (They head down the steep slope. Spock takes some tricorder scans.)  Fascinating. This atmosphere is remarkably similar to your  twentieth century. Moderately industrialised pollution containing  substantial amounts of carbon monoxide and partially consumed  hydrocarbons.  Yes, I believe that was the term. I had no idea you were that  much of a historian, Doctor.  Then the Prime Directive is in full force, Captain?  I fail to see the humour in that situation, Doctor.  Complete Earth parallel. The language here is English.  (Kirk tries to go for his phaser, and another shot hits the ground near  his feet.)  There would seem to be evidence to that effect.  (Four men appear from behind rocks. They are wearing t-shirts with a  short chain motif at the neck. The leader is barefoot and wearing  shorts.)  I call them ears.  Never. Colloquial twentieth-century English. An amazing  parallel.  Sir, we came here looking for some friends, forty seven of them  who were stranded here some six years ago. They wore clothing similar  to ours. Have you heard of such men?  (brings over a magazine) Captain, I thought you might find this  interesting.  Fascinating.  Captain, a logical question, if I may. Septimus, how many years  ago did Merikus become your first citizen?  Curious, Captain, the similarity in names. Were you told why  Merik was dropped from the Space Academy?  Why, Doctor?  Even more fascinating. Slavery evolving into an institution with  guaranteed medical payments, old-age pensions.  Doctor, if I were able to show emotion, your new infatuation  with that term would begin to annoy me.  Really, Doctor, I had no idea they were trained. Watching you, I  assumed it was trial and error.  Interesting, and given a conservative empire, quite  understandable.  I said I understood it, Doctor. I find the checks and balances  of this civilisation quite illuminating.  They do seem to have escaped the carnage of your first three  world wars, Doctor.  Situations quite familiar to the six million who died in your  first world war, the eleven million who died in your second, the thirty  seven million who died in your third. Shall I go on?  Quite correct.  I tell you I'm well able to defeat you.  I do not want to injure you.  (The cat-calls and hisses are amplified. Flavius gets a taste of the  whip.)  Need any help, Doctor?  Such emotions are foreign to me, Doctor. I'm merely testing the  strength of the door.  Doctor, I am seeking a means of escape. Will you please be  brief?  Yes, that's quite true.  Oh, yes. You humans have that emotional need to express  gratitude. You're welcome, I believe, is the correct response. However,  Doctor, you must remember I am entirely motivated by logic. The loss of  our ship's surgeon, whatever I think of his skill, would mean a  reduction in the efficiency of the Enterprise and therefore  Really, Doctor?  What did they do to you?  I wish we could have examined that belief of his more closely.  It seems illogical for a sun worshiper to develop a philosophy of total  brotherhood. Sun worship is usually a primitive superstition religion.  It will replace their imperial Rome, but it will happen in their  twentieth century. 
Captain? Captain? Captain?  Captain's log, stardate 3843.4. First Officer Spock  in temporary command. The captain has been critically wounded by one of  the delegates to the Babel conference. The ship is on alert status. We  are still being followed by the intruder vessel.  [Sickbay]
Large prints. The ape-like carnivore in the reports?  Aside from that, you say it's a Garden of Eden?  Class M in all respects. Quite Earth-like.  Bows and arrows, Captain?  Captain, look.  (A group of blond hunters is approaching. They do have bows and  arrows.)  Captain, use of our phasers is expressly forbidden.  (So instead Kirk throws a rock which startles a villager into firing  his weapon early.)  No, Captain. I can travel.  (They join McCoy.)  Nurse.  Hit me. The pain will help me to consciousness. Hit me.  Blast you, strike me! If I don't regain consciousness soon, it  may be too late. Hit me. (she slaps his face) Harder!  (She does, with tears in her eyes.)  Again. Continue. The pain will help me to consciousness.  That will be quite enough. Thank you, doctor.  She was doing as I requested, Mister Scott. A Vulcan form of  self-healing.  Thank you, nurse. I'm quite fully recovered.  Position, Mister Scott?  The Klingons?  Stand by to signal the captain.  An illogical question, Doctor, since  obviously you are hearing my voice. [Hillside]
Acknowledged, Captain.  Spock here. [Transporter room] I presume you mean they vanished in a manner  not consistent with the usual workings of the transporter, Mister  Scott. [Transporter room] Have you reversed controls? [Transporter room] Power surge? [Transporter room] Recheck your equipment, Mister Scott. I'll  scan for them on the planet's surface. Spock out. [Combat area] I'm beginning to believe that, Mister Scott. I've conducted two  sweeps of the planet's surface. There is no sign of life.  No, Doctor. Even that would show up on our sensors.  The only answers are negative. No magnetic storms, no ionic  interference, no breakdown in your equipment.  We shall continue sensor scans, Doctor. At the moment, that is  all we can do, except hope for a rational explanation.  True, Doctor. Constant exposure does result in a certain degree  of contamination.  [Accommodation block] (A curved corridor, with doors off on either side.  The doors have iron bars in the upper half.)  They are not within the confines of this  solar system.  I have never heard of a study being done, but it would be a  fascinating project.  Precisely.  No. I would say approximately four hundred  I would welcome a suggestion, Doctor, even an emotional one, as  to where to look.  Captain's log, stardate 3259.2. First  Officer Spock in command. The Captain, Lieutenant Uhura, and Ensign  Chekov have been missing for nearly two hours. Computer probability  projections are useless due to insufficient data.  Interesting. It seems to be an ionisation trail.  Exactly the question I have just fed to the computers, Doctor.  And the answer is, nothing known to us would account for it.  Plot a follow course, Ensign Haines.  Doctor, I am chasing the Captain, Lieutenant Uhura, and Ensign  Chekov, not some wild aquatic fowl. This is the only lead we've had.  Initiate. Warp factor two. [Chekov's cell] (The robust woman in pink brings him his tray. She  smiles at him.)  Projecting back along the path of ionisation, the nearest system  is M two four alpha.  Eleven point six three zero.  I'm suggesting nothing, Doctor. I am merely pursuing the only  logical course available to us.  [Training area] (The three are learning how to fight with the long  poles with the curved hook on one end and grapple on the other. Galt  enters with another thrall, his hands tied behind him.)  We searched the area.  Such as a failure in the transporter mechanism?  There was no sign of them in the area of Gamma Two.  In that case, Doctor, we have nothing to lose by pursuing our  present course.  [Ruins] (Shahna has taken Kirk for a run.)  Mister Scott, can we manage anything faster  than warp six?  Doctor, I do not respond to hunches. No transporter malfunction  was responsible for the disappearance. They were not within the Gamma  system. A focused beam of extremely high-intensity light was directed  into the Gamma system from the trinary system we are now approaching.  No known natural phenomena could have caused that beam. Does that  clarify the situation?  I see. (pause) Gentlemen, I am in command of this vessel, and we  shall continue on our present course. (conspiratorial whisper) Unless  it is your intention to declare a mutiny.  Agreed. Mister Scott, could you manage warp seven?  Ensign, warp seven. [Kirk's cell] (Shahna brings a nourishment tray.)  Sensors indicate only one concentration of life forms on the  planet, on the lower hemisphere. Humanoid readings.  There will be no landing force, Doctor. Assuming the captain and  the others are still alive, it would be unwise to endanger them by  beaming down a large contingent.  Interesting. No power source. It may be shielded.  I shall beam down, Doctor. If I am unable to communicate, a  landing party may be necessary.  Daniel, as I recall, had only his faith. But I welcome your  company, Doctor. Mister Scott, you'll be in command.  Fascinating. 
Spock here, Captain.  Acknowledged.  Spock here. 
Bridge to Captain Kirk.  Shuttlecraft to Enterprise.  Diverting all secondary power to the shields. (McCoy  enters) I'll continue communications as long as there is power to  transmit.  I heard, Captain. [Shuttlecraft] In six seconds.  (Spock is thrown around in the shuttlecraft, everyone on the ship just  feels a jolt.)  I am undamaged, Captain. Relay to Mister Scott I had three  percent power reserve before the shields stabilised. [Shuttlecraft] However, I am able to identify the  chromosome structure. [Shuttlecraft] I'm having difficulty maintaining ship control.  I'm losing voice contact I will transmit internal  co-ordinates of chromosome bodies.  This is Spock. [Shuttlecraft] (Barely audible over static) The  nervous energy of the organism is maximal just within its outer  protective membrane. Relatively insensitive to interior irritation. I  believe sufficient charge of (inaudible) could destroy the organism.  Tell Doctor McCoy he should have wished me luck.  Captain's log stardate 4309.4. We have determined  we can destroy the creature, provided we can do it from inside the  organism.  Spock clearly knew how to destroy it but was unable to transmit that  information.  [Kirk's quarters] Captain, I recommend you abandon the attempt. [Shuttlecraft]
We shall arrive in your office within  ten minutes. Spock out. [Bridge]
Mister Spock.  Captain Kirk.  Spock here. Would you come to the transporter room. We  think we may have found an answer. 
No life form readings, Captain. Continuing scan.  I am getting readings on small metallic objects, Captain. It is  possible the ship was destroyed in space and the survivors proceeded  here in a shuttle craft.  Confirmed.  (A male in an orange suit and a female in a blue outfit approach the  party.)  Interesting. A neural field?  What brings you here?  Why use our vessel? Why not transmit a message to your galaxy?  Fascinating material. Similar to diburnium, but considerably  more dense. I doubt even phaser fire could disturb its molecular  structure.  No, Doctor. More than that. They registered as perfect human  life forms. I recall noting the readings were almost classic textbook  responses. Most curious.  The chances are very much against it.  Gentlemen, I'm constrained to point out we do not even know what  this projector looks like.  Possible. I would have to have one to examine.  Yes, I recall, Captain. I led him to believe we had escaped.  I shall attempt it.  (Kelinda seems to be getting nervous as Spock makes his attempt, then  he is suddenly thrown across the cell. They go to his aid, Kelinda  enters and Kirk grabs her and knocks her out. He takes the belt  device.)  Yes, I will be all right, Captain. We must hurry. [Planet surface] (But as they come running out of their cell, Rojan  and Hanar immobilise them. Kelinda walks over and is given her device  back.)  Yes, quite all right, Doctor.  I did not break it, Doctor. I was thrown away by something I've  never experienced before.  A series of bizarre and exotic images bursting on my mind and  consciousness. Colours, shapes, mathematical equations fused and  blurred. I've been attempting to isolate them, but so far I've been  able to recall clearly only one. Immense beings, a hundred limbs which  resemble tentacles. Minds of such control and capacity that each limb  is capable of performing a different function.  Undoubtedly.  I'm dubious of the possibilities of success, Captain. The  medical equipment is not designed to put out a great deal of power. The  polarized elements would burn out quickly.  A small one.  I assure you, Captain, I am in perfect health.  We find it more restful to the body than your so-called  vacation.  It will take me a moment to prepare.  I've located their power source, captain. It's installed in  Engineering.  Whatever it is we must do, it is impossible.  This material surrounding the projector is the same as I  discovered on the planet. Readings indicate it is impervious to any of  our weapons. We cannot penetrate the casing to get to the machine.  There is one other possibility, Mister Scott. The final  decision, of course, must be the captain's, but  I believe we must have it ready for him. The Enterprise is propelled by  matter-anti-matter reactors. The barrier we must traverse is negative  energy.  Nor I. But it must be made available to the captain. [Corridor] (Spock and Scott meet up with Kirk.)  Impossible, Captain. The power source is protected by a material  we cannot breach even with our phasers. Mister Scott and I have  prepared the means for the only logical alternative available to us.  The barrier we must penetrate is composed of negative energy.  When we engage the barrier, the ship will explode. The Kelvans  will be stopped here.  Sensors indicate density negative, radiation negative, energy  negative. (Kirk starts chewing his nails with indecision) All  instruments off the dials, Captain. We are in contact with the  barrier.  Instruments returning to normal, Captain.  Life support systems sustaining on emergency.  I have reviewed ship's personnel, Captain. It appears we four  are the only ones the Kelvans consider essential.  Captain?  (They look over at Tomar, who is enjoying his meal.)  Most curious.  The isolated glimpses of things I saw when I touched Kelinda's  mind are beginning to coalesce in my consciousness. The Kelvans have  superior intellectual capacity. To achieve it, they have apparently  sacrificed anything which would tend to distract them. Perceptive  senses such as taste, touch, smell, and, of course, emotions.  Yes. Quite correct, Captain. But they have taken human form and  are therefore having human reaction.  That seems reasonable.  Yes. Humans are very peculiar. I often find them unfathomable,  but an interesting psychological study.  I believe you're referring to a kiss. But it is my understanding  that such apologies are usually exchanged between people who have some  affection for each other.  Your game is off. Are you disturbed by the incident?  You've known Kelinda for some time. She's a Kelvan as you are.  Among humans, I've found the symptoms you're displaying usually  indicate jealousy.  Captain Kirk seems to find her quite attractive.  You are not jealous?  Nor upset?  Checkmate. [Scott's quarters] Rojan has exhibited symptoms of jealousy.  (Kelinda enters.)  Doctor, I'm due for another injection of stokaline.  Stokaline.  Automatic sensors and various other recording devices require  monitoring and periodic adjustments.  If you wish, I shall call him to the bridge.  I left him in the recreation room.  No, Kelinda was with him. She seemed anxious to speak to him.  It would appear, sir, that you have little control over her. Or  perhaps Captain Kirk has more.  (Rojan leaves the bridge.)  [Scott's quarters] (The last drops of Scotch go into Tomar's glass.)  Rojan, you are only a link in a chain, following an order given  three hundred years ago. This is an opportunity for you to establish a  destiny of your own.  A robot ship could be sent to Kelva with the Federation  proposal. 
Someone or something is attempting to attract our attention.  I do not know. Not even a Vulcan can know the unknown, Captain.  We are hundreds of light years past where any Earth ship has ever  explored.  Class M planet, Captain.  With two very important exceptions. It's much older than Earth,  and about a half million years ago, its atmosphere was totally ripped  away by some sort of cataclysm. The planet has evidently been dead  since then. Sensors detect no life of any kind.  Captain.  Sensors registering some form of energy deep inside the planet.  Reading energy only, Captain. No life forms.  Coming from deep under the planet's surface, Captain. Under at  least one hundred miles of solid rock.  Reading a chamber now. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, suitable for  human life support.  Captain, I do wish to inspect whatever this is that lived that  long ago.  Fascinating.  Evidently, Captain.  Unlikely. These co-ordinates correspond with the location of the  subterranean chamber.  I'm sure she did, Captain, Just as you received an order to  bring me along.  Approximately one hundred twelve point three seven miles,  Doctor.  Captain, the security guards.  This vault was constructed about a half a million years ago.  About the same time the planet surface was destroyed, if our sensor  readings are accurate.  They're an alloy or substance completely unknown to me. Much  stronger and harder than anything I've measured before.  Sargon, would it harm you if I  Pure energy. Matter without form.  That would tend, however, to explain certain elements of Vulcan  prehistory.  Just a moment, Doctor.  And if he refuses, Doctor, what do you propose to do with your  phaser? That is still Jim's body.  (Kirk convulses briefly, and the sphere has dimmed a lot.)  What are your plans for it? Can you exchange places again when  you wish?  Doctor?  What is it you want of us?  When the struggle came which devastated your planet  Fascinating.  These others, they were stored differently than you, but it was  Our bodies, Sargon, for what purpose?  Then you intend to construct mechanical bodies, move your minds  into them, and then return our bodies to us.  Captain, do you know what happened? Do you remember any part of  it?  Once inside their mechanical bodies, engineer, they can leave  this planet, travel back with us. With their knowledge, mankind could  leap ahead ten thousand years.  No, he's not.  (with a grin and echoy voice) Hello. Oh, you are a lovely  female. A pleasant sight to wake up to after half a million years.  You're welcome.  This is an excellent body, Doctor. I seem to have received the  best of the three. Strength, hearing, eyesight, all far above your  human norms. I'm surprised the Vulcans never conquered your race.  Yes, of course, Just as we do, Doctor.  (Mulhall/Thalassa collapses and they help her back onto the bed.)  It will be unnecessary, Doctor. This Vulcan body is accustomed  to the higher metabolism.  I'll prepare the formula, Sargon.  I can continue in this body for several hours.  This woman will assist me. (to Chapel) You will take me to your  pharmacology laboratory.  (They leave.)  Now. this formula will reduce the heart  action and the bodily functions to normal. While the bodies are  occupied, you will administer one injection of ten cc's each hour.  This hypo you will code mark for Thalassa. And this one you will  code mark for me.  This one you will administer to Captain Kirk while Sargon is in  his body.  No, that's correct. But since I will arrange for you to  administer each of the injections, no one else will notice.  What were you saying?  Yes. Well, you were about to say that you watched me prepare the  formula and fill each of the hypos.  Very good. You see, Sargon would not permit me to keep this  body. It is therefore necessary for you to kill your captain  so that Sargon will die with him.  Enterprise Medical Log. Stardate 4769.1. Three  alien minds now inhabit the bodies of Captain Kirk, Science Officer  Spock, and Doctor Ann Mulhall. [Sickbay] In two days, you'll have your own hands, Thalassa. Mechanically  efficient and quite human-looking. Android robot hands, of course.  Hands without feeling. Enjoy the taste of life while you can.  It will have twice the strength and agility of your body,  engineer, and will last a thousand years. That is, assuming you'll stop  wasting your time and allow us to complete it.  (Scott leaves as 'Spock' laughs.)  A thousand-year prison, Thalassa. And when it wears out we'll  build another one, and we'll lock ourselves into it for another  thousand years. And another, and another. Sargon has closed his mind to  a better way. With these bodies.  When you awoke in this body, Thalassa, you said how good it was  to breathe again, to have eyes and to see again. To feel. To live and  feel again, Thalassa. Just think how much we can do for mankind. Are  these bodies too much to ask for in return? Would you prefer this?  This is your new home, Thalassa. Once occupied, I'll add female  features and some texturing. You no doubt want the mechanism to at  least appear to be a woman. (he tests its hand movement.) It is ready,  Thalassa.  You have no excuse to keep the real body any longer. Sargon  would've required that you enter the mechanism immediately.  Must I make an example of you, too, Helm?  (Kirk, Mulhall and McCoy enter.)  Pain, Captain. And you, my dear?  (As Kirk and Mulhall double over, McCoy dashes to Spock's side, ready  to inject him.)  Fortunately, Doctor, I know every thought of every mind around  me. See? (to Chapel) Take the hypo from him. And inject him with it.  (But she injects Spock/Henoch instead! He leaps from his seat.)  Fools. I'll simply transfer to another place, another body.  (He whirls around.)  Sargon! No, Sargon, please. Let me. Let me transfer.  (He falls to the floor and his victims are freed from their  pain.)  It seems, Doctor, the injection was only enough to cause  unconsciousness.  The place Henoch would least suspect, Captain. 
Passing outer planet, Zeon.  I never met John Gill, but I studied Earth history from the text  he prepared.  What impressed me most was his treatment of Earth history as  causes and motivations rather than dates and events.  Yes, but it must be a Zeon ship. Zeons do have a crude  interplanetary capability. Reaction powered. A small rocket. It is on  an intercept course. That would mean it has sophisticated detection  devices which neither Zeon nor Ekos should have.  Captain, it's an unmanned probe which seems to be carrying a  warhead.  Fascinating. A thermonuclear warhead.  Most interesting. We were attacked by a thermonuclear missile  from a planet which should have no such weapon.  According to our records, the Ekosians are a primitive, warlike  people in a state of anarchy. The other planet, Zeon, has a relatively  high technology, and its people are peaceful.  Ready, Captain.  The Ekosians are humanoid, so there is apt to be a similarity in  architecture. Interesting.  (A man runs round the corner and trips.)  Captain, the non-interference Directive.  Mid-twentieth century Earth. The nation state called Nazi  Germany.  (A broadcast comes over a screen hung between two columns of a building  in the street.)  Virtually impossible, Captain, yet the evidence is quite clear.  Fascinating.  You propose we pass ourselves off as Nazis, Captain?  That's very well taken, Captain. [Another street] (With Spock in a grey uniform with the obligatory  tin helmet.)  Yes. Obviously he's not one of us. I captured him. Is that not  correct procedure with enemies of the Fatherland?  Take charge of him.  Your uniform, Captain.  Quite correct. You should make a very convincing Nazi. [Outside the Chancellery] Yes. I shall tend to it, Major.  Obviously.  Why do the Nazis hate Zeons?  Is Zeon a threat to them?  It would seem the assumption was premature.  That would coincide with the time of John Gill's arrival.  Captain, the flaw in the plan is this locked door, and the guard  beyond it. To the logical mind, the outlook is somewhat gloomy.  Yes.  Of course. The rubindium crystals in the transponders.  (Kirk pulls a metal strip from the bed in the cell, and Spock uses it  to cut into Kirk's arm.)  Yes. We must hold the crystals rigidly at a specific distance,  which I believe should be twenty seven point two millimetres.  (He bends the metal strip accordingly.)  Twenty seven point two millimetres would be, approximately,  there. That is, of course, a crude estimation.  Yes. To reach that light, I shall require some sort of platform.    Now, the rubindium crystals should find enough power here to  achieve the necessary stimulus. As I recall from the history of  physics, the ancient lasers were able to achieve the necessary  excitation, even using crude natural crystals.  (Kirk squats down and Spock eventually stands on his thighs, leaning  against the well-injured back.)  Yes, of course, Captain. You realise that the aim will of course  be very crude.  Captain, why should I aim at such a structure?  May I remind you, we did not intend to fight.  Possibly.  I do not see them.  Captain, without phasers, and until we are able to communicate  with the ship, it is illogical to assume that we can hold out against  the entire military force of this planet.  Captain, I suggest the most profitable use of our time would be  to reassemble our communicators. May I work undisturbed somewhere?  By using parts from both, I've completed one communicator. I do  not know if the circuits are correct, Captain. There is no way to test  it, except in actual use.  The one receiving a medal.  This young lady is a Nazi, a hero of the Fatherland. We saw her  being decorated.  That is correct.  As an honoured member of the Party, she could get us past the  guards.  Captain, I'm beginning to understand why you  Earthmen enjoy gambling. No matter how carefully one computes the odds  of success, there is still a certain exhilaration in the risk.  Captain, it was John Gill, but he never moved. Never once looked  up.  Or a deep psychosis.  It may not have the range it had. In fact, it may not work at  all.  Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise. Come in, Enterprise.  If there's going to be a delay in transporting the doctor, I  suggest we cancel our  There is a logical way to proceed, Doctor. Point your toe, apply  equal pressure to either side of the boot, and push. We have no time  for emotionalism.  Yes. A doctor should have more pride.  Captain, I do not understand how he failed to recognise us.  True. I shall reconsider.  (A buzzer sounds.)  Captain, the speech follows no logical pattern.  What drug?  Captain. I have created a condition in which Gill cannot  initiate speech or any other action, but he can reply to questions.  Quite correct. For the last few years, the real power has been  Melakon.  Quite true, Captain. That tiny country, beaten, bankrupt,  defeated, rose in a few years to stand only one step away from global  domination.  Perhaps Gill felt that such a state, run benignly, could  accomplish its efficiency without sadism.  Is he dead, Captain?  Indeed, Captain. With the union of two cultures, this system  would make a fine addition to the Federation.  Captain, I never will understand humans. How  could a man as brilliant, a mind as logical as John Gill's, have made  such a fatal error?  Thank you, Doctor. I was able to gather the meaning.  Yes. Earthmen like Ramses, Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler,  Lee Kuan. Your whole Earth history is made up of men seeking absolute  power.  Obviously, Doctor, you fail to accept 
Another contact, Captain. A large, slow-moving vessel. [Bridge] Spock to Captain Kirk.  We are ready, Captain.  Examine the H two seven nine elements,  also the G nine five systems.  Spock to Captain. 
Spock here, Captain. [Corridor]
Transporter room to Captain. [Transporter room] It's incredibly powerful. 
On mark eight and closing.  Fascinating.  A mechanical device of unknown properties. I read no life forms  aboard.  Obviously, it intends to intercept us. It has made several  course changes corresponding with our own.  Unclear whether it intends to attack or merely communicate with  us.  Indeed.  Vulcan, Captain.  Unquestionably. Most impressive.  True telepaths can be most formidable, and we have been warned.  No recorded contacts. If they ever ventured into space, they  evidently withdrew immediately.  I prefer being a welcomed guest, Captain, but there seems to be  little choice.  Unknown, Captain. Sensor readings give no indication of fog like  conditions in this area.  Unknown, Captain. Unlike Mister Scott's transporter, this unit  is not functioning.  No use, Captain. Obviously none of our devices will function.  Apparently that Melkotian buoy  Fascinating.  Obviously this represents the Melkotian's concept of an American  frontier town, circa 1880.  Perhaps the Melkotians have insufficient data about this era.  Crude but dangerous.  Captain, the Melkot said you were the pattern. He looked into  your mind and selected what he considered the proper time and place for  our punishment.  Yes. The violence of your own heritage is to be the pattern for  our execution.  Precisely, in terms of what the Melkots intend for us.  Are they really?  Captain, I pride myself on my knowledge of your Earth history.  The names were known in the annals of the opening of the western sector  of America. the United States of America, that is.  And the Clanton gang. On October 26th, they had it out.  History cannot be changed.  (There's a brawl in the saloon and a window is broken. A man in black  wearing a badge shoots another man. The group run over.)  Is this a dead man, Doctor?  Captain, since we have seen that death is the one reality in  this situation, I seriously suggest you reseat yourself immediately.  Without moving a muscle of either hand. If I remember correctly, that  would involve you in what was called the fast draw. It initiated  unfortunate events.  (Everyone sits. Slowly.)  I believe he was actually trying to provoke a dispute with  Mister Chekov.  I assure you, sir, we shall watch it, and everything, extremely  closely.  The day is still young, Ensign.  And if this is indeed some sort of replay of history, the Earps  will kill the Clantons at the OK Corral at five o'clock this afternoon.    Impossible, Captain. In this century, there are no metal alloys  or power sources to make devices such as ours.  Mister Chekov is involved, Captain.  It is obvious the Melkotians are not going to permit us to leave  this town.  There's no way we can know where it is, Doctor.  I could make a device to deliver it on target.  I shall need some fusing and cotton wadding.  I shall manufacture the equivalent of an ancient generating  canister, more familiarly known as a gas grenade. [Barber/Dentist's office] (The sign on the wall says Teeth Pulling By  Appointment. There's a man in the chair having a shave.)  And it is not yet our time. [Saloon] (Spock is working on the grenade, McCoy and Scott  on the tranquilliser.)  Gentlemen, there is one thing which requires the immediate  attention of all of us. Specifically, our future.  I understand the feeling, Captain.  My feelings are not a subject for discussion, Doctor.  Captain, it's quite all right. They forget I am half human.  (The clock strikes four.)  Captain. I vaguely remember the historical account of the famous  battle in which we are about to engage, but I am confused.  Since each of us represents members of the Clanton gang. You,  Ike Clanton, I, Frank McLowery, then Mister Chekov would be the other  Billy, would he not?  But did not William Claiborne survive the battle at the OK  Corral?  Mister Chekov is dead. But in the actual gunfight, William  Claiborne survived.  Another hour.  Not precisely.  It should.  Negotiating with them could buy us more time, Captain.  It would be worth a try, at least until we're certain of the  device. Then perhaps we could quiet things down.  These crude supplies we were forced to use  worked quite well.  Perhaps they would've been if they'd had your ingenuity, Doctor.    (Kirk enters.)  Captain?  Right now.  It has not been tested.  But this is painless.  Fascinating.  Captain, you don't seem to understand. It did not function, but  it must function.  A scientific fact But if the tranquilliser does not function,  which is clearly impossible, then a radical alteration of our thought  patterns must be in order.  That may not be necessary.  A fact, Captain. Physical laws simply cannot be ignored.  Existence cannot be without them.  I mean, Doctor, that we are faced with a staggering  contradiction. The tranquilliser you created should have been  effective.  Exactly. Doctor, in your opinion, what killed Mister Chekov?  Wrong. His mind killed him.  Physical reality is consistent with universal laws. Where the  laws do not operate, there is no reality. All of this is unreal.  But you made your examination under conditions which we cannot  trust. We judge reality by the response of our senses.  Once we are convinced of the reality of a given situation, we abide by  its rules. We judged the bullets to be solid, the guns to be real,  therefore they can kill.  He may indeed be dead. We do not know.  Exactly. I know the bullets are unreal, therefore they cannot  harm me.  Precisely.  The smallest doubt would be enough to kill you.  Very well, sir. Engineer?  (The clock strikes five. Wyatt Earp puts on his gun belt.)  Your mind to my mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts.  (The marshalls gather as the lightning flashes and the wind blows.)  (to McCoy) The bullets are unreal. Without body. They are  illusions only. Shadows without substance. They will not pass through  your body, for they do not exist.  Captain.  Captain, the Melkotian object.  The object is beginning to emit M-rays of a highly unstable  nature, Captain.  Energy output increasing beyond measurable levels, Captain.  Captain. May I ask a question? You needn't answer if it seems  too personal.  This afternoon, you wanted to kill, didn't you?  But he wanted to, Doctor.  Yes, Captain.  Mankind, ready to kill.  I wonder how humanity managed to survive. 
Bridge to Captain.  That sensor ghost is moving closer.  Spock here, Captain. I am triangulating now. It's coming  from the engineering section.  Spock here, Captain.  Captain?  Captain.  (The door opens, and McCoy and Spock see the lovers in their close  embrace.) 
Deflection point.  Full power, Mister Scott. 
Are you prepared to beam over?  On humans. 
Borgia plant listed in library record tapes as  carbon group three vegetation similar to Earth nightshade family.  Alkaloid poison. Chemical structure common to class M planets. About  the strange mottling on his facial skin surface. There is no reference  to this symptom. 
Humans do have an amazing capacity for believing what they  choose and excluding that which is painful.  The attack on Professor Starnes' party must surely have been  unprovoked.  I stand corrected, Captain. Induced would be a more precise  term. Induced by an outside force.  The release of bacteria. Or a helpless mental depression and a  state of suicidal anxiety could have been chemically induced.  I do not know, but it is possible.  A valid assumption, I would say.  Or the promise of reward.  At present, yes. (his tricorder beeps) Odd.  There seems to be some disturbance coming from that cave. [Cave] Definitely not humanoid, Captain. Impossible to make any  specific identification. The readings do not correlate with any known  information.  I'm not aware of it, Captain.  I am not familiar with anxiety, but I wasn't aware it could be  registered on sensors.  Are you all right, Captain?  (enters) Captain, I have extracted the salient portion of  Professor Starnes' tapes.  Among the technical facts he gathered, Professor Starnes also  offered some rather unscientific hypotheses.  There is another portion, Captain, which I believe you'll find  particularly interesting.  Unknown.  He never completed the entry, and the dispatch was never sent.  Except for scenes of family life, games and picnics with the children,  that is the complete record. Whatever overwhelmed them must have done  so with incredible speed. Otherwise, the professor would have provided  details of the experience. He was an excellent scientist and tireless  in his pursuit of the truth.  Possible, Captain. Evil does seek to maintain power by  suppressing the truth.  According to the legend, Triacus was the seat of a band of  marauders who made constant war throughout the system of Epsilon Indi.  After many centuries, the destroyers were themselves destroyed by those  they had preyed upon.  No, like so many legends, this one too has a frightening ending.  It warns that the evil is awaiting a catalyst to set it again into  motion and send it marauding across the galaxy.  I was speaking of a legend, Captain.  According to Federation records, this is the first.  He said an unseen force was influencing him, that he recognised  it, was beginning to fight it and cancelled his request for a ship.  I am unable to lock on to the proper co-ordinates.  It appears we are no longer orbiting Triacus.  Captain, we are no longer orbiting Triacus.  Captain, why are we bothering Starfleet?  This bridge is under complete control.  There is no need.  I cannot obey your order, Captain.  (A vain communications officer who cannot ignore a reflection, a  helmsman who thinks he is flying the ship through a tunnel of swords...  Kirk goes to the security guard.)  Captain, we must get off this bridge.  Captain.  Jim.  Correct, Captain. [Corridor] Where to, Captain?  Captain, so long as the children are present, there is danger.  They are the carriers.  They are followers. Without followers, evil cannot spread.  Captain, the four hundred and thirty men and women on board the  Enterprise and the ship itself are endangered by these children.  Perhaps that is true, but the evil that is within them is  spreading fast, and unless we can find a way to remove it  You take from those who do not know you.  Why should you fear it?  Tommy's father would have destroyed you, but he recognised you  too late. 
Configuration unidentified. Ion propulsion, high velocity,  though of a unique technology.  One. Humanoid or similar. Low level of activity. Life-support  systems functioning.

(hoarse) Yes. Doctor McCoy.  If you will finish reconnecting my speech centre, I might be  able to help.  Yes. That's correct. One thing at a time. Ah, ah, mmm. (normal  voice) That's better. Now, Doctor. Try the sonic separator.  Yes, I believe I already have some sensation of feeling. Please  stimulate the nerve endings and observe the physical reactions, one by  one. In each case, I shall tell you when the probe is correct. You will  then seal using the tri-laser connector.  Ready.  (twitching) Correct.  Correct.  Correct. Very good, Doctor.  Congratulations, Doctor. And thank you.  On the whole, Captain, I believe I am quite fit. Fascinating. A  remarkable example of a retrograde civilisation. At the peak, advanced  beyond any of our capabilities and now operating at this primitive  level which you saw. And it all began thousands of years ago when a  glacial age reoccurred. This underground complex was developed for the  women. The men remained above, and a male-female schism took place.

Thank you, Mister Marvick. I shall be wearing the visor.  It has proved effective for Vulcans.  I shall endeavour to keep it under control.  Welcome aboard, Ambassador Kollos. I am First Officer Spock.  Captain Kirk, we are ready. [Bridge] Doctor Jones, may I congratulate you on your assignment with  Ambassador Kollos.  I'm sure you will find it a fascinating experience.  No one ever has. I was referring to mind-links I had attempted  with members of other species.  I was unable to accept. My life is here. [Ambassador's quarters] (They place the box on a table.)  Spock to Bridge. We have arrived at the Ambassador's quarters. [Bridge] I would appreciate an opportunity to exchange greetings with the  Ambassador.  I almost envy you your assignment.  Not correct, Doctor, although I am aware of your mind attempting  to contact mine. Were you born a telepath?  I understand. May I show you to your quarters?  I understand. Our ship's surgeon often makes the same complaint.  Do call when you are ready.  (Spock leaves. Jones removes her visor.)  Why, thank you, Captain.  On the contrary, Doctor, I would say that Doctor Jones was  indeed fortunate.  Doctor Jones was born a telepath, Captain.  What most humans generally find impossible to understand is the  need to shut out the bedlam of other people's thoughts and emotions.  As a matter of fact, I wear it this evening to honour you,  Doctor.  I see, Doctor McCoy, you still subscribe to the outmoded notion,  promulgated by your ancient Greeks, that what is good must also be  beautiful.  I'll escort you to your quarters.  I genuinely intended to honour her, Captain. Good evening,  gentlemen.  Do you know whether he saw the Medusan?  Then insanity will surely be the result, Captain. Dangerous  insanity.  [Engineering] Trying, Captain. Mister Chekov, your assistance, please.  We are evidently far outside our own galaxy, judging from the  lack of traceable reference points. When we exceeded warp speed factor  nine point five, we apparently entered a space-time continuum.  Impossible to calculate. We lack data to analyse. Our  instruments appear to be functioning normally, but what they tell us  makes no sense. Our records are clear up to the point at which we left  our galaxy.  Unfortunately, we lack reference points on which to plot a  return course. We experienced extreme sensory distortion,  and we shall do so again if we attempt to use warp speed. And we cannot  re-cross the barrier using sub light speed.  An entertaining suggestion, Mister Chekov, but not very helpful.    KIRK; There is someone else aboard who might be able to help us  navigate. The Medusans have developed interstellar navigation to a fine  art. Could Kollos function despite the sensory distortion?  Very possibly. The Medusan sensory system is radically different  from ours. Perhaps for the purpose of this emergency I might become  Kollos.  A fusion. A mind-link to create a double entity. Each of us  would enjoy the knowledge and sensory capabilities of both. We will  function as one being.  If the link is successful there will be a tendency to lose  separate identity. A necessary risk. Of course, Doctor Jones will not  wish to give me permission to accomplish the mind-link.  Doctor Jones has shown reluctance every time I've asked to  converse with Kollos. In some ways, she is still most human, Captain,  particularly in the depth of her jealousy.  Not sufficient. Her telepathic powers are formidable. If it is  at all possible, her mind must be so engaged that no thought of what I  am doing shall intrude.  The Enterprise is at stake. It is not possible for you to be  involved.  This is not a duty that you can assume. I am aware of the fact  that your telepathic competence might be superior to mine, but there's  a more important factor. The object is to pilot this ship. That is  something you cannot do.  Fascinating.  Evidently a highly sophisticated sensor web. My compliments to  you, and to your dressmaker.  An elegant solution. but I fail to understand why you apparently  try to conceal your blindness, Doctor Jones.  This is delightful. I know you. All of you. James Kirk, Captain  and friend for many years. And Leonard McCoy, also of long  acquaintance. And Uhura, whose name means freedom.  She walks in beauty, like the  night.  Are you surprised to find that I've read Byron, Doctor?  In part. That is, part of us is known to you as Kollos. Ah,  Miranda. There you are.  O brave new world, that has such creatures  in  it.  My world is next for us. Captain Kirk, I speak for all of us you  call Medusans. I am sorry for the trouble I've brought to your ship.  And now to the business at hand. With your permission, Captain.  Co-ordination is completed.  Warp one in six seconds. Five, four, three, two, one, zero.  (The engines come to life, and the Enterprise glides back through the  barrier.)  Position report, please, Mister Chekov.  Thank you, Mister Chekov. Manoeuvre completed, Captain.  How compact your bodies are. And what a variety of senses you  have. This thing you call language though, most remarkable. You depend  on it for so very much. But is any one of you really its master? But  most of all, the aloneness.  You are so alone. You live out your lives in this shell of flesh.  Self-contained, separate. How lonely you are. How terribly lonely.  So soon?  You're a wise Captain.  (Spock goes back behind the shield and the lid opens. Then Sulu notices  the visor still on the helm console.)  I rejoice in your knowledge and in your achievement.  And the ways our differences combine to create meaning and  beauty.  (Miranda gets on the transporter pad.)  Live long and prosper, Miranda. 
Dust. Apparently these instruments have not  been recently used.  At that rate, it will take exactly seventy  four point one solar hours for the storm to pass.  Remember, Captain, what we see on this tape happened  approximately three months ago.  Negative, Captain. It doesn't register.  (Spock disappears, then McCoy.)  Exactly one two one point three two metres beneath the planet  surface, Captain.  Residual energy readings indicate we were beamed here by a  matter-energy scrambler, similar to our own transporter mechanism.  Captain, picking up a life-form reading bearing four two mark  seven.  Negative. Although humanoid, it is definitely not Homo Sapiens.  Impossible. I can make no exact identification other than it  being humanoid.  Approaching the life-form, Captain.  Still undistinguishable.  (A light reveals a young woman lying on what might be a bed, which is  itself on a stepped platform. McCoy moves towards her.)  The sand-bats of Manark Four appear to be inanimate rock  crystals, Doctor, until they attack.  (She wakes, using big gestures, and mimes her fear of Kirk's phaser.)  From what we know of the specific gravity and other  environmental factors of this planet, a life-form such as hers could  not evolve here.  (They put their phasers away.)  An unlikely possibility, Captain, since over ninety eight  percent of the known telepathic species send thoughts as well as  receive them. She's made no attempt to contact our minds.  Gem, Doctor?  Correct, Captain.  (Spock goes off, scanning with his tricorder.)  Captain, in that direction, my tricorder is now picking up a  substantial collection of objects.  Electronically sophisticated devices. I fail to understand why  my tricorder previously gave no indication of them being out there.  Fascinating.  Readings indicate the passage to the surface lies in this  direction.  (As they head off, Lal wakes up and watches them go. He is joined by  the other alien.)  [Planet surface] (A strong wind is blowing as they emerge from a  cave.)  Research station six kilometres in that direction, Captain.  Just ahead.  I believe they were never actually present, Doctor. It was a  mirage.  (Gem gestures to them to go back with her.)  Captain, it was a mirage.  Captain, I request permission to be allowed  Doctor, I'm unable to lock in on the previous readings. I can  find no exit out of here.  (A flash, Gem and a clothed but unconscious Kirk appear, along with the  forcefield to restrain McCoy and Spock.)  Her withdrawal seemed to suggest the fear of death, Doctor. Only  your urging her on caused her to continue.  Can you recall what happened, Captain?  Captain, I noted that a light preceded you at the moment you  were returned here from the Vian's laboratory.  I conclude such a light is an energy transfer point linking this  device to the power source.  (Spock refers to the hand device they took off Lal.)  If I can determine the frequency at which this device operates,  I might be able to cause it to function for us.  I would say so.  I do not know, Captain. I'm beginning to understand its  operating principles, but that is all.  Some men spend the majority of their lives in mines beneath the  surface.  I've recorded my principles and theories on the tricorder,  Doctor. Should the Vians return, there is sufficient data for you and  the captain to complete the adjustments.  Possibly not, but you and the captain together will be able to  do so.  How long will he be asleep, Doctor?  I'm not criticizing your action, Doctor. On the contrary, I'm  quite grateful for it. The captain will be spared the strain of making  so difficult a decision. You have simplified the situation  considerably.  While the captain is asleep, I am in command. When the Vians  return, I shall go with them.  Precisely. The choice would have been the captain's. Now it is  mine.  (McCoy turns away. Spock sits to carry on working. Gem puts her hand on  Spock's shoulder, and smiles. McCoy comes up behind him and gives him  an injection.)  Your action is highly unethical. My decision stands.  (Spock falls asleep next to Kirk.)  I was convinced in the same way you were, Captain. By the good  doctor's hypo.  Hmm. A most unusual device. It is a control unit, but not a  control mechanism. In fact, it is not a mechanical device.  This control is attuned to one electrical pattern of energy, the  pattern produced by the mental impulses of the person who possesses it.  It is activated solely by mental commands.  I shall attempt to do so. However, it is not possible to adjust  the control to fit more than one pattern at a time. I am, of course,  most familiar with my own pattern. Therefore, with your permission, I  Fascinating. They must have known we were capable of  comprehending this control and making use of it.  The only logical assumption is that they wish to let us go.  That is evidently their intention, Captain.  Indeed, the facts would indicate that she's essential to their  purpose.  Completed, Captain. The adjustments are delicate. They may not  survive more than even one use. However, there should be sufficient  energy to transfer us to the Enterprise.  If you so desire.  Severe heart damage. Signs of congestion in both lungs. Evidence  of massive circulatory collapse.  He's dying, Jim. We can make him comfortable, but that is all.  Internal injuries. Bleeding in the chest and abdomen.  Haemorrhage of the spleen and liver. Seventy percent kidney failure.  It could happen anytime.  I'm afraid not.  Uncertain, Captain. Dr. McCoy's analysis of her reaction assumes  that her instinct for self-preservation would prevent it. However, we  cannot be positive.  What purpose can be served by the death of our friend, except to  bring you pleasure? Surely beings as advanced as yourselves know that  your star system will soon be extinct. Your sun will nova.  Then you also know that the millions of inhabitants on its  planets are doomed.  You were correct, Captain. Everything that has occurred here has  been caused to happen by them. This has all been a great laboratory,  and we have been the subjects of the test.  Captain, Dr. McCoy's life is not solely dependent on Gem. The  Vians too must be capable of saving his life.  Captain?  The intensity of emotion is draining us and building up the  force field.  It draws its energy from us, Captain. In spite of what we see,  all emotion must be suppressed. That might weaken the field.  It is complete. Gem has earned the right of survival for her  planet. She offered her life.  What is puzzling you, Captain?  Captain, the element of chance can virtually be eliminated by a  civilisation as advanced as the Vians.  Possibly, Captain. I shall certainly give the thought all the  consideration it is due. 
Ready for interphase in twenty seconds. [Medical Lab] (Chapel turns to see the lab assistant about to  strike McCoy with a metal bar.)  And prepare to bring him aboard, Mister  Scott.  (The transporter activates, but nothing happens.)  Bring him aboard, Mister Scott.  Well, keep trying, Mister Scott. [Bridge] Negative, Doctor.  However, the ship's sensors are not  responding as predicted.  Not at this interphase. [Bridge] Spock out.  [Medical lab] (We can hear Chekov's cries as he struggles against  the restraints in Sickbay.)  Bridge. Spock here.  Why do you ask?  (Scott sees a ghostly image floating by the ladders to the upper level.  It's Kirk.)  What is it, Mister Scott? [Bridge] (McCoy enters.)  Prepare for interphase in [Bridge] The Captain's oxygen supply is running out now. Are you  standing by with a hypo of tri-ox compound for him? 
Do we have maximum magnification, Lieutenant?  Very archaic type, Captain. Sub light speed.  It would appear that the Enterprise is the target, Captain.  Yes, Captain?  Correct, Captain. We are approaching those co-ordinates.  An asteroid, two hundred miles in diameter.  Negative, Captain. We've had that area on scanners constantly.  Correct, Captain.  Typical asteroid chemically, but it is not orbiting. It is  pursing an independent course through this solar system.  It is under power, Captain. And correcting for all gravitational  stresses.  Atomic. Very archaic. Leaving a trail of debris and hard  radiation.  Asteroid has an outer shell, which is hollow. It surrounds an  independent inner core, which has a breathable atmosphere. Sensors read  no life forms.  Then the passengers, or builders, are dead.  Interesting.  The course Ensign Chekov just gave for the asteroid would put it  on a collision course with Daran Five.  Correct. Population approximately three billion and seven  hundred twenty four million, if memory serves me correctly. Estimated  time of impact three hundred ninety six days.  One fails to see the logic in making a ship look like a planet.  The asteroid ship is over ten thousand years old, Doctor. Still  no sign of life forms, Captain.  (Two tubes lift up to reveal openings and aggressive men in plaid suits  leap out and attack them. A woman watches. McCoy sees her and gets  knocked out. Kirk and Spock are overpowered. The phasers and  communicators are handed to her.)  The doctor must have received an excessively large electrical  shock.  Nothing else could've caused this, Captain. At least nothing  that has happened here.  May I ask precisely what is troubling the doctor?  Yes. I know of it, Captain.  Very well, Doctor. The Captain and I seem to have suffered no  ill effects.  Captain, informing these people they're on a ship may be in  violation of the Prime Directive of Starfleet Command.  Logical, Captain.  Also logical, Captain.  He said it was forbidden to climb the mountains.  Indeed, Doctor. The young lady did show a marked preference for  your company.  We are very interested in your world.  Incredible as it may seem, these people have  no idea they're living on a spaceship.  Captain, the Oracle room.  I believe that I can. (Kirks stops him as women walks past) The  writing is definitely Fabrini, Captain. I recognise it.  Yes. Towards the end, the Fabrini people lived underground, as  these people do, to protect themselves.  Captain. If I remember correctly, the oracle's reprehensible  conduct was initiated when Natira knelt on that platform.  Nothing here which would indicate this is anything but a planet.  There's no question but that the creators would be considered gods.  (They spot an unusual obelisk.)  Eight planets, Captain. That is the number in the Fabrina solar  system.  And no doubt they've been in flight on this asteroid ship for  ten thousand years.  (The door opens. They hide behind the obelisk as Natira enters and  kneels on the platform.)  Your decision is most illogical, Doctor.  I believe it's time to move on.  She evidently understood something. There are no guards to  detain us.  [Oracle room] Temperature one hundred eleven degrees and rising.  Temperature one hundred fifteen degrees.  One hundred twenty degrees.  Yes, it is.  It refers to the altar. Apply pressure to the centre until it  opens.  (The altar slides forward, revealing a small door to another room which  is also shimmering in the heat. A room full of 1960's IBM-style  computers. Spock gets to work flipping switches.)  I've neutralised the heating elements. [Oracle room] (It cools very quickly.)  There seems to be a weakness in one of the eight tubes.  Yes. Let me check that engine. A very simple problem, easy to  correct. [Oracle room] I believe we can attempt the course  correction, Captain.  Guidance control's taking over. I believe we can allow this ship  to go back to its automatic control.  (spotting shelves of discs) Captain. Intelligence files. Their  banks contain the total knowledge of the Fabrini, ready for the people  to consult  when they arrive at their destination. (scans them) And they seem to  have amassed a great deal of medical knowledge.  [Sickbay] (McCoy is on the biobed. Chapel gives him an  injection at Spock's signal.)  Your haemoglobin count is back to normal, Doctor, which  indicates that the flow of oxygen to each cell of your body is back up  to its abundantly energetic level. 
Spock here, Captain. [Bridge] Captain, the enemy ship is drifting, totally disabled. [Bridge] Here, Captain.  Your automatic setting is laid in,  Captain. [Bridge] You'll know in seven point nine seconds, Captain.  (They dash to the pads, then Kirk returns to the console to leave his  cutlass behind.)  [Engineering] (Kirk and Mara beam in.) 
How is the power transmitted?  Do these waves cease while you are asleep?  Thirty five.  Fascinating. I believe we're experiencing the psychokinetic  manifestations of Parmen's delirium. [Bridge] (Even the Enterprise is rocking.)  How does one obtain the power?  Captain, it will be very gratifying to leave here.  Even if he shouldn't.  Doctor McCoy, you may yet cure the common cold.  Obviously Parmen does not wish any contact made with the  Enterprise.  To shut out any knowledge of his brutal treatment of a Starfleet  captain.  Agreed, Captain. And Parmen wouldn't have treated you so  brutally if he had any intention of releasing you or the Enterprise.  (McCoy suddenly stands up stiffly and moves towards the door.)  Whose harmony? Yours? Plato wanted truth and beauty, and above  all, justice.  Two spacemen marching to a drum.  I trust they did not injure you too much, Captain.  The humiliation must have been most difficult for you to bear. I  can understand.  That may be, Doctor. However, I have noted that the healthy  release of emotion is frequently very unhealthy for those closest to  you.  So it would seem. Captain.  Do you still feel anger toward Parmen?  And you, Doctor?  Then you must release it, gentlemen, as I must master mine. I  might have seriously injured you, Captain, even killed you. They have  evoked such great hatred in me, I cannot allow it to go further. I must  master it. I must control.  (Spock breaks a goblet with one hand.)  Alexander, it is possible for you to recall how long after you  arrived here that that power began to develop?  And would you know how many months' supplies you brought with  you?  That's close enough, Alexander. Fascinating. Their power  developed two or three months after they started eating the native  foods.  Then it is logical to assume that there is a connection between  the psychokinetic power and the eating of the native foods.  Perhaps his system cannot absorb the crucial element.  The probabilities are that Alexander was born with some  biochemical deficiency relative to Platonius.  The pituitary hormones confirm the hypothesis. They also  regulate body growth.  Yes. It's also obvious why Parmen kept this little utopia  secret. Anyone coming down here and remaining long enough would acquire  the power.  The point is well taken. However, the psychokinetic power is not  additive. If it were, considering the Platonians' hostile propensities,  two or three of them would have combined forces centuries ago and  deposed Parmen.  The time factor concerns me. It may take days or even weeks  before there's enough build up from the kironide to be of any benefit  to us.  I have experienced a slight flush, Captain.  (singing) Take care, young ladies, and value your wine. Be  watchful of young men in their velvet prime.  Deeply they'll swallow from your finest kegs. Then swiftly be gone  leaving bitter dregs. Ah, bitter dregs.  With smiling words and tender touch. Man offers little and asks for so  much"  He loves in the breathless excitement of night, then leaves with your  treasure in cold morning light. Ah, in cold morning light"  We have tried.  I haven't the power. I'm deeply sorry. We've failed you.  Quite possible and logical.  (Spock throws away the poker.)  That would be highly uncharacteristic. We must expect, Parmen,  that the moment we leave here, your fear would be gone and you would  again be as sadistic and as arrogant as your twenty five hundred years  have made you. 
(bad static) Captain, I have a reading from Life Support  centre  Spock here.  Bring it to the bridge at once, Doctor. [Bridge]
Spock out.  [Planet surface] (The cairn is complete, and topped off with a  name-stone.)  Spock out.  [Bridge] Go ahead, Mister Scott.  Reverse polarity on your magnetic  probe.  That is correct, Mister Scott.  You were correct in your feel. The  Enterprise was put through a molecular transporter and reassembled  slightly out of phase. Reverse polarity should seal the incision.  What is it in you humans  That requires an overwhelming display of emotion in a  situation such as this? Two men pursue the only reasonable course of  action indicated, and yet you [Bridge]
Check out the life-support systems.  Someone strangled this woman.  TORMOLEN The other four are back there.  Dead?  Engineer at his post?  TORMOLEN He's frozen there like he didn't care.  The rest?  Be certain we expose ourselves to nothing. Spock here. Do you  read, Enterprise?  All station personnel are dead.  Unknown, Captain. It's like nothing we've dealt with before.  You received my signal, Mister Scott.  The readings are perfectly normal for me, Doctor, thank you, and  as for my anatomy being different from yours, I am delighted. Captain.  I wish I could say, Captain. The circumstances were quite  bizarre, however our record tapes may show us something.  Next tape, please.  Thank you.  He'd used the computer room as if it were an amusement gallery.  It could be some form of space madness we've never heard of, but  it would have to be caused by something. Our spectro-readings showed no  contamination, no unusual elements present.  Instruments register only those things they're designed to  register. Space still contains infinite unknowns.  We will need top efficiency, Captain. It'll be a tricky orbit.  When the planet begins to go, there may be drastic changes in gravity,  mass, magnetic field.  It's beginning. Unusually rapid shifts.  All scanning stations manned, all recorders functioning, Captain.  Obviously, this planet is condensing more rapidly than expected.  A valuable study. We may be seeing Earth's distant future. Before its  sun went dark, this planet was remarkably similar to yours.  Psychiatric file, personality quotients.  It's doubtful he meant to. He was confused, self-tortured.  His capacity for self-doubt has always been rather high. What  puzzles me is what brought it to the surface with so much force.  [Sickbay] Planet breakup is imminent, Captain. Shrinking in size at an  increasing rate. As the planet continues to shrink in size, its surface  moves away from us.  Exactly. We must be prepared to respond instantly to any sudden  change.  Rate of compaction seems constant.  Acknowledged.  Why isn't Mister Sulu at this station?  Take over here, Rand. (a male, not Janice)  You haven't answered my question. Where is Mister Sulu?  You're relieved, Mister Riley. Lieutenant Uhura, take over this  station.  Report to Sickbay, Mister Riley.  Security. Mister Riley is headed for Sickbay. See to it he  arrives. Captain Kirk to the Bridge.  [Sickbay] Lieutenant Brent, relieve Miss Uhura.  Nonviolent at this stage. Slightly disoriented. Riley seemed  rather pleased with himself, as if he were  Precisely.  Fascinating. A pattern is developing. First, Tormolen. Hidden  personality traits being forced to the surface. Then Riley, who fancies  himself a descendant of  Irish kings, and now Sulu, who is at heart a swashbuckler out of your  18th century.  Gravity pull increasing. We've shifted to two percent and should  stabilise our position.  Engine room, we need power!  Take D'Artagnon here to Sickbay.  Captain. At our present rate of descent, we have less than  twenty minutes before we enter planet atmosphere.  Status reports, all sections.  Go to Alert Baker two. Seal off main sections.  We're going to seal off, Captain, if we can minimise the spread  of whatever this is.  No way, Captain. He controls the main power panels. He can  override any channel from down there. Seventeen minutes left, sir.  (ship is jolted severely)  Sixteen minutes left, Captain. We've  stabilised, but still spiraling down.  Crewman, report to the lab!  What's going on?  Crewman, stand aside.  Message from the captain.  We have fourteen minutes left.  At the rate you're proceeding, calculations show that you'll  take a minute and a half more than we have left. You can't afford a  safety factor.  [Sickbay] Nurse? Where is Doctor McCoy?  Lab. Lab, respond please. Spock here. Lab!  What is it, Nurse?  Nurse, you should  I'm in control of my emotions.  I'm sorry.  I am sorry.  Christine.  (close to tears) I'm in control of my  emotions. Control of my emotions. I am an officer. An officer. My duty.  My duty is, is. My duty is to, to. Too late. I'm sorry. To. Two, four,  six. Six. Six times six.  [Engineering] My mother. I could never tell her I loved her.  An Earth woman, living on a planet where love, emotion, is bad  taste.  I respected my father, our customs. I was ashamed of my Earth  blood. (Kirk slaps him) Jim, when I feel friendship for you, I'm  ashamed.  t's never been done! Understand, Jim. I've spent a whole  lifetime learning to hide my feelings. (finally hits Kirk back)  It's never been done.  Jim.  Jim, there is an intermix formula.  It's never been tested. It's a theoretical relationship between  time and antimatter.  Stand by to intermix. I'll call the formulae in from the Bridge.  Fuel temperature.  Raise antimatter eight and forty degrees.  We haven't the time. We'll have to risk it. Bridge, we're ready.  [Bridge] Are you all right, Jim?  Obviously, we were successful. The engines imploded.  Engine power went off the scale as well. We're now travelling  faster than is possible for normal space.  We're back to normal time, Captain.  Yes, sir.  We've regressed in time seventy one hours. It is now three days  ago, Captain. We have three days to live over again.  This does open some intriguing prospects, Captain. Since the  formula worked, we can go back in time, to any planet, any era. 
That is exactly what it is, Mister Chekov.  Captain, there is one living creature aboard. Humanoid. He is  either injured or ill. His craft shows internal atmospheric leakage.  The creature may be suffocating.  You are certain, Doctor, that this pigmentation is the natural  condition of this individual?  Negative, Captain.  There is no theory, Captain, from the basic work of Mendel to  recent nucleotide studies, which would explain our captive. All  gradations of colour from black to brown, to yellow to white are  genetically predictable. We must therefore conclude that this alien is  that often unaccountable rarity, a mutation, one of a kind.  Yet you are pumping him full of your noxious potions as if he  were a human.  With your permission, Captain, I shall do some further research  and join you on the bridge.  )Spock leaves.)  Negative, Captain.  There is a vessel out there, Captain.  Negative. This would not be a Romulan vessel. It is totally  alien in configuration. Motive power unknown. Small size of the craft  indicates a rapid scout vessel, one or two-man crew.  Nothing identifiable. The craft appears to be built for speed  rather than combat.  None. Completely elusive. In fact, it's invisible.  There is no sensor failure. The readings persist.  It just disintegrated. Fascinating.  It is gone now, Captain, but it seems to have deposited an alien  presence.  A most unique craft. Pity it couldn't be salvaged for our study.    Elusive, Captain. I am investigating.  Confirmed, Captain. Holding pattern. Co-ordinates now indicate  we are charting course to (pause) Captain, Cheron lies between four oh  three mark seven and mark nine.  (Bele enters)  Captain, course is now clearly straight for Cheron, despite all  efforts to direct us to Ariannus.  This is Commander Spock, science officer. Destruct sequence  number two, code one, one A, two B.  Negative, Captain. We are still headed directly for Cheron.  Negative, Captain. The Enterprise is now moving in a circular  course.  Enterprise is now on course to Ariannus, Captain.  Fascinating. Two irrevocably hostile humanoids.  That description is not scientifically accurate.  Commissioner, Starfleet Command may not arrive at the solution  you anticipate. There is the matter of the shuttlecraft which Lokai  appropriated. The interrogation of that matter may be of paramount  importance to Starfleet.  We do not know that Lokai has done that.  The obvious visual evidence, Commissioner, is that he is of the  same breed as yourself.  Commissioner, perhaps the experience of my own planet Vulcan may  set an example of some value to you. Vulcan was in danger of being  destroyed by the same conditions and characteristics which threaten to  destroy Cheron. We were once a people like yourselves, wildly  emotional, often committed to irrationally opposing points of view,  leading, of course, to death and destruction. Only the discipline of  logic saved my planet from extinction.  Change is the essential process of all existence. For instance,  the people of Cheron must have once been mono-coloured.  The actual theory is that all life-forms evolved from the lower  levels to the more advanced stages.  [Bridge] Trouble, Mister Chekov?  Captain, some of the memory banks of the computer are burned  out.  I doubt that the same can be said for many of his followers.  Captain, we are within scanning range of Cheron.  Coming within visual range now, Captain.  Several large cities, uninhabited. Extensive traffic systems,  barren of traffic. Lower animal sand vegetation encroaching on the  cities. No sapient life-forms registering at all, Captain. There is no  evidence of natural disaster, yet there are vast numbers of unburied  corpses in all cities.  All dead, Captain. They have annihilated each other totally.  None at all, sir.  Where can he go?  (Bele leaves)  Captain, I have located them on ship's sensors. Bele is chasing  Lokai on deck three. Bele is passing recreation room three, approaching  the crewmen's lounge. Lokai is running past the crewmen's lounge. Lokai  has just arrived on deck five. Passing recreation room three.  (Lokai beams himself away)  Negative, Captain. Transporter room is clear. However, there is  a life-form materialising on the planet. It is Lokai. He is back on  Cheron.  It is Bele, Captain. And another life-form has appeared on  Cheron.  To expect sense from two mentalities of such extreme viewpoints  is not logical.  Not to Lokai and Bele. All that matters to them is their hate. 
Governor.  Governor, you indicated one additional inmate since our last  visit, making a total of fifteen. Is that correct?  A total of fifteen incurably insane out of billions is not what  I would call an excessive figure. Who is the new inmate?  She sounds rational enough, Captain.  Very well indeed, thank you, Captain.  (muttering) If you could create a diversion, I might be able to  find the control room and open the force field.  I find it mildly interesting and somewhat nostalgic, if I  understand the use of that word.  Yes. It is somewhat reminiscent of the dances that Vulcan  children do in nursery school. Of course, the children are not so well  co-ordinated.  (Marta's dance brings her up close and personal with both Garth and  Kirk.)  On what, precisely, is our friendship to be based?  How could you, a Starship fleet Captain, believe that a  Federation crew would blindly obey your order to destroy the entire  Antos race, a people famous for their benevolence and peaceful  pursuits?  Captain Kirk speaks somewhat figuratively and with undue  emotion. However, what he says is logical and I do, in fact, agree with  it.  Please forgive me, but exactly where is your fleet?  Captain Garth  As you wish. At any rate, you must be aware of the fact that you  are attempting to recreate the disaster which resulted in your becoming  an inmate in this place.  On the contrary. You were treated with justice, and with  compassion which you failed to show towards any of your intended  victims. Logically, therefore, one must assume  She seems to have worked out an infallible method for assuring  permanent male fidelity. Interesting.  Thank you, Captain. (draws a phaser) We're now armed. I presume  we shall try to reach the control room.  Force field is now off, Captain.  Captain, I suggest you return to the ship at once. Your safety  is vital to the Enterprise.  I also request permission to remain here in charge of the  security team when they beam down.  Mister Scott, the Captain's life is in immediate danger. Beam  him aboard at once. The security team will be entrusted to me.  He's waiting for the proper reply, Captain.  Give him the countersign, Captain.  Queen to queen's level three.  Arranging to beam down a security team. Are there any  objections?  Fascinating. What maneuver did we use to defeat the Romulan  vessel near Tau Ceti?  Agreed, Captain. Captains. Gentlemen, whichever one of you is  Captain Garth must at this moment be expending a great deal of energy  to maintain the image of Captain Kirk. That energy level cannot be  maintained indefinitely, and I have time.  (Spock pulls a chair towards him to sit down, and Kirk 2 attacks him.  Then the two Kirk's wrestle each other. Finally one is holding the  chair over the other's head, ready to smash it down on his helpless  victim.)  Captain Kirk, I presume.  Spock to Enterprise.  Queen to king's level one.  [Treatment room] (The inmates are getting their jabs.)  I am Mister Spock, science officer on a Starship.  Yes, Captain.  It was not impossible, Captain. Our presence here is proof of  that.  The interval of uncertainty was actually fairly brief, Captain.  It only seemed long to you. I was waiting for a victor in the hand to  hand struggle, which I assumed would be Captain Garth. Because of your  depleted condition. Failing a resolution to the struggle, I was forced  to use other means to make my determination. 
It is possible that Captain Kirk  materialised on some other part of Gideon.  To beam down to your council chamber.  Co-ordinates.  On the bridge of the Enterprise, Mister Scott.  Three to beam up, Mister Scott. [Captain's quarters]
Indications are a storm, Captain, although I've never seen one  of such great intensity or strange confirmation.  All sensor readings are at maximum calibration.  It is definitely doing so, Captain. Therefore it cannot be a  phenomenon of nature.  Some equipment was temporarily out of order. My sensors were  inoperative.  None, Captain.  Captain, it was not a storm.  Only of the result, not of the cause. In each case, a different  area of the brain was affected. Our voluntary nerve functions were  under some form of pressure.  Attack might be a more precise formulation, Captain.  It is of little consequence, Captain. Memory Alpha has no  protective shields.  None, Captain. When the library complex was assembled, shielding  was considered inappropriate to its totally academic purpose. Since the  information on the Memory planet is available to everyone, special  protection was deemed unnecessary.  It varies with the number of scholars, researchers, and  scientists from the various Federation planets who are using the  computer complex.  Sensors give no readings of generated energy from Memory Alpha,  Captain.  None.  A disaster for the galaxy, Captain. The central brain is  damaged. The memory core is burned out. The loss to the galaxy may be  irretrievable.  A very faint life reading in the immediate vicinity, Captain.  Negative.  The attack was thorough.  Lieutenant, I assure you that unexplained phenomenon was headed  away from the planet. It is probably seeking other victims.  No known conditions in space would support that type of natural  phenomenon.  I'm having difficulty with the ship's sensors. They seem to be  under selective attack by the phenomenon as the unfortunate occupants  of Memory Alpha were.  Ship's sensors are operating at the moment. Perhaps the elusive  creature will now reveal something about itself. [Engineering] Negative, Captain. Maintaining its distance. However, it is  matching each manoeuvre we execute, and I am receiving increasing  magnitude of energy.  Not what is it, Captain. What are they? There are ten distinct  life units within it, all powerfully alive and vital.  Impossible to determine without programming for computer  analysis.  I do not believe the Enterprise shields would prove an effective  defence.  Captain, we are dealing with a community of life units. Their  attack is in the form of brain waves directed against the brain, which  is most compatible.  Perhaps it did not understand.  It appears so.  Not directly.  Negative, Captain. I have not been able to gather sufficient  data for that. Captain, there is only one possible defence. If we can  find an environment which is deadly to the alien form.  I am, Captain. I have fed all obtainable data to the main  computer. It should be ready to supply whatever conclusions are  possible.  Doctor McCoy, according to your records, Lieutenant Romaine  showed no abnormal telepathic powers.  And you are sure that this is the correct slide?  Gentlemen, it also happens to be tape H, the impulse tracking  obtained from the alien life units.  As I said, Captain, this is the tracking obtained during the  last shielded run. Computer, run a detailed comparison brain circuitry  patterns, tape D and tape H.  Fascinating.  Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. There is an identity of minds  taking place  between the alien beings and the mind of Lieutenant Romaine. Their  thoughts are becoming hers. [Bridge] At their present force, they will get through the shields this  time, Captain.  She will, unless we are able to complete what the captain has  planned.  Captain, we must deal with them directly, now, while she still  retains partial identity. We can speak to them. They will answer using  her voice.  That is one of the planets where all humanoid life was  destroyed.  They will not accept their own deaths.  Captain, if we cannot complete the plan, they will carry out  their threat.  The weightless state has become their natural condition.  We may tax Mister Scott's patience, Doctor.  Particularly where humans are involved, Doctor.  Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. While the truth was difficult  to accept, when it was revealed, the girl reacted well. I would say her  struggle in this experience would strengthen her entire ego structure.  You mean, love as motivation? Humans do claim a great deal for  that particular emotion. I suppose it is possible. However  Logical. 
This troubled planet is a place of the most violent  contrasts. Those who receive the rewards are totally separated from  those who shoulder the burdens. It is not a wise leadership. Here on  Stratos, everything is incomparably beautiful and pleasant. The High  Advisor's charming daughter Droxine, particularly so. The name Droxine  seems appropriate for her.  I wonder, can she retain such purity and sweetness of mind and be aware  of the life of the people on the surface of the planet? There, the  harsh life in the mines is instilling the people with a bitter hatred.  The young girl who led the attack against us when we beamed down was  filled with the violence of desperation. If the lovely Droxine knew of  the young miner's misery, I wonder how the knowledge would affect her.  (Spock hears a sound and goes into the next room. Droxine is preparing  refreshments.)  Spock here. We've been trying to make contact, Captain. Is  anything wrong?  They are inseparably close to one  another. We cannot transport one [Bridge] However, let me remind you, we have  only five hours left to  (Kirk closes his communicator)  [Transporter room]
I am not receiving, Mister Chekov. Spock to Chekov. Repeat,  I am not receiving. 
Strange. Readings indicate a life form in the vicinity,  apparently human. Yet ship's sensors indicated this planet was  uninhabited.  Did you say your planet, sir?  Mister Flint, unless you are certain, I would suggest you  refrain from a most useless experiment.  Are you a student of history, sir?  Then you live here alone.  It would seem logical to do so for the moment.  This is the most splendid private collection of art I've ever  seen, and the most unique. The majority are the works of Leonardo da  Vinci, Renaissance period, some of the works of Reginald Pollack, 20th  century, and even a sten from Marcus Two. [Sitting room] Thank you, Doctor. I will have a brandy.  If I appear distracted, it is because of what I have seen. I am  close to experiencing an unaccustomed emotion.  Envy. None of these da Vinci paintings has ever been catalogued  or reproduced. They are unknown works, all apparently authentic to the  last brush stroke and use of materials. As undiscovered da Vinci’s,  they would be priceless.  Most strange. A man of Flint's obvious wealth and impeccable  taste scarcely needs to hang fakes. Yet my tricorder analysis indicates  that the canvas and pigments used are of contemporary origin.  Indeed. I would appreciate such a talk. It is an interest of  mine.  Irillium will render the antitoxin inert and useless.  Captain. Something else which is rather extraordinary. This  waltz I just played is by Johannes Brahms.  Captain, it is written in manuscript. In original manuscript, in  Brahms' own hand, which I recognise. It is totally unknown, definitely  the work of Brahms, and yet unknown.  Fortunately, the robot did not detect my presence and deactivate  my phaser. [Living room] Fascinating.  Since we are dependent on Mister Flint for the ryetalyn,  Captain, may I respectfully suggest that you pay less attention to the  young lady if you should encounter her again. Our host's interests do  not appear to be confined to art and science.  Strongly indicated.  It does appear to defy the male logic as I understand it.  We have still a greater mystery, Captain. I was able to run a  tricorder scan on Mister Flint. He is human, but there are certain  biophysical peculiarities. Some body function readings are  disproportionate. For one thing, extreme age is indicated on the order  of six thousand years.  I shall programme the readings through Doctor McCoy's medical  computer when we return to the ship.  We must commence ryetalyn injections within two hours and  eighteen minutes or the epidemic will prove fatal to us all.  Captain, I would suggest that our immediate concern is the  ryetalyn.  Interesting. Obviously, Mister Flint is not yet ready for us to  depart.  The captain wanted us to wait here. [Living room] Picking up tricorder readings, Captain. Apparently the ryetalyn  is behind this door.  Captain, I shall get the ryetalyn.  There may be dangers within.  Let me go alone, Captain.  Your collection of Leonardo da Vinci masterpieces, Mister Flint,  they appear to have been recently painted  on contemporary canvas with contemporary materials. And on your piano,  a waltz by Johannes Brahms, an unknown work in manuscript, written in  modern ink. Yet absolutely authentic, as are your paintings.  And da Vinci?  How many other names shall we call you?  You were born?  Your wealth and your intellect are the product of centuries of  acquisition. You knew the greatest minds in history.  You wanted a perfect, ultimate woman, as brilliant, as immortal  as yourself. Your mate for all time.  I had hoped I was wrong.  We have discovered what he is, Captain.  We can remain silent.  What will you feel for him after we are gone?  Captain, your primitive impulses will not alter the  circumstances.  No, you're not, for she is not.  (Flint thumps Kirk, then repeatedly throws him across the room)  Gentlemen, I urge you to stop. There is a danger.  She loved you, Captain. And you, too, Mister Flint, as a mentor,  even as a father. There was not enough time for her to adjust to the  awful power and contradictions of her new-found emotions. She could not  bear to hurt either of you.  The joys of love made her human, and the agonies of love destroyed her.  [Kirk's quarters] The epidemic is reduced and no longer a threat. The Enterprise  is on course five one three mark seven, as you ordered.  Your report, Doctor.  On that day, I shall mourn. Does he know?  Indeed.  Goodnight, Doctor.  Forget. <Back  to the episode listing Star Trek ® and related  marks are trademarks of CBS Studios Inc.  Copyright © 1966, Present.

I still read a suggestion of carbon cycle life forms on the  planet surface, Captain.  Agreed. Mister Sulu, switch to the planet area I have under  observation.  Which would indicate a considerable civilisation there.  Our readings could be false, Captain, perhaps caused by some  natural phenomena.  We're being scanned, Captain. A deep probe, incredibly swift.  (The lights come back up, and the planet disappears from the  viewscreen)  Fascinating.  They did scan us and our vessel, Captain, and doubtless obtained  sufficient information to present this illusion.  Small change occurring there, Captain.  An area of approximately one thousand square kilometres. It  measures completely Earth-like.  Fascinating. For a moment, it appeared almost mineral. Like  living rock with heavy fore claws. It’s settling down now to completely  human readings.  Band honours ready, Captain.  We do, sir. Six hundred forty three miles, two thousand twenty  one feet, two point zero four inches at this moment, using your  old-style measurements.  It is basic to the Vulcan philosophy, sir. The combination of a  number of things to make existence worthwhile.  More that direction, Engineer.  I am, Doctor. I am observing the alien.  It would be illogical. With such abilities, they could as easily  trick us into destroying the entire vessel.  No, I'm not, Doctor. There's no doubt they want us down there  for some hidden purpose. Otherwise, they would have revealed some  logical reason for all of this.  Speculation is unnecessary, Captain. The answer is clear.  President Lincoln has always been a very personal hero to you. What  better way to titillate your curiosity than to make him come alive for  you.  Agreed. I, too, experienced his charm. It is a magnificent work  of duplication.  Captain, since I was included in the invitation to make contact,  I must beam down with you.  Captain. Our phasers and tricorders did not beam down with us.  Undamaged, yet something is preventing them from functioning. [Transporter room] Surak.  The greatest of all who ever lived on our planet, Captain. The  father of all we became.  [Bridge] It is not logical that you are Surak. There is no fact,  extrapolation of fact or theory, which would make possible.  Live long and prosper, image of Surak, father of all we now hold  true.  As I turned and my eyes beheld you, I displayed emotion. I beg  forgiveness.  It may be exactly as explained, Captain. Our concept of good and  evil is strange to them. Perhaps they wish to determine which is  strongest.  I'm all right, Captain. However, I suggest that we prepare  ourselves for another attack.  And if they’re real, Captain?  Yes, Captain.  Captain. Logic dictates that we consider another course.  His convictions are most profound in this matter, Captain.  The captain knows that I have fought at his side before and will  do so now, if need be. However, I too, am a Vulcan, bred to peace. Let  him attempt it.  I deeply respect what he has accomplished.  They're trying to goad us into attacking, Captain. They expect  us to act rashly.  He was aware of what might happen when he went.  You had no choice, Captain. You could not have stopped him.  A Vulcan would not cry out so.  I am not insensitive to it, Captain.  Captain, that is what they are waiting for. They're waiting for  us to attempt a rescue.  No, sir.  Conjecture, Captain, rather than explanation.  It would seem that we were held in the power of creatures able  to control matter and to rearrange molecules in whatever fashion was  desired. So they were able to create images of Surak and Lincoln after  scanning our minds and using their fellow creatures as source matter.  Yes, and Surak. Perhaps in a sense they were real, Captain.  Since they were created out of our own thoughts, how could they be  anything but what we expected them to be? 
The power source we detected is in this building, Captain.  No signs of sapient life forms.  Reports deny that they had any space flight capability. This  appears to be an archive or library of some kind.  Forgive me, sir. It is my fault. I must have miscalculated. Our  readings indicated that there was no one here at all.  Three hours, thirteen minutes.  Exactly what is it that I'm expected to select?  I see. This is a fascinating machine. What is it?  Interesting nomenclature. How does it work? May I  Thank you, Mister Atoz.  (Kirk hears a woman scream from behind a doorway)  Yes, and where is the captain?  [17th Century] Heating this boulder may provide some  temporary heat.  Something's preventing my phaser from operating.  [17th Century] Captain, we hear you, but we cannot see you.  [17th Century] Apparently they've all escaped the  destruction of their world by retreating into its past. [17th Century] Indeed not. We're in a wilderness of arctic characteristics.  There is no library, Captain, at least not  that we can see. We are at the base of an ice cliff. [17th Century] Just before you disappeared, Captain, I  discovered a machine which Mister Atoz called the atavachron. [17th Century] Opening time portals to the past. You cross  through into the period which you were viewing.  I am here, evidently, because I stepped through at the same  instant as Doctor McCoy. [17th Century] We may be in trouble ourselves. We must find shelter.  (They walk on until McCoy collapses)  In this severe cold, we cannot survive much longer.  We go together or not at all.  We go together.  He's suffering from the severity of your weather. Unfortunately,  he is the doctor, not I. I'll avoid giving him any medication at this  time. Perhaps, if he's kept quiet and warm, he may recover naturally.  It is agreeably warm here.  (Their benefactor has pushed back the hood to reveal that it is a young  woman)  I'm called Spock.  Prisoners?  Yes, we came through the time portal, but not as prisoners. We  were sent here by mistake.  That is true. I am not from the world you know at all. My home  is a planet millions of light years away.  Listen to me. I am firmly convinced that I do exist. I am  substantial. You are not imagining this.  McCoy. McCoy, wake up.  No, we are still in the Ice Age, but safe for the moment.  Doctor, you're in no condition to get up. You lie down and rest.  I shall attempt to find the captain.  He's our commanding officer and our friend.  He did not come with us. He was sent through the time portal to  another period in history much later than this one. If I am to find  him, there is only one possible avenue. Zarabeth, will you show me  where the time portal is?  Yes, that is true. If I leave him, there's a chance he may never  regain the ship. He would then be marooned in this time period. But he  is no longer in danger of death, so my primary duty to him has been  discharged. If I remain here, no one of our party would be able to aid  Captain Kirk.  It should be an equation. I should be able to resolve this  problem logically. Perhaps it has something to do with the atavachron.  If only I knew more about how it worked. Zarabeth, you said that you  were brought here as a prisoner. May I ask  I remember that name from the history tapes in the library. Zor  Kahn the Tyrant.  Zarabeth, I must return to Mister Atoz and the atavachron. We  will carry Doctor McCoy, and you must come with us. I will send you and  the doctor to the ship, and I shall search for Captain Kirk.  You cannot go back?  Come, Doctor, back to bed.  It is impossible to look for him, Doctor. We cannot go back.  Zarabeth explained it to me. When we came through the time  portal, it altered our physiological structure. If we attempt to return  to the library, we shall die.  Yes, Doctor, we are trapped. Just as Jim is trapped wherever he  is.  Captain's log, stardate 5943.9. The people of this  time believe in witches, and witchcraft is what I've been accused of.  Five witnesses heard McCoy's voice speak to me and thought it was an  evil spirit. From what I know of witchcraft trials, I don't have much  chance unless I can get to the prosecutor.  [17C Jail] Really?  Doctor McCoy is making excellent progress.  And known as the worst patient in the entire crew of the  Enterprise.  Five thousand years in the future.  Who knows. We can only hope that he is well, wherever he is.  What was there to do?  We've been through all that, Doctor. What's the point of  rehashing that subject? We can't get back. Wasn't that clear to you?  Then perhaps you were too ill to understand what can't get back  means.  Then I'll repeat it for you. Get this through your head. We  can't get back. That means we are trapped here in this planet's past  just as we are, and we'll stay here for the rest of our lives. Now do  you understand?  The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago.  I don't like that. I don't think I ever did, and now I'm sure.  Nothing that shouldn't have happened long ago.  I'm sorry. I know of no way to return you to your own time.  Yes. I know what it is like.  If it pleases you. This is animal flesh?  Naturally, because of the climate. What is the source of heat in  the shelter?  Excellent. Then it will be possible to build a greenhouse of  sorts. Meanwhile, this will have to do as the only source of  nourishment.  (He takes a bite)  But he evidently intended that you continue living.  But insensitive, to send such a beautiful woman into exile. The  cold must've affected me more than I realised. Please pay no attention.  I'm not myself. I'm behaving disgracefully. I have eaten animal flesh  and I have enjoyed it. What is wrong with me? I tell you you're  beautiful. But you are beautiful. Is it so wrong to tell you so?  You are beautiful. More beautiful than any dream of beauty I've  ever known.  (He lays her down and .... sets the scene for many fan-fictions) [Library] (Kirk wakes up lying on a sled, which Atoz is  pushing towards the portal)  I've given you the facts, Doctor.  You were told the truth. If Zarabeth is the source, what  difference does it make?  She would not jeopardise other lives.  What are you doing to her?  (Spock pins McCoy against the cave wall)  This is impossible. Impossible. I am a Vulcan.  My ancestors are barbarians. Warlike barbarians.  I've lost myself. I do not know who I am. Can we go back?  There's no portal here, Doctor. It's hopeless.  You're too ill to remain out here any longer. Give it up. [Library] (Atoz views another disc)  This must be it. [Library] You start ahead, Doctor. I do not wish to part from you.  How much time do we have? [Library] There's no further need to observe me, Doctor. As you can see,  I've returned to the present in every sense.  Yes, it happened. But that was five thousand years ago. And she  is dead now. Dead and buried. Long ago. 
You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall  do everything in my power against you. 
That is a very intriguing question. Scanners show no  disturbances in this quadrant, Captain.  Doctor, didn't the boy make any reference at all to Thasians?  Charlie's very existence proves in fact there must be some  intelligent form of life on Thasus. He could not possibly have survived  alone. The ship's food concentrates would have been exhausted in a year  or so.  Probes of Thasus indicate very little edible plant life.  Affirmative, Captain.  Picking up some debris on our scanners, Captain.  The debris is what's left of the Antares.  Your mind is not on the game, Captain. Check. The Antares?  My own concern is more immediate. The boy.  He seemed to know what happened to the Antares before we did.  And again, check.  Your illogical approach to chess does have its advantages on  occasion, Captain.  As you wish. At any rate, the game is yours.  The principles of three-dimensional chess are basically  mathematic, Charlie. You put the white here and the black on the  secondary level.  Very well. (just three moves later) That was a mistake, Charlie.    Checkmate.  If you'll excuse me.  (Spock leaves. Charlie melts the white chess pieces.) [Corridor] Thasians have been referred to in our  records as having the power to transmute objects or render substances  invisible.  It has generally been regarded as legend, but Charlie does seems to  possess this same power.  Agreed.  The probability is he's responsible for the destruction of the  Antares, which would indicate a total disregard for human life.  And with a weapon in him which could destroy you or anyone,  anywhere on this ship.  Agreed. The struggle must remain between you and him. Should any  of us interfere  (Charlie enters under guard)  We're in the hands of an adolescent.  [Bridge] Yes, sir. There's a Tyger, tyger, burning bright in the forest  of the night.  I'm trying to Saturn rings around my head, down a road that's  Martian red.  Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered, weak and weary.  Jim, he'll soon reach a point where he won't back down.  My legs. They're broken.  I'll activate the force field myself. You  can return to your section.  Out of the question.  Not so far as we know.  Captain, the navigation console is clear now. The ship is  answering the helm.  Sensors show there something's there, Captain. Deflectors  indicate no solid substance. 
Still no answer from Earth Outpost number two, Captain, and  now number three's gone silent.  Earth Outpost four reports they're under attack. A space  vessel, identity unknown.  As you may recall from your histories,  this conflict was fought, [Engineering] By our standards today, with primitive  atomic weapons and in primitive space vessels [Bridge]
