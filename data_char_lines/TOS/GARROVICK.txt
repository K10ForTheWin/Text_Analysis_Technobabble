Ensign Garrovick reporting, sir.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir, but I don't expect any special treatment on that  account.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir. We were good friends, graduated the Academy  together.  Yes, I am, sir.  Yes, sir.  [Planet surface] Reading is changing, sir.    Dikironium reading now, sir. Bearing ninety four mark seven,  angle of elevation six degrees. Holding steady.  Yes, sir.  I'd say it measured from ten to sixty cubic metres, sir. It  varied in size, fluctuated as it moved.  It was like a, a gaseous cloud. Parts of it I could see  through. Other parts were more dense.  Did I what, sir?  No, sir.  No, sir. I was furthest away from it. It seemed to come out  of nowhere, hovered for a moment, then moved toward my men. It was  fast, incredibly fast.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir, I did.  About twenty yards, sir.  Yes. I, er, well, I didn't fire while it was hovering, sir.  No, sir. I didn't exactly freeze.  Well, I was startled for a second. And then by the time I  fired, the thing was already moving.  No, sir.  I only hesitated for a moment, sir. I'm sorry.  Yes, sir. (leaves)  I'm not hungry.  What's happening?  What do you mean, out of it? I caused it. You know that,  too, don't you? If I'd fired my phaser quickly enough on Argus Ten,  this wouldn't have happened.  I told you, Christine, I'm not hungry.  Captain, request permission to return to my post.  (He is totally ignored.)  Come in.  Yes, sir.  Mister Spock, it's very kind of you to come here  Sir, it's coming through the vent.  (into intercom) Sir, the creature's in  my cabin. It's got Mister Spock. [Bridge] I must have jammed the vent control when I hit it.  He saved my life, Captain. I should be lying dead in there,  not him.  (The cabin door opens.)  Yes, sir.  Yes, I'm sorry, sir. I know I was confined to quarters, but  when the alert sounded  I don't understand, sir.  Ineffective, Captain. I realise, Captain, you did everything  you could do. I know that. It's just that nothing works against a  monster  that can do the things that thing does.  I delayed firing.  Yes, Captain. Thank you, sir. [Bridge] Yes, sir.  I'd like permission to go with you, sir.  Just think, Captain, less than one ounce of antimatter here  is more powerful than ten thousand cobalt bombs.  Aye, sir.  (He primes and sets it on the anti-grav unit.)  Captain, look!  (The cloud is already over the bottle of blood. Within moments it is  empty.)  The haemoplasm. The bait's already taken.  Sir, that thing only feeds on blood.  Captain, you're not going to be the bait.  Yes, sir.  (A quick karate chop knocks Kirk down but not out. He lands a couple of  punches on Garrovick.)  I can smell it, Captain. It's sickening. Honey sweet.  Thank you, sir. I would. <Back  to the episode listing Star Trek ® and related  marks are trademarks of CBS Studios Inc.  Copyright © 1966, Present.
