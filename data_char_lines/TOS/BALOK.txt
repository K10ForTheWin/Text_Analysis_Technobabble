And trespassed into our star systems. This is Balok,  Commander of the flagship Fesarius of the First Federation. Your  vessel, obviously the product of a primitive and savage civilisation,  having ignored a warning buoy and having then destroyed it, has  demonstrated your intention is not peaceful. We are now considering the  disposition of your ship and the life aboard.  No further communication will be accepted. If there is the  slightest hostile move, your vessel will be destroyed immediately.  Your recorder marker has been destroyed. You have been  examined. Your ship must be destroyed. We make assumption you have a  deity or deities or some such beliefs which comfort you. We therefore  grant you ten Earth time periods known as minutes to make preparations.  Four minutes.  Three minutes.  You now have two minutes.  This is the Commander of the Fesarius.  The destruction of your vessel has been delayed. We will  relent in your destruction only if we have proof of your corbomite  device.  It has been decided that I will conduct you to a planet of  the First Federation which is capable of sustaining your lifeform.  There you will disembark and be interned. Your ship will be destroyed,  of course.  Do not be deceived by the size of this pilot vessel. It has  an equal potential to destroy your vessel.  So that you may sustain your gravity and atmosphere, your  systems are now open. Escape is impossible since you are being taken  under our power to your destination. Any move to escape or destroy this  ship will result in the instant destruction of the Enterprise and  everyone aboard.
