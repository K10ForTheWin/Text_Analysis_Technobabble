We believe what you say, Captain Kirk, but our position has not  altered. The Halkan Council cannot permit your Federation to mine  dilithium crystals on our planet.  We accept that your Federation is benevolent at present, but the  future is always in question. Our dilithium crystals represent awesome  power. Wrongful use of that power, even to the extent of the taking of  one life, would violate our history of total peace. To prevent that, we  would die, Captain. As a race, if necessary.  The council will meditate further, but do not be hopeful of any  change. Captain, you do have the might to force the crystals from us,  of course.  We do not resist you.  Twelve years, Captain Kirk, or twelve thousand.  We are ethically compelled to deny your demand for our dilithium  crystals, for you would use their power to destroy.  To preserve what we are.
