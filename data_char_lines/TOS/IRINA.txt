Pavel Andreievich. I had thought we might encounter each other.  I had heard.  Look at yourself, Pavel.  Why did you?  Yes. Oh, we should not tear at each other so, Pavel. We should  meet again in joy. Today when I first knew it was your ship that  followed us, I thought of you and wondered what I would find. And I  remembered so much. In spite of that uniform, I still see the same  Pavel I used to know. [Rec Room] Are you happy in what you do?  Then I accept what you do.  It was you who went.  I stayed in the city, with friends.  I did.  Because you disapproved of me, Just as you do now. Oh, Pavel,  you have always been like this. So correct. And inside, the struggle  not to be. Give in to yourself. You will be happier. You'll see.  Am I allowed in?  I have been looking for you, Pavel. What room is this?  What's it for?  To apologise. I should not have teased you. It was cruel.  Oh, but it does. It is against everything I believe in.  And I do not like having you angry with me, or disapproving.  What are you working on?  Oh, now you are teasing me.  Do you know all these things?  They tell you what to do, and you do what they tell you.  I could never obey a computer.  Not different. What I wanted to be. There is nothing wrong in  doing what you want.  (Chekov gives in, and kisses her)  Everything can be handled from auxiliary control. The computers  contain all the information we need. We can do it.  Pavel said they would. Our original course must have been  somewhat in error.  What will that do to them? What is it?  Sound pitched that high doesn't stun, it destroys. I remember  when we read in the text that it  It was so beautiful. [Bridge] And I was coming to say goodbye to you. (a kiss) Be incorrect,  occasionally.  Occasionally.  Thank you.  (Irina leaves)
