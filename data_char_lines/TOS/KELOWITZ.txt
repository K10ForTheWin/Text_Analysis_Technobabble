Similar to life forms discovered on Hansen's Planet, but  much larger. Ten, twelve feet in height.  Ensign O'Neal got a spear through the body  before we even knew they were around. Lieutenant lmmamura has a  dislocated shoulder and severe lacerations, but he'll make it all  right. Captain, the creatures are all over the place. If the Galileo is  down on that planet, I  Aye, aye, Captain.  (Commissioner Ferris enters) 
They got Lang, sir.  No, sir.  If I were them, I'd go to the high ground on the right. I  make it twelve hundred yards, azimuth eighty seven. It's pretty close  for one of these little jewels, Captain. 
What exactly are we looking for anyway,  sir?  (opening up the barn door) Hey.  No cows. This barn isn't even built for them, Just for  storage.  Come on. Break it up. Break it up. [Pasture] (McCoy is resting under a tree, with a tall glass  of mint julep in his hand.)
