Please, I know nothing about it. I didn't kill anyone.  Morla of Cantaba Street, Prefect. I was there. I have nothing to  hide.  I know it was wrong, but I just couldn't help myself. I loved  her, and when she went over to the table with these men, I could not  stand to watch, so I left and went home.  Prefect, I didn't kill anyone. I couldn't.  But that doesn't mean anything, Captain, with a room that small.  The lights were out. Anyone would've had time to kill the lady.  I'm not sure. Walking home, I assume. I was angry.  I've never done violence in my life. I don't think I could.  You've got to believe me. I wouldn't kill her. I couldn't. I loved her,  and she loved me.  No.  No.  You mean it could kill us all?
