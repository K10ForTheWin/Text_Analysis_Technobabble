You dirty thing. Let go of me!  (She gets spanked with a sword)  Oh, thank you, man. I thought I'd be  limbered sure when that gull caught me cutting his purse.  Oh, I took you to be an angler, but you're none of us, are ya?  Well, you're a bully fine coe for all of that. What a handsome dish ya  served them, the coxcombs.  I'm game, love. Lead and I'll follow. Where's library?  What's with you, man? Let's make off before  coxcombs come with shoulder clappers.  Oh, I think the rum gull must've kicked you in the head. Come  on, love. I know a leech who'll ask no questions.  Mercy on us. It's spirits.  It's spirits.  He's a witch!  He speaks to unseen spirits. He's a witch! You heard the voices!    You're a witch. He cast a spell. He made me steal against my  wish.  Witch! Witch! Witch! They'll burn ya.  [Cave]
