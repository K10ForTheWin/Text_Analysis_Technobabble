Scanning area, sir.  One emergency signal, sir.  Are you hungry?  What would you like? 
Ready, sir. 
Transporter and communications?  Aye sir.  I've located the landing party, but one of them seems separated  from the other four.  Yes, sir.  What for, sir?  Right away, sir. [Temple] (Apollo reappears on his throne, Carolyn standing  by his side.) 
Ready to beam, sir.  (But the monster fires a ray at them, everyone goes flying and smoke  comes out of a transporter pad.)  [Bridge] It's a power drain somewhere, sir. I almost lost you.  Bridge. Transporter malfunction. [Bridge] Energising. Bridge, it's shorted out again. [Jefferies tube] Bridge, we got him through! [Bridge]
No need to get excited, Captain. I'll do it.  (They lay Hengist on the pad.)  You didn't have to shove me, Mister Spock. I'd have gotten round  to it.  (McCoy and Scott enter, with big grins.) 
It's no use, Mister Scott. We're just barely  holding our own. [Planet surface] No, sir. We're slipping.  Sir!  It's no good, sir. There's only a few systems responding. [Village]
Trouble, sir.  (Four figures start to materialise, then disappear again. The image of  Enterprise in orbit reverses itself. Finally, four figures solidify,  wearing strange uniforms with gold sashes. Uhura's midriff is bare.)  Yes, sir.  But I tried, Mister Spock, I tried.  But Mister Spock, I  No, Mister Spock.  No, Mister Spock! I tried. I really tried.  (Spock places the device on Kyle's collar bone, and he writhes in  agony. When it is removed, he collapses.)  Captain's log, stardate unknown. During an ion  storm, my landing party has beamed back to the Enterprise and found it  and the personnel aboard changed. The ship is subtly altered  physically. Behaviour and discipline has become brutal, savage.  [Transporter room] Mister Spock.  The power beam jumped for a moment, sir, as the landing party was  about to materialise. I never saw it happen before.  No, Mister Spock. Before. 
Aye, sir.  Captain, deflector shields just snapped on.  Warp three, sir.  Magnification factor three, sir.  Warp factor one, sir.  Aye, aye, sir.  One hundred thousand kilometres, sir.  Aye, aye, sir.  Six, five, four, three, two, one.  (The ship shudders.)  Shuttlecraft away, sir.  Impact five seconds.  (There's a big bump and people are thrown all over the place. Then  there is calm.)  Seven minutes, sir.  Forward thrust off, sir.  Backing out, sir.  Almost out. We're approaching the membrane,  sir.  Prepare to receive shuttlecraft. Received shuttlecraft. Hangar  doors closed. Hangar deck pressurising. 
Something's interfering with the transporter signal. I have her  co-ordinates, but she's suspended in transit.
