(a woman in yellow uniform) Mister Spock. The planet's gone!  [Planet surface] No debris of any kind, sir. I've made two full scans. If the  planet had broken up, there'd be some sign.  But what bothers me is the stars, Mister Spock.  Yes, sir. They're wrong.  Yes, Mister Spock. Look. Now here's a replay of the star pattern  just before the explosion.  It doesn't make any sense. But somehow I'd say that in a flash  we've been knocked one thousand light years away from where we were.  Already plotted and laid in, sir.  We're holding warp eight point four, sir. If  we can maintain it, our estimated time of arrival is eleven and one  half solar hours.  Mister Spock, speed is increased to warp eight point eight.  Aye, sir. Warp seven. Mister Spock, our speed has increased to  warp eight point nine and still climbing.  Aye, sir. I'll jettison the pod at the first sign of trouble.  Yes, sir. Warp eleven point nine.  Fifty seven seconds to go.  Warp thirteen point two, sir.  Eight seconds, seven seconds  [Crawlway] One. Mister Spock, now. Warp fourteen point  one. Warp fourteen.  Warp thirteen point nine and dropping.
