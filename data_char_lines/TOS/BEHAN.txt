Ike! Ike! Frank! Billy! Tom! (shakes Kirk's hand) Ike, I was  afraid you weren't going to make it.  I knew you wouldn't let them scare you away. They're a bunch of  hot air if you ask me.  Now they're going to have to fight after the way they shot off  their mouths.  Funny. That's what I like about you, lke. You always see the  funny side.  Nobody can say Johnny Behan doesn't have a sense of humour.  (walks on)  You looking for somebody?  Stop it? Who wants to stop it? I sure don't. You don't. You  didn't yesterday.  Since when does a Clanton run crawling to the law for help?  (indicating gun) From this. You and your boys set up this whole  thing to take care of the Earps. It's a little late to decide you don't  have the belly for it.  Don't talk nonsense. The people in this town are counting on you  to get rid of the Earps for them.  You can talk that way after what the Earps did to Billy today?  Nobody in this town will deny you your right to your revenge.  You listen to me. Get down to the OK Corral. Keep out of sight.  When the Earps come looking, you bushwhack them.  It's the only way.  Kill them any way you can! There'll be no questions asked.  Honest. I guarantee that! [Saloon]
