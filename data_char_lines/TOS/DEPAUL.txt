Mister Sulu, photon torpedoes locked on.  Yes, sir.  Twenty two point three parsecs beyond latest chart limit, sir.  Yes, sir.  Two two seven nine pl, sir. Uncharted solar system at two four  six six pm.  No, sir. He's headed away from it. 
All stations reporting. Deflector screens  rigged at full power. Phaser crews ready. Sensors reading zero.  Correction. Mister Scott.  Sensor readings just shot off the scale.  Screens firm, sir. Extremely powerful sonic vibrations.  Decibels eighteen to the twelfth power. If those screens weren't up,  we'd be totally disrupted by now.  Mister Scott, disruptor beams are no longer hitting us.
