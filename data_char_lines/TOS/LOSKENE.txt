I am Commander Loskene. You are trespassing in  a territorial annex of the Tholian Assembly. You must leave this area  immediately.  We claim this territory and are prepared to  use force, if necessary, to protect our property.  I find no evidence of a disabled ship. My  instruments indicate ours are the only two vessels in this area.  Very well, Enterprise. In the interest of  interstellar amity, we will wait precisely one hour and fifty  three minutes. But be correct. We do not tolerate deceit.  [Medical Lab] (A bench full of bottles, and red stuff dribbling  through curvy pipes.)
