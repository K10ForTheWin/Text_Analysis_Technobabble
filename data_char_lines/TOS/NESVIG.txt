Mister Cromwell.  Lock the elevator at the top, Lieutenant. Time to get out of  here.  These are all they were carrying.  You've got a chance, and I'll offer it only this once. The  slightest possible charges will be brought against you if you identify  yourselves and tell us why you're here.  What is it?  How could the warhead arm itself?  You can destroy it, of course.
