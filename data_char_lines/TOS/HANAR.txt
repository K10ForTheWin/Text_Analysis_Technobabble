Drea, Tomar, report. [Life support] Rojan, Hanar here. [Planet surface] The ship is ours. We control the bridge, engineering, and  life support systems.  All is proceeding according to plan, Rojan.  Tomar has examined the ship. The modifications are underway.  It is an undisciplined environment. One cannot control it. Yet  there are things of interest.  Since the ship was designed to sustain these forms, we have  little choice.  What do you want, human?  This illness came on him rather suddenly. Is it not unusual?  Stand away from the door. (enters the cell for a closer look) I  will have you beamed aboard.  Please articulate.  What are you doing?  How many more of these?  I see no reason for you to refer to yourself in the plural. [Scott's quarters] Rojan, I want to talk to you.  First, I do not like the way responsibility and duty has been  portioned out to us.  That is my second quarrel with you.  And further, I do not care much for the way you run this ship.
