They came back all right, sir. In my opinion, the transporters  are now safe for human transport.  Captain, it's a big planet. It'll be sheer luck if our landing  parties find anything. 
Sir, this is a security area. What are you  doing here?  Who gave you clearance? I haven't been notified. You're  cross-circuiting the. (struggle) Whose tapes are these? 
Sir, you shouldn't be in here. 
Security Chief here, sir.  Kirk; All decks alert. Captain Christopher is not in his assigned  quarters. He may be trying to escape the ship. I want a man outside the  transporter room immediately. I'm heading there myself. [Corridor] (Christopher gets the jump on a hapless red-shirt  and takes his phaser, then steps into)  [Transporter room]
Hey, Doc, I'm ready to energise. Everything okay with those  plants?  Well, sure, if you want. 
Captain, Doctor McCoy has beamed  himself down to the planet.
