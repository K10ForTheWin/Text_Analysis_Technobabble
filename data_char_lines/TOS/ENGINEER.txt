Hi.  Is that an order, Lieutenant?  Yes. Ready and waiting.  (They leave, then Lazarus follows.) [Corridor] (Lazarus has some sort of seizure and we get the  nebula effect, the fight, and then... he has a plaster on his forehead  again. Kirk and McCoy exit the turbolift and spot him.)  Lieutenant Masters, Captain's calling.  Come on. You, too, Lieutenant.  We've got to get out of here. The whole thing might blow!  (He bustles her out into the corridor.) [Corridor] Under control, sir, but it couldn't have started by itself. 
Warp eight, Mister Scott, and increasing.  Warp nine.  Warp 10, Mister Scott.  It just won't stop, Mister Scott. Warp eleven! 
Main relay's out again, Mister Scott. [Bridge]
Emergency increasing, sir. [Bridge]
