We are the law, and do require that you yield to us.  Thievery and purse cutting.  Lord help us. What's that?  Away. Away, spirit, and let honest men approach.  Here. There's the mort. And there's the mort's  henchman.  It's truth, my lord. I heard the spirit talk to him. He answered  and did call it Bones.  Aye, my lord. I'll witness to it.  No supper for you, love. (lets the wench out  of her cell) Come on. Up you go.
