Gentlemen, you don't know what a treat this is for me. It's been  too long since I've had company.  The force field's back in place now. That means you two are trapped  here, and I'm not accepting any excuses for your not dining with me.  It is. The rehabilitation programme isn't progressing too well,  and I have my doubts about the effectiveness of this medicine too.  I'm afraid I have.  Garth. Garth of Izar, a former Starship fleet Captain.  (He calls up a picture on a monitor)  Of course. [Detention area] (Cory leads them down a corridor, using a hand  device to deactivate and reactivate forcefields rather than locking and  unlocking doors.)  Captain Kirk is pressed for time at the moment, Marta.  She's been saying that for days now. Our medical staff can't  figure out why.  (They pass an Andorian and a Tellarite)  Here's Garth. He's been unusually disturbed, and we've had to  impose additional restraint.  (The occupant of the cell is suspended in mid-air, and looks exactly  like their host!)  (in cell) Yes, Jim, I'm Cory. It's true. He tricked you.  (The Cory with Kirk and Spock changes into Garth. He unlocks the other  cells and the occupants come out.)  Captain Garth, listen to me.  All right. There is no help for any of us if that madman is in  command of the Enterprise. He boasts that he's created the most  powerful explosive in the universe, and I believe him.  The people of Antos taught him the techniques of cellular  metamorphosis to restore the destroyed parts of his body.  By himself, he later learned to use the technique to recreate himself  into any form he wished. The first time we knew about it was when a  guard, seeing what he thought was me in Garth's cell, released him.  Don't be a fool, Jim. Go along with him.  It helped many men back to health.  Will intramuscular injection be satisfactory?  How long before it takes effect, Doctor McCoy?
