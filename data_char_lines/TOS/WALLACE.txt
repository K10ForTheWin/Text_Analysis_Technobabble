(a young blonde woman in a pink dress) Yes, Captain.  Well, be a little less the cool, efficient Captain and a  little more the old friend.  Six years, four months, and an odd number of days. You mean  you don't know?  You said it. I didn't. In all those years, I only heard from  you once. A stargram when my husband died. You know, you never asked me  why I got married after we called it off.  I met a man I admired. A great man.  No. Just you.  A few years ago on Aldebaran Three, my  husband and I tried various carbohydrate compounds to slow down the  degeneration of plant life.  Yes, sir. (leaves)  We both go in the same direction.  Look, we know the problem. We know the progress of the  affliction. Therefore, once we find the proper line of research, it's  only logical we find the solution.  No problem is insoluble. Not even ours.  Our situation doesn't have its roots in logic. The heart is  not a logical organ. When I married Theodore Wallace, I thought I was  over you. I was wrong.  What?  What difference does that make?  Twenty six years.  Jim, he was a brilliant man. We were stationed on a lonely  outpost. We were working together. I don't want to talk about him. I  want to talk about us.  I see Captain James Kirk, a man of morality, decency,  handsome, and strong.  Jim, please.  Doctor McCoy, none of our usual radiation therapies will have  any effect on this radiation sickness.  Oh, Jim. I'm sorry. Truly I am.  Everybody understood.  Oh, Jim, will you forgive me? I have work to do.  Doctor, hyronalin is the specific accepted for all radiation  sickness.  Jim.  Jim, if I have to give you a shot  Jim, it could kill you.  The ageing process has stopped. His bodily functions are  getting stronger.  [Bridge]
