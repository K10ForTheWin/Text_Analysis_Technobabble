Yes, sir?  Seemed to read dikironium for a minute, and then I lost it. It's  almost like something out there knows I'm scanning it.  It kind of keeps changing itself into something different. That isn't  possible. Nothing can do that.  (All together now - It's Behind You! The other two security men fall to  the ground, choking in the cloud. Rizzo can't get a clear shot.)  Captain? [Boulder] Captain. [Boulder] Cloud, cloud. [Boulder] Remember. I'm cold. I'm so cold.  Yes. Yes. A smell. A strange smell. It was like being smothered  in honey.  It was trying to draw strength from us. I felt it. It was, it  was, it was there.
