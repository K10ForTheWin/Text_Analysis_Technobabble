Chekov here, sir.  All indicators are dark. 
Captain, contact with alien ship, sir.  Chekov to Captain Kirk. Chekov to Captain Kirk. Urgent.  Captain, we're off course.  That's just it, sir. The ship's taken a new heading all by  itself. 
Seven, six, five [Bridge] Four, three 
Bridge to Captain Kirk.  Mister Baris waiting is on channel E to speak to you, sir.    Aye, sir. Mister Baris is coming on. 
Shuttlecraft approaching with Ambassador Sarek's party.  Estimate arrival one minute.  Standby to recover shuttlecraft. Honour guard to the  hangar deck. [Hangar deck] (As the NCC1701/7 arrives, the honour guard smarted  themselves up outside.)  Bridge to Captain Kirk.  Captain, sensors are registering an unidentified vessel  pacing us. 
No, sir. Control is in auxiliary.  Bridge to Captain Kirk. Do you wish to open communication,  sir? 
Continued scanning, sir. No unusual readings.  Bridge to Captain. Come in.  Point zero four light years ahead. Our phasers won't reach  it, sir.  All decks, stand by. Shock waves.  (The ship is shaken, and still nothing appears on the transporter pad.)   
Bridge to Transporter room. One minute to overhead  position.  We are now locked in synchronous orbit, Mister Scott.  Sensors continue to show the area as completely Earth-like in all  respects. 
Yes, sir.  (Inside the obelisk chamber, Kirk starts to stand and is hit by and  electrical discharge. He collapses across a control panel.) Captain's Log, stardate 4842.6. First Officer Spock  commanding. Numerous search parties and repeated sensor probes of the  area have failed to locate Captain Kirk.  [Obelisk] (Spock is standing where Kirk was when he  disappeared.)
