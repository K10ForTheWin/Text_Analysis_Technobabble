Lieutenant! Have you forgotten how to  salute? (Spock salutes.) Your papers.  Good work, Lieutenant.  Hail to the Fuhrer.  Lieutenant? Better see a doctor. You don't look well. Your  colour.  Lieutenant! Your helmet. Remove it.  Lieutenant, remove your helmet.  (The guards at the doorway point their guns at Spock's head, so he  takes off the helmet and gives the Major a Look.) [Interrogation room] (Kirk and Spock are being whipped, but they are not  flinching despite the weals and blood on their skin. Green blood in  Spock's case. The man from the street is watching from his cell.)  Enough. do you wish to speak now? Tell me your orders! You were  sent to kill our Fuhrer. Confess! Do you want some more persuasion?  Do not joke with me, Zeon pig. Who is this alien? Things might  go easier if you tell me about him.  You'll be glad to talk to me before I'm through.  Ah, Chairman Eneg. Your Excellency, I am honoured. I've been  interrogating these spies, captured in  Pig! You're speaking to the Chairman of the Party.  Excellency, give me a few minutes with them. I promise you, I'll  have  Yes, Excellency.  Excellency, the standing order is to interrogate and execute.  The interrogation is finished, therefore  Excellency, the order  Yes, Excellency. (Eneg leaves) All right, pigs. I shall keep my  eye on the clock. When the hour is up, you will die most unpleasantly,  I promise you! Lock them up.  (They are put into the cell next to the man from the street.) [Cell]
