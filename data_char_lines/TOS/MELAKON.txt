Hail the Fuhrer!  The Fuhrer has given us our orders, and we pledge him our  lives in this sacred task. Death to Zeon!  Ten minutes ago, on our Fuhrer's orders,  our troops began their historic mission. [Broadcast booth] This is the time of destiny. Hail victory!    What is this?  No, not a Zeon, definitely not.  [Broadcast booth] (Kirk gives Gill another injection.)  Very difficult. Note the sinister eyes and the malformed ears.  Definitely an inferior race.  [Broadcast booth] (Kirk tries slapping Gill to wake him up.)  Note the low forehead, denoting stupidity.  The dull look of a trapped animal. You may take him now for  interrogation, but I want the body saved for the Cultural Museum. He'll  make an interesting display.  (The viewscreen comes alive, and Gill is speaking for himself.)  Go to the booth. See to the Fuhrer at once. He's ill. Turn off  that camera.  I suggest we leave and let our Fuhrer rest.
