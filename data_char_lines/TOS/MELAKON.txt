Hail the Fuhrer!  The Fuhrer has given us our orders, and we pledge him our  lives in this sacred task. Death to Zeon!  But despite our best efforts, they remain like a cancer,  eating away at our state.  Ten minutes ago, on our Fuhrer's orders,  our troops began their historic mission. [Broadcast booth] In the cities, the eliminations have  started. Within an hour, the Zeon blight will forever be removed from  Ekos.  I now announce the glorious final solution.  Our entire solar system will forever be rid of the  disease that was Zeon.  Our space fleet is on its way toward Zeon, both manned  and unmanned weapons. [Main room] This is the time of destiny. Hail victory!    What is this?  No, not a Zeon, definitely not.  [Broadcast booth] (Kirk gives Gill another injection.)  Very difficult. Note the sinister eyes and the malformed ears.  Definitely an inferior race.  [Broadcast booth] (Kirk tries slapping Gill to wake him up.)  Note the low forehead, denoting stupidity.  The dull look of a trapped animal. You may take him now for  interrogation, but I want the body saved for the Cultural Museum. He'll  make an interesting display.  (The viewscreen comes alive, and Gill is speaking for himself.)  Go to the booth. See to the Fuhrer at once. He's ill. Turn off  that camera.  I suggest we leave and let our Fuhrer rest.
