Zeon pig. On your feet, pig.  (They are wearing armbands with - swastikas! on them, Nazi style, not  peaceful indian style. Kirk starts to move.)  Hold. Your hands above your head, Zeon. Higher. Keep your hands  up so you don't touch anything Ekosian. You swine have defiled us for  the last time. But that's now ended. Move!  (They march him away.)
