The bloody thing  he did.  (He turns his head to reveal it's not just an eyepatch, but a covering  over half his face)  Jim, Jim, I need your help. There were only eight or nine of  us who actually saw Kodos. I was one, you were another. If he's to be  exposed,  Then it will be a ghost Martha and I receive in our home  tonight. I invited the entire company to a cocktail party. I have to be  sure.
