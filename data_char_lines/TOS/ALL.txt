Die! Die! Die!  You'll be killed! Kill him! We're all doomed! Die, impostor! You  lied to us! You're not a god! We'll kill you now!  (Spock and McCoy beam down as Miramanee and Kirk fall under the hail of  stones. The crowd runs away when they see them. McCoy checks Kirk  first.) 
Vanilla! Chocolate! Cherry! Banana!  (The kids grab cards and dash to the food dispensers.)  Busy. Busy. Busy! Busy!  (The running around starts again.)  Hail, hail, fire and snow.
