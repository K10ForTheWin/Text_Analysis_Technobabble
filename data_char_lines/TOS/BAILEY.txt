Three days of this now, sir. Other ships must have made star  maps of some of this.  Collision course.  Still collision course. Deflectors aren't stopping it.  Visual contact.  It's blocking the way!  Yes, sir.  The cube's range and position. I'll have it by then. Raising my  voice back there doesn't mean I was scared or couldn't do my job. It  means I happen to have a human thing called an adrenaline gland.  Very funny.  Distance from us, fifteen hundred ninety three metres, position  constant.  Sir, we going to just let it hold us here? We've got phaser  weapons. I vote we blast it.  Bridge to Phaser Gun Crew  I'm sorry, sir. I thought you meant  Yes, sir. We'll try pulling away from it.  Course plotted and laid in, sir.  It's still coming toward us. Range, one hundred ninety metres.  Still coming, gaining on us.  Range one hundred twenty five metres now.  Range fifty one metres and still closing, sir.  Phaser Crew reports ready, sir.  Phasers locked on target, sir. At point-blank range and closing.  Plotted. Laid in, sir.  Warp one, sir.  Yes, sir.  This is the Bridge. Prepare for simulated attack.  On the double, deck five! Give me a green light.  Condition alert. Battle stations. [Kirk's quarters] Engineering, deck five, report. Phaser  crews, come on, let's get with it. Phaser station two, where's your  green light?  This is the Bridge. All decks prepare to better reaction  time on second simulated attack.  Engineering decks alert. Phaser crews, let's  SULU [OC] Countermand that. All decks to battle stations. This is not a  drill. Repeat, this is not a drill.  Bridge to phaser crews, stand ready.  Over five thousand metres away, and it still fills the screen.  A message coming over my navigation beam.  Recorder marker dispatched, sir.  What? A course?  I don't understand this. Spock's wasting time. Everybody else  just sitting around. Somebody's got to do something.  What do they want from us? Let's find out what they want us to  do.  We've only got eight minutes left.  He's doing a countdown!  What, are you all out of your minds? End of watch? It's the end  of everything. What are you, robots? Wound-up toy soldiers? Don't you  know when you're dying? Watch and regulations and orders What do they  mean?  Request permission to return to post, sir.  Captain, he's pulling out a little ahead of  us.  Yes, sir.  We're breaking free, sir.  Course plotted and laid in, sir.  Sir?  Yes, sir.  Testing us?  Me, sir. I'd like to volunteer.  No, sir, I'm not. I'll make plenty of mistakes.
