Some of us are still visiting Doctor Phlox every morning. Actually, I'm stationed outside of Atlanta. No Denobulans, but we have our fair share of alien visitors. You must have gone pretty deep into our records. I haven't lived in Duluth since junior high school. Excuse me? Yes, sir. (Corporal Cole gives a masterclass in using nightstick to disarm and render an assailant helpless.)
Only in simulation, sir. Captain? (scans it) No external injuries. Aye sir.
