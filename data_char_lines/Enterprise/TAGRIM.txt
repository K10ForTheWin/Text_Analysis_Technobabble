We're very relieved to see you. I'm Rellus Tagrim. This is my crew. Considering the circumstances, we would like permission to come aboard as soon as possible. The neutronic wavefront. It's almost here. You should detect the storm in a few minutes. It's travelling at high warp. Once we're aboard, I suggest you go to warp seven immediately. We understand. Our work often takes us far from home. We'd be pleased. They'll be fine, Commander. We're grateful for your hospitality. Guri. I apologise, Commander. We should've spoken with you first. We were in danger. Our ship is less durable than yours. We would've been destroyed by the storm. Captain, I assure you. We don't know these men. Guri. We tried to resign our commissions but they wouldn't allow it. We had no choice. We would've told you the truth, but we weren't sure that you would help us. Captain, I apologise for the difficult position that we've put you in, but I know these men. Even if they found us, I doubt they'd simply leave. They've captured vessels far less impressive than yours. We're not lying. These men are dangerous. [Engineering] I apologise for the trouble we've caused. The Gyrannan System. We should be safe there.
