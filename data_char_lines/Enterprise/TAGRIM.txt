We're very relieved to see you. I'm Rellus Tagrim. This is my crew. Considering the circumstances, we would like permission to come aboard as soon as possible. The neutronic wavefront. It's almost here. You should detect the storm in a few minutes. It's travelling at high warp. Once we're aboard, I suggest you go to warp seven immediately.
