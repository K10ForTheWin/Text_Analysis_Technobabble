It's a little crystal chalice with a figure of a palace. No, the pellet with the poison's in the vessel with a pestle. Not the palace from the chalice! The chalice from the palace! In the vessel with a pestle! The chalice from the palace has the brew that is true! Listen carefully. The pellet with the poison's in the vessel with a pestle, the chalice from the palace has the brew that is true. Just remember that.
