Why haven't you adjusted your time to our capital city? It isn't a requirement. It is simply a courtesy. Something your species doesn't seem to understand. You might also explain to your Captain that it's been nearly three hours since he received our transmission. If he has the slightest hope of acquiring any technology from us, he'd be wise to pay us the courtesy of responding.
