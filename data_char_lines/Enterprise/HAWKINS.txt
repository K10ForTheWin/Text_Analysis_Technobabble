Life support? Stun isn't working. We should set our weapons to kill. With respect ma'am, they don't seem to want our help. Yes, sir. (Back at the docking hatch, two Vulcans are standing guard.) Captain, over here. It's fine, sir. Are you okay? Aye sir. (T'Pol   slides gently down the wall to rest.) Water? No offense, but you look like you could use some. I apologise for the way I reacted before. You were right, this is a rescue mission. May I ask you a question? How is it possible that this crew could turn so violent, when Vulcans aren't supposed to have emotions. Why would they want to kill us? Go ahead, sir. Understood. We're on our way. [Asteroid] (The pair are putting small rocks into a case.) Captain, they're flooding the compartment with hexafluorine. (Outside, Vulcans batter at the door with iron bars.) Captain! (Staring at a big multi-deck hole in their path.) Give me a hand. (Hawkins and Archer pull up the bulkhead keeping them from the docking hatch and use a spare grill to keep it open, while Reed dislodges the girder to leave the Vulcans raging on the other side. Once they are all through, the grill is pushed away and the bulkhead drops again.) [Shuttlepod] We're being hailed. [Shuttlepod two]
Same here, Captain.
I don't want the vessel with the pestle, I want the chalice from the what? The chalice from the palace have the pellet with the poison? Oh, oh, the pestle with the vessel. What about the palace from the chalice? Where's the pellet with the poison? Well then you fight him! Where the pellet with the poison's in the vessel with a pestle, the chalice from the palace has the brew that is true. The pellet with the poison, the pellet with the poison.
Sir. I did six months on the Janus loop. I'm always ready to stretch my legs, sir. Yes, sir. Are we expecting a fire fight? Some kind of hologram? Where is it? [Shuttlepod] Give me a position. I see it. (he climbs a ladder to fire at the mechanical hand device. It grabs him.)
