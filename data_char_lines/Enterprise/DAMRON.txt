We'll be expecting you. (Finally we see the speaker is - a Xindi Reptilian.) [Street, night] (Loomis stops his car near a pair of working girls, and one comes over.) Did you disinfect your hands? We've decided to compensate you for the final three patients in one payment. Bring us the last two blood types and you will be compensated. We can't wait a few more days. We need the last two. Then I suggest you finish your work quickly. We will double your fee for the final three, but the last two must be here by tomorrow. Which one is it? Make certain I do. (Damron closes the door. Loomis takes the wheelchair and leaves.) [In the truck] We won't allow you to destroy us. Your species is doomed. (Damron lunges for the virus, but is shot. Nevertheless, he pushes the virus case and it rolls towards the extractor fan. Archer grabs it before it falls in. T'Pol tags the body.)
