Commander! This thing, it hurts. Just you. Where are we? Slave market? This can't be happening. They're going to come for us, right? The ship? The Captain's going to get us out of here! Pierce. Jeffrey Pierce. I just signed on. I've read every transcript of every mission. I thought I was prepared, that I knew what to expect. Boy, was I wrong. Yeah, I'd like that. I'd like that a lot. (But the big green giant comes in and hauls her away.) Leave her alone!
