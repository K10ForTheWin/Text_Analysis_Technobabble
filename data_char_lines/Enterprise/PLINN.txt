Our salvation. We have another five months ahead of us. If she wakes up there won't be enough food, air to breathe. If we're forced to abort the mission we won't get paid. Please. (He leaves with Tucker.) This regulates power flow to the biopod. These relays are from an old Ardanan shuttle. They weren't designed to carry this much current. By all means. (Tucker wipes some frost off the pod and gazes at the lovely face of an olive-skinned woman with little freckles around the temples.) Is there a problem? Yes? What kind of problem? I'll be there in a moment. I don't mean to be rude. (Plinn dashes out.) (still walking) That's right. (Reed walks alongside with a security man at the rear.) That won't be necessary. Have I done something wrong? I never realised leaving the Captain's table would cause so much concern. (As they approach the docking port, Goss sees Plinn under escort and fires a weapon at the group. The three dive for cover, then Goss dashes back inside his ship and seals his airlock. The freighter's engines power up as Archer and T'Pol arrive.) Obviously, I'm his victim as well. Why else would he leave me here? Goff had the coordinates. It wasn't my responsibility. He was piloting the ship, not me. I spent most of my time looking after the cargo. Believe me, Captain I'm as eager to find my partner as you are. I don't see how. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you with that. I know very little about warp engines. I'm telling you the truth! Why have I been brought here? I already told you everything I know. What about me? Tribunal? (Plinn leaps to his feet.) I am not subject to your laws. How severe? But I haven't done anything wrong. What damage? I had nothing to do with that. What? Seventy two kilograms. One point eight metres. Why are you asking these questions? This is not fair. I demand to speak with someone from my government. You can't allow this. But you're the Captain.
