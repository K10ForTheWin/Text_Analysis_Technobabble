 (a Yridian) I deal in Rigelian flamegems. I was waiting for a prospective buyer when you attacked me. That’s because I jettisoned it all. I thought you where going to arrest me. Flamegems are illegal in this region. Xindi? You’re going to destroy my ship? It’s not you they want. It’s the Denobulan. I was hired to follow him. I don’t know, they work through intermediaries. I was paid to follow the Denobulan if he ever left his home world.
