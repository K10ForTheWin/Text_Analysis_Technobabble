They haven't been duplicated. (Silik threatens Hoshi with a weapon.) What are you doing? Stand up, Vulcan. Up! (He kicks her then hauls her to her feet.)
You have something that belongs to us. We have a salvage claim on the vessel in your launch bay. One of our cell ships discovered it three days ago. We were sent to retrieve it. I'm not interested in the corpse. Decompress your launch bay and release the vessel. The vessel. Now. Drop out of warp and prepare to be boarded. The Vulcans won't risk their ship for an Earth vessel. (Ends transmission and fires at Enterprise)
