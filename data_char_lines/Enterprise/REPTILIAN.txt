You're being naive. Their planet is fifty light years away. It is not a coincidence. How many humans are aboard? You will accomplish nothing if all you do is run tests. They scanned the debris and left nearly three hours ago. Toward the Orassin distortion fields.
We couldn't pursue the bio-weapon because we didn't have enough information about the humans. Now we do.
I'll contact Gralik. If the test is successful, how long before we can deploy the weapon? More delays? That's no excuse. They should have been ready by now. Such lethargic creatures. In a complex this size, how difficult can it be? Walks? We don't have time for you to go foraging through the forest. We'll find him ourselves.  [Forest] (Reed's scanner beeps.) Where were you? And do your personal activities involve destroying one of our seekers? Who was with you? Our scans detected other biosigns. What kind of tests? We were told the shipment was ready. We should go, Degra. We're behind schedule already. (Gralik is the only one with a view of the shuttle, and Archer leaving it.) And you've been well paid for it. It doesn't concern you.
(to other Reptilian) Fifteen millilitres from the new arrival. (Somehow Archer doesn't flinch as the needle is pushed into his neck and the blood sample drawn.) [Loomis' car]
That can be remedied. I'll contact Gralik. Typical humanoid arrogance. You expect us to come scurrying whenever it suits you. Then why are you wasting our time? When? Not enough. Every failure puts us at risk. We hope so. [Command centre] (Watching a playback of the test.)
I want four ships to accompany the weapon. Restrain him.
You had no right to recall my ships.
Where is Degra? With the humans? I supposed the Council authorised these negotiations? Undock from the human vessel immediately.  [Bridge] Proceed to our starboard docking port. You'll all be dealt with as the Council sees fit.  [Bridge]
