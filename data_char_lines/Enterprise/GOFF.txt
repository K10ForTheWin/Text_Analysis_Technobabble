Gracious of you to help us, Captain. We were beginning to think our distress call would never be answered. We were hired to return a young woman to her home world. A few days ago her stasis pod began to malfunction. No, no. She's a passenger, but our ship is designed to haul cargo, not people and it's a very long journey. Putting her in suspended animation was our only choice. You've been very accommodating. If it's not too much trouble I'd like to make another request. It's been a long time since we've enjoyed the luxury of a bath. I hope I didn't deplete your water supply. Warp two point two. That's a generous offer, but I've already inconvenienced you far too much. I'm sure you'll do fine on your own. It's not that simple, Captain. This has all been carefully prearranged. Her family's not expecting her for another five months. They're not even on her home world at the moment. But I will accept your offer of a meal, if it's not too late. [Retellian cargo bay] The stasis pod. It's malfunctioning. If you'll excuse me, Captain. (He gets up.) I know the way. [Retellian cargo bay] (The woman is shouting and thumping at the pod lid as Trip tries to crowbar it open. Goff grabs his arm.) What are you doing? We can't bring her out of stasis.
