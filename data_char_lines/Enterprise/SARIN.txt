My name is Sarin. Tell me about the people who took Klaang off your ship. Where were you taking him? Would you prefer I did? So you could take him where? If you're thinking about harming me, I'd advise against it. Why were you taking Klaang home? I've been given the ability to measure trust, but it requires close contact. I'm a member of the Cabal, but not any longer. The price of evolution was too high. Some of my people are so anxious to improve themselves that they've lost perspective. Klaang was carrying a message to his people. I gave it to him. The Suliban have been staging attacks within the Klingon Empire, making it appear that one faction is attacking another. Klaang was bringing proof of this to his High Council. Without that proof, the Empire could be thrown into chaos. The Cabal doesn't make decisions on its own. They're simply soldiers fighting a Temporal Cold War. They're taking orders from the distant future. We can help you find Klaang but we don't have a starship. You'll have to take us with you. (Weapons fire. They head for cover and return This way. (As they head onto an elevator platform, Silik shoots Sarin in the back) Find Klaang. (Sarin dies) [Rooftop]
