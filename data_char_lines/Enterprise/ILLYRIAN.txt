Thank you for coming, but be aware. This region contains dangerous spatial distortions. They've damaged our engines and life support. We would appreciate whatever assistance you can give us. (humanoid) Curiosity. We're studying the red giant. It's the first one we've had the opportunity to explore. We weren't prepared for these spatial anomalies as you call them. Seems you weren't either. Combat? No. We're new to this region of space. I've heard of it. It's extremely rare. Perhaps we can work out some sort of trade. Given the condition of my vessel, I don't know what we can offer you. We could probably spare a few plasma injectors, maybe some antimatter. I'm afraid that's one thing we can't spare. Without a warp coil, the journey back to our system would take three years. We're not equipped for a voyage of that length. I sympathise, Captain. I will help you in any other way, but I won't jeopardize the lives of my crew. I'm sorry. (The Illyrian ship flies off.) (T'Pol dreams that she and Tucker are kissing passionately in the shower, when she turns into a Zombie Vulcan from 'Impulse' and attacks him. She wakes up distressed, gets an environment suit and heads off through the vacuum of E deck to a very wrecked Cargo Bay two. She falls trying to get to the lower level and her air supply disconnects. Panicking, she manages to reconnect it and then goes to the trellium-D storage box. She removes some rocks from a canister near the bottom. In the lab, she turns the rock into liquid and injects herself with it.) [Shuttle bay] Run another test. If it doesn't hold, we'll have to bypass the entire assembly. (comm. beeps) What is it? Have you contacted them? What you can't have, you take by force? You're stranding us three years from home. Why are you doing this?
