On the Eastern perimeter. On your feet. (Reed and Archer have their hands tied behind their backs, and they are marched out at gunpoint.)  [Cell ship] (There's a beep and a shudder. Travis is flying the thing.)
Their engines are down. Life support failing. Two biosigns, human. Move! Walk, human! (The pair take on the Klingons, easily throwing them along the corridor, and knocking them out.) [Klingon Bridge]
And our avian brothers would still fill the skies. Degra's vessel is less than twenty minutes behind us. No vessels, but there is one small orbital station. Unarmed. (They emerge into normal space.) Eight primates, three arboreals and seven humans. No, sir. They're not human. Commander, sensors show the humans are no longer aboard Degra's vessel.
A vortex is opening. Bearing two seven nine, range four thousand kilometres. Were you expecting reinforcements? Arboreals. More vortexes are opening. Fourteen, eighteen ships. Aquatics. Six ships approaching the weapon. Sir. The humans. [Bridge] We can't, sir. The Aquatics are protecting them. [Bridge] We've lost eight vessels. We've only disabled two of theirs. We're no match for the Aquatics. The intruders are trapped on level seven. They've disabled three of the Aquatic ships. The Insectoids. Sir?
Yes, sir. (They leave.) The Sector Two Report, sir. They're probably trying to reach the Vulcans.
We've located debris. It's from the ship we sent to find Degra. Seven light years from here, within the cloaking barrier of a Sphere. It's underway. Preliminary findings suggest they were attacked.
