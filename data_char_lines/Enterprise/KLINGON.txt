There are thirty six aboard. What kind of technology?
OonoS Thrott! Nej joS mIch ka Xanant 'ach pagh Q'tahL Class planet. We destroyed their ship, but we've sustained damage in our port fusion injector. We've descended into the outer atmosphere of a Q'tahL Class planet to make repairs in case there are other Xarantine ships in the area. My crew is falling ill and I have been unable to determine why. If we had died when the Xarantine attacked our honour would be secure, but to fall victim to some disease, to be crushed into nothing in the depths of this miserable planet.
We're attempting to transfer you. Stand by. 
Who is this? You've entered restricted space. Drop out of warp and prepare for inspection. No ship is allowed to pass through this system without authorisation, on the orders of Governor Klag. What sort of business? I'm not detecting a Council transponder signal. Perhaps you forgot to activate it. Chancellor M'Rek is on your ship? The Orions. (laughs) I've heard rumours of his negotiations with their females. Tell me, is it true what they say about them? I meant no insult. Understood. We're honoured to have the Chancellor in our system. Qapla'. Earth vessel, surrender and prepare to be boarded! (Enterprise comes under attack.)
What do you want with me? I demand to see the magistrate. (His captors set up a blood transfusion - it's green - and stick the needle into his arm.) My death sentence was commuted! (His breathing becomes laboured, then he cries out in pain as his forehead ridges ripple.) Captain's Starlog, November 27, 2154. We've returned home for the official launch of our sister ship, Columbia. On a personal note, I'll also be saying goodbye to one hell of a chief Engineer. [Trip's quarters] (Tucker takes a break from packing to gaze at Columbia in Spacedock, when the doorbell rings.)
