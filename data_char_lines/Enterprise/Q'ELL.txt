I didn't touch anything. I just like to look inside the ships that come here. You might have said no. Well, it's a little small and your thruster controls are hard to reach. How fast can it go? You're a pilot? Q'ell. Could you teach me how to fly it? I can drive the crawler that we use to move our drill rigs. Really? [Settlement] (In a tent, Tessic, Maklii - sans headband - and a woman are bartering with Archer and T'Pol.) I once saw a Kellenite ship with cannons and torpedoes. Like Enterprise. You could have fought the Klingons. Beaten them. Why didn't you try? Lieutenant Reed said I'd have to hide in the canyons when the Klingons come back. But I want to help. I can shoot a shib'a lizard from forty metres. I don't want to hide. Yes, sir.Â (In the Armoury, the trainee gunmen are turning into marksmen. By morning, the wells are capped off and concealed under rock and rubble.) [Inside a module] I wish you didn't have to leave. Thanks. Do you think you'll come back?
