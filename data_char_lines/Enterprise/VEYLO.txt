A human tradition? So cheese comes in eight varieties? What made you choose these? Mild, but very nice. The odour is a little spicier. What's it called? Haven't you ever tried it? Here. (Reed recoils fromÂ the Stilton under his nose.) And what's this called? Interesting. (Veylo sniffs it then offers it to Reed.) VEYLO: Don't you find it sensual? Can we visit the Armoury later? I'm anxious to see your tactical array.  Are these armed with photonic warheads? I'm afraid our weapons are somewhat more sophisticated than yours. Where I come from, antiquated can be very quaint. And charming. What sort of power source do these use? (The phase pistols and rifles.) Not at all. We charge our weapons the same way. Please. (Reed unlocks and removes the hatch.) Impressive. Don't be. I've wanted to get a little closer to you all day. I was hoping to spend some intimate time with you. Maybe we could sleep together tonight. (Reed stands up suddenly and hits his head on a pipe.) It's very different on Vissia. It's only when a woman enjoys her intimate time with a man that she'll join him for dinner.
