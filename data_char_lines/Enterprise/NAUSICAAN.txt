(sitting behind Tucker) If you don't like it, give it to me. Give it to me. You don't listen too well. How much did they pay you to let them go? I'm innocent, too. I'll pay you. We're all innocent! How much?! (In the distraction, the man in front of Archer releases his restraints.) He's alive. He tried to get a weapon. The next person who speaks goes out the airlock. He needs to concentrate. (Tucker has been released and is working on something in a bulkhead.)  [Prison transport Bridge] Thanks. You haven't eaten for two days. Don't be a fool. Where you going? You're the engineer.
You're not very skilled at interrogation. I could give you some lessons. You know my shipmates will come for me. I told you they'd come for me.
