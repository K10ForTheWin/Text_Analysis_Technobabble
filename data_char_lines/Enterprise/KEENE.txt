Hauled down in the corner of the end zone. Touchdown! I doubt you could throw the ball ten metres on Earth. Did you find out what was causing that vibration in module two? Keep an eye on it. (There's a judder.) Drop out of warp. Charge the plasma cannon. (Another hit and we see the alien ship strafing the cargo hauler.) [Archer's quarters] Just a little stiff. Thank your doctor for me. I've got some Drilaxian whisky stashed away, if you'd like to join me. Too bad. If you've never had it, you're missing one of the galaxy's real pleasures. I'm reducing Mister Ryan's rank to Able Crewman. He gets to spend the rest of the trip purging hydraulic pumps. No, we take care of our own. Besides, that would leave me a man short. I made him my first officer because I trusted him with my ship. It's going to take him quite a while to earn that back. The ones that grew up out here feel they have some special claim, that this particular stretch of space is theirs. They see another ship within ten light years, they get jumpy. The ships get faster. It's progress, I suppose. My family's been on the Fortunate for three generations. Now, I'm going to need at least a warp three engine to stay in business. Going it alone's all I've ever done, and for some of us it's the reason we're out here. A chance to prove ourselves. Well, we'll adapt, we always have, but things just won't be the same. (They shake hands.) Sure you won't join me for that drink?
