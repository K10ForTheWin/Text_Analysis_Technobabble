This is Captain Tellus of Vulcan Survey vessel D'Vahl. I'm responding to your distress signal. Your signal was picked up by a Tellarite freighter. It took them some time to forward it to the High Command. We're approaching the system now. Meet us at the crash site in three days. Where is your captain? There were four Vulcans aboard your vessel.
