(not in a military uniform) Your ship is adrift in enemy space, damaged and defenceless, because of a single Rigelian scoutship? Is that what you want me to report to the Senate? If our enemies find it. This prototype's a modified warbird. The Vulcans would identify it the moment they inspected the propulsion matrix. Don't underestimate our distant brothers. Bring your ship home. I'll tell the Senate that your test has been a success. Otherwise, they'll make someone pay for this failure. (He opens the door and we see two Remans waiting for the Senator.) And I promise you, it won't be me. Jolan tru, Admiral. [Ready room] You allowed our enemies to board and disable the Drone. I have my sources, Admiral. I'm here to witness its destruction. [Bridge] The Drone will escape. (It certainly manages to dodge two torpedoes, thanks to not bothering about inertial stabilisers.) [Romulan ship]
This mission was supposed to cause dissension in the region. It's had the opposite effect. The Andorians and Tellarites have formed an alliance. They're working together for the first time in history. The group of senators doesn't share your optimism. They're presenting a motion to cancel this mission. The mistake was mine when I supported this endeavour. Do you realise how you've weakened my position? After a failure of this magnitude, I could be dead. We're both under arrest.
