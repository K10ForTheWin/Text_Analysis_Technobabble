They're still not responding. Should I arm the plasma turrets? Yes, sir. Warp one point six, one point seven, warp one point eight (The old tub is shaking a lot.) One point eight five. (The ships fire three more shots at the Horizon, then something that lands on the hull and starts blinking.) They're moving off. It's emitting a subspace signal. Could be some kind of beacon. The Constellation sent us this. This ship attacked them eight weeks ago and it planted a beacon on their hull. A day later, this cruiser showed up and demanded their cargo. The Constellation tried to drive them off, but the aliens got aboard and killed three of their crew. Then they took the entire shipment. Two plasma turrets, same as us. Module five. We're being hailed. They've hit Module five. Their weapons are going down.
