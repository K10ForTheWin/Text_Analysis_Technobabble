(a younger girl) I didn't mean to disturb you. I've never met a blueskin. Don't ask me to explain. I was never very good at science. SHRAN; Neither was I. Is it true that where you come from, the temperature rises above freezing for weeks at a time? I can't imagine such a place. I came here to apologise. When I saw you for the first time, I sensed some of your thoughts. I didn't intend to. I know what it's like to lose someone. Gareb, the one who's missing, he's my brother. He would never hurt anyone, not intentionally. Do you think he's in pain? I have nightmares. Gareb's bound, locked in a strange cage. He's calling for me. He wants me to rescue him. [Control area] (Gareb is lead back in and put into the pilot's chair.) You need to rest. Wait A swarm. It'll take a few minutes for them to pass. Gareb and I loved chasing ice-bores. Once, we followed a swarm for two hours, caught hundreds of them. We were almost at the surface. My family was very worried. They're going to be worried about me now. I won't abandon my brother. What's it like, your ship? He's right, we're going in circles. They're trying to stop us. They're not letting us see the path to the surface. SHRAN; How could that be possible? (An image of Lissan flickers on the path in front of them.) I can't. LISSAN; They're fighting a war. Do you want to be a part of that? I don't want to fight anyone. I want to help my brother. LISSAN; Help him by standing up for what we believe in. Take my thoughts. LISSAN; You're certain this is what you want? Yes. I'm ready, Captain. (The helmet is lowered over her head. Tucker reads the monitor.) It's strangely enjoyable. Is that good? Is there another test we can try? What happened? I was dreaming about Gareb. I failed, didn't I? Talas was a fortunate woman. My brother is going to die, isn't he? It's hard to be strong. What's happening? Wait. I can feel him. (She gets up.) PHLOX; Where do you think you're going? Connect me to the device, I need to try again. PHLOX; I can't allow it. You barely survived the last attempt. I can reach him. I can make him stop. I can do it. No! It's me. You have to stop what you're doing. I'm on the ship you're attacking. [Control area] They lied to you. It wasn't you. It was them, they forced you. You can stop it. You know what you have to do. [Control area] Gareb! (As one Drone blows the other to pieces, Valdore kills Gareb. Shran and Phlox get Jhamel out of the telepresence device and Reed blows up the other Drone. Shran comforts Jhamel.) [Transporter alcove] I owe you a thanks. If I hadn't come with you, my brother would have died alone. Goodbye, Captain.
