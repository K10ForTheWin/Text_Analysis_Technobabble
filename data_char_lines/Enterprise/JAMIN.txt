Human? What's that? You tracked from Earth on a sky ship. To what, gut the rest of us? We're not so easy to hunt as diggers. Go back to the overside or we'll seal your passage. Take that one, and don't track back. Humans hurt Novans. They gutted us. Our families, our before-families. No. How long of a day would it take? Hours? We track together. This one stays. Open the passage. Open it. Is she healed? Injections? It's human shale. They're confusing your path. You'll lose your tracks in this. All I see is digger filth. Bury your drawings. (Archer clears monitor.) We are not leaving. Giant rocks falling from the sky. Shale, it's all shale! Take us back. It's the medicine they put in you. They're confusing your path. We need to leave. Shale! They're trying to trap you. They're trying to make us leave the underside. If we're not back before day, your crewman will be gutted. Take us back. If our tunnels are infected you wouldn't want them so badly. When we track back to the underside, we'll return your crewman only if you promise to leave. Open it. Open it. Open it! We're in the downslope passage. We need to pass the cut-through to get to your crewman. Give me your pistol. If you want to see your human alive, you'll give me your pistol. (Archer hands it over. Jamin and Nadet lead the way.) He must have fallen when your sky ship quaked the tunnels. Are you hurt? Would you risk your bones to save a Novan? We'll track together, but you'll need to trust me. (Jamin leads the way, but Archer slips and is dangling from one hand until Jamin hauls him back to safety. They make it to the bottom.) The water's rising. We have to hurry. (They heave at the log, but they can't move it.) Why, so you can go free your hostage? They promised to leave. Let them go. We'll be fine here. They've promised to leave.
