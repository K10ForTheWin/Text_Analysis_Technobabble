You're not being realistic.  You've made this promise before.  Even if you get the money, which I doubt, it  wouldn't change my decision.  What are you doing here?  You shouldn't have brought him.  And I suppose you have no way of paying for it.  If I give you the injector, you have to promise never to come  back here.  That was years ago. I work here now.  It's better than hunting criminals.  I have work to do.  You won't want that ship after you see it.  The Klingons cannibalised her. Every power relay, every  conduit.  They're gone. I'll give you the injector, but after that I  want you to leave. (Gaavrin leaves.)
