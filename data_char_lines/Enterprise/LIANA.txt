Don't touch that. The power's been routed to our living area through that relay. It's very dangerous. You're welcome. My father's the engineer. He taught me how things work. Am I interrupting? I thought you might like something to eat. Are you hungry? It's called lorella. We grow it in the airponics bay. Nothing'll take root outside. I didn't mean to be rude. Do you know a lot of women? What about on, what did you call your planet? What about it? Why can't I go? What's wrong with seeing their ship, meeting some of their crew? These are good people. They want to help us. I promise not to say anything. [Situation room] How many people are on Enterprise? All humans? Can I meet him? Dog? (They get into a lift. It's a small space for two so they're almost touching and she's beaming.) What does he do? Of course, his pet. I've never seen a dog before. Can we see it? (They get out of the lift) I don't know. It sounds like I'm going to be very busy. Oh, it's boring. I want to hear about the places you've been. Where are you going next? Which planet was your favourite? There are different kinds? That sounds terrible. Why do they call it that? Marshmallows? Very much. I think Sickbay was my favourite. Doctor Phlox let me feed his bat. He also asked me to lunch. Had I known you were going to be gone so long. What's wrong? Captain Kuulan told you. Why? Well, your scans must be wrong. I think I should go now. Take me back. I can't. I'm sorry, but I can't. Please take me home. [Alien ship] (T'Pol is exploring an uninhabited and damaged part of the ship when suddenly she meet a young man in a blue and red top, and very much alive).) You don't have to do this. You're not in any danger here. Can't you just fix our systems and go? This is my home. I didn't tell them anything. Please, just let them leave. That's what you wanted in the first place. (to Ezral) Make him stop. He'll listen to you. He still should have told them the truth. He can do whatever he wants. He's not like you. You think this is my fault? No, I didn't. (to Shilat, as she enters) Would you wait outside? It's all right. (Shilat leaves, Liana shuts the door.) LIANA: They do what I ask them to. I wish I could. Do you think it's possible to tell a lie so many times that you begin to believe it's the truth? You can. I never really understood that until you came. Remember when you said you thought we were ghosts? In a way, you were right. [Alien ship] (The rescue team have made it onboard and are moving along by flashlight.) Yes. (They hear weapons fire.) They're the only people I've ever known, besides my father, until you've came. That isn't true. They died because of me. Trip, please. Good. We're about to start realigning the antimatter injectors. What's that? Rocky Road? Thank you. You've got a lot more places to go. I'd like that. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.
