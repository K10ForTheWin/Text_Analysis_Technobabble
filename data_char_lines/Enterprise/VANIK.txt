I'm Captain Vanik. You're a long way from Earth, Captain. Are you lost? Our sensors detected it two days ago. We also decided to investigate. Actually, it's your interest in the comet that we're investigating. If you have no objection, we'd like to remain here and observe. You're not mistaken. Six point five. Our warp systems are classified. Not personally. You're easily impressed. No. I've already eaten. Perhaps another time. I only drink water. I hope our presence here is not proving inconvenient. Excuse me? I've noticed. What would you like to know? I've served in the Vulcan space programme for seventy six years, fifteen of them commanding the Ti'Mur. I have none. Humans have never held much interest for me. If we were spying, Captain, you would have never detected our presence. Your inexperience and your arrogance are your enemies, not us. Archer (opens the door, and a security officer enters.) Shanshot tumora camosh. (He leaves.) This is Captain Vanik of the Vulcan ship Ti'Mur. Stand by to ignite your engines and return to your ship. [Bridge] As your science officer told you, we have little interest in comets. That information is classified. We'll be leaving within the hour. Is there anything else we can help you with?
