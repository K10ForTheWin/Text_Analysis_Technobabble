There's more intolerance today than there was a thousand years ago. It has to stop. If I despised you, I'd be despising myself. I'm part of the minority. (They sit on a bench.) As far as my colleagues are concerned, you might as well be. Anyone who chooses to perform a mind-meld is worthy of contempt. You were coerced. You should tell them. They'll be far more sympathetic.

The mind-meld was performed against her will. She told me herself. She made me promise to stay silent. I'm sorry. I had to tell them the truth. You should do the same.
