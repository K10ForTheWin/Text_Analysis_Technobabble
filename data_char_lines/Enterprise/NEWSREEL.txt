News On Parade! America and Germany together in the fight for freedom. In his first visit to the home of the Brave, the German chancellor received a warm welcome from the Big Apple! He greeted enthusiastic crowds in Times Square and took in the view from the top of the Empire State Building. Watch that first step! Later, the Fuhrer paid a call to Lady Liberty, where he was given the keys to the city! The whirlwind tour was capped off by a four-hour speech to city leaders, where the Fuhrer outlined his vision for a prosperous alliance between Germany and America. Vowing to root out the parasitic elements that have crippled our economy since 1929 and to liberate the masses from the grip of financial profiteers, Together, we will put Americans back to work. Two great nations marching side by side toward a bold future! (The Nazi flag is above the US one on the flagpole.) [Nazi HQ - Vosk's office]
