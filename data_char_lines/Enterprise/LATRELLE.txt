When we were training in San Francisco there was a little restaurant on the Embarcadero he liked to go to. They had a specialty, some kind of fish, I think. No. I had sea bass. I don't remember. Maureen. No, she was the waitress. That's why Malcolm wanted to go there. He had a thing for her. I think he hates fish.
