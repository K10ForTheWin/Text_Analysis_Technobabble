Kora noosa. Kora noosa! Uch. Cucht eeta ekrajhn-voy? NanDi. Vanee eday. (They come alongside Enterprise and dock.) [Corridor] (They enter by the starboard airlock wearing gasmasks, and we see the crew slumped against the bulkheads, unconscious.) Klaxut. Rejahvey. [Decon chamber] (Tucker wakes up. He is wearingÂ blue singlet and shorts.) Ingala habi. (Grish injects Archer and he wakes up, handcuffed to a stanchion.) Ingala duk habi? (Krem cautiously holds out a translator while Muk has a rifle.) Duk habi nakustra? Bok, megoron duk what I'm saying? Who we are is unimportant. Do you command this ship? They're sleeping. They won't be harmed as long as you cooperate. Where is the location of your vault? He understands. You carry no valuables of any kind? No precious gems, no latinum? What do we have? Scanners, low-grade weapons. (Archer spots Tucker You're right, Krem. Pick out the females that will bring the best price. It was a pleasure doing business with you. You've reconsidered? Gold-pressed latinum? Ten percent. Fifteen. Twenty percent. Final offer. No. We'll find the vault ourselves. Krem, start loading the merchandise. Make him do it. (Muk gives Krem the rifle and the other three leave.) [Alien cargo bay] (Compared with the Launch bay, it's tiny. Krem has Archer lugging boxes. His overalls are tied around his waist.) Rule of Acquisition number twenty three. Nothing is more important than your health, except for your money. Hold on. (He touches the right bit of the monitor screen and the door opens, then the gurney extends out,) We'll find it, Muk. Be patient. Open those. [unidentifiable place] (T'Pol watches their activities.) Gold? Add it to the pot. We agreed to split our profits. We had a deal. Fine. I'll just deduct it from your share of the gold.(Trip attaches a security lock to the Biomatter resequencing section door) [Situation room] What's all this? If you're not going to help us you should return to the ship. And what are you doing? They're not going to put it on a map, you idiot. So? What's the quickest route? It's worth a look. (T'Pol taps her PADD.) [Situation room] (An ear-bleeding noise makes the aliens cringe) Weapons! Where is it coming from? Let's get to their Captain's quarters. (Muk returns to the situation room.) You should be more careful with your acquisitions. No. Are you calling me a thief? Why would I bother taking some worthless scanners? (T'Pol touches her PADD.) [Situation room] (A beeping sound emanates from Ulis's bag. Muk grabs it and finds his scanners.) I didn't put them there. I tell you, I don't know. There's nothing here. Let's search the other quarters. Why aren't you asleep? (He whips him again.) [Launch bay] Who's this? Why is he awake? Are there others? Not without the gold. If you want to leave, take one of their shuttlecraft. I'll be happy to keep your share. You can keep the shuttlecraft, and the females. It'll have to be. Get out. Wife? Enough! I accept your offer. You have my word as a businessman. Wait here. I'll go. We'll count it later. We can't all go. Time's running out. Someone has to stay and finish loading the ship. Krem. Get back to work! Where are we going? After you. [Alien cargo hold] Haven't we been through this section? I recognise that conduit. How much further? Is this some kind of trick? [Biomatter recycling] Open it. Open it! (Tucker opens the hatch slightly.) Why? I'll go. Take your hands off me! Get away from that hatch! Out of my way! It's mine! It's a trap! (T'Pol stuns them with a phase pistol) Release me, and I'll forget this ever happened. Let me go, you idiot! I'll let you have my latinum pen. The one you've always had your eye on. My beetle-snuff collection. (Krem settles into the Captain's chair.) Name your price. Krem! We're family.
