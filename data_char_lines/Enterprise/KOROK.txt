My old friend. My crew's hungry. Let's have food and drink. Then we'll discuss business. I sense what you're about to say is not going to make me happy. You've had enough time. We'll take all of it, now. They all appear to be working. You're lying! (He knocks Tessic down.) I can get deuterium anywhere. I come here because I like you, when you show me hospitality and respect. I'll give you four days. Have it all ready. (into communicator) HIjol! (The Klingons are beamed away and the rest run out to help.) Listen. The pumps. They're silent. (raises his voice) Where's your hospitality? This is no way to treat your friends. Show yourselves! (He gives orders in Klingon and his men start to search the modules.Â Maklii makes a bird call, and another man shows himself then runs off. The Klingons follow and the first one gets knocked down by a wire suddenly pulled taut. Then the shooting starts and they take cover. The Starfleet crew have dressed like the colonists, including bandanas to conceal their lack of forehead markings.) This will cost you more than deuterium! (A woman with excellent aim hits a Klingon with a rock.) What are you doing? You'll kill us all. Those wellheads, they're under great pressure. If you ignite them you'll incinerate the entire town. (Maklii runs away) They're hiding in the dirt like Targ. They'll learn to show us respect. We'll kill another four. Perhaps the boy as well. (As the Klingons march towards the gullies where the fighters are concealed) This shouldn't be here. P'taQ. You'll live to regret this. We can find deuterium anywhere. Yours isn't fit for a garbage scow. (He speaks into his communicator and the party is beamed away. The colonists rejoice at their victory.) [Shuttlepod]
