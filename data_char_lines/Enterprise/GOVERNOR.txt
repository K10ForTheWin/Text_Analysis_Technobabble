Captain Archer, I thought I made myself clear. What do you mean? I assure you, they're not targeting your crewmen or the Denobulans. Soldiers from the previous regime. They've refused to accept the shift in power. I'm afraid that's impossible. We agreed to give you three days, nothing more. If you attack us, we'll retaliate. Do you really want to be at war with us, Captain?
