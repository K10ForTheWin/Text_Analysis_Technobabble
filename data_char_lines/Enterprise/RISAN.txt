It'd be a shame to deprive any of your people. If you add a few days to your stay, you could give everyone a chance to enjoy themselves. The additional charge would be minimal. Don't be so sure. After two days and nights on Risa you may never want to leave. I see your crew has chosen a wide variety of locales and activities that should keep them very entertained, but I see you won't be joining us, Sub-Commander. Well, I'm sorry. As I'm sure you remember, we have many diversions designed for our Vulcan guests. The package is all-inclusive. Trust me, Mister Tucker. (takes dilithium container) No one will go away disappointed.
