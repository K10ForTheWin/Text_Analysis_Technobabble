(seeing Phlox looking around) We can go if you're bored. You won't be disappointed. The ending's classic. They don't have movies where you come from, do they? Still, it's nice to take a break from real life every now and then, don't you think? Temporal vein. Internal maxillary. Posterior auricular? Oh, er, superior vena cava. Oh, easy. The seat of all joy and sadness. You know, you may know about our cardiopulmonary system, but you have a lot to learn about the human heart. (gestures to door) This is me. Oh, Doctor. I just wanted to thank you. It was fun tonight. Er, they're showing another one next week. Sunset Boulevard. I think you might like it. See you tomorrow? Oh, sorry. I forgot Denobulans don't like to be touched. Oh, in that case. (She gives him a kiss on the cheek.) CUTLER: Good night. (Cutler goes into her quarters, Phlox walks on.) Thank you, Doctor. What'd you say? Thank you. Did he just say food? Tik tik. Well, that's the last one. What'd he do? It seems like a vacation, if I didn't keep remembering why we were here. This really doesn't bother you. The way the Valakians treat them. They force the Menk to live in compounds. They treat them almost like pets. Doesn't make it right. Of course not. I would have told you. You are? So, you have two ex-wives? Is that considered normal for Denobulans? Why are you telling me this? Oh. You didn't. But I still don't know why you're telling me this. That doesn't matter. Phlox, as far as your extended family goes I'm not interested in becoming wife number four. I just want to be your friend. Let's just see where it goes. [Valakian hospital ward]
It's healthier than that. I guess it just takes a more discriminating palate to appreciate Vulcan cuisine. Do you know there are over five thousand subspecies of termites on Loracus Prime? (A glow comes in through the window, every one gets up and looks at a beautiful blue planet.) Anybody hear about this? I wonder if somebody lives there? What do you think, first contact? Is that snow on those mountains? Well, call him. [Bridge] I tried some plomeek broth this morning. It was very good. Vulcan food is interesting. Yes. Thanks for choosing me for this mission. (sotto) Great. I know. [Shuttlepod] (En route to the planet surface.) Worth every light year. I assume the Captain went after him. (pointing up) That's it, to the left of that trinary cluster. Our sun. Yeah, positive. Just another speck of light no different than any other. Are you okay? Wait a minute. You notice something? Fireflies are gone. Maybe it's the ghost of George Webb. (A gust of wind suddenly blows through the camp.) What? It's the wind. [Tent one] Nope. What? Three? What did they look like? Ethan? (Ethan is very tense and swinging his torch around.) Where are you going? Who were they? Well, who were you talking to? She's lying, Commander. I saw her talking to them. In there. There were two of them. No, I'm not. Why won't you tell us what's going on? What do they want? [Shuttlepod] Never better. It could be a trap, Commander. What?
I've adjusted the dosage to wake you up in exactly forty eight hours. I know where the bandages are.  He's not available. He's sleeping. Just a couple of days. Don't worry. I can handle a broken leg. Did they give you any medication? Oh, it's probably nothing. Let's get you to Sickbay. [Club Cellar] (Daylight streams in through a skylight onto our boys, now stripped down to their regulation blue skivvies, and tied hand and foot.) You're having a reaction to the painkiller they gave you. If the swelling gets any worse, it could begin to constrict his airway. I'm not so sure this is a good idea. Yeah, that's what I'm worried about. (She injects Phlox.) Phlox? He's in Sickbay. He's having some kind of anaphylactic reaction. Doctor. Er, which container are they in? Let's go, Doctor. How do you feel?
