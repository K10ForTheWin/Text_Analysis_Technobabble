It's healthier than that. I guess it just takes a more discriminating palate to appreciate Vulcan cuisine. Do you know there are over five thousand subspecies of termites on Loracus Prime? (A glow comes in through the window, every one gets up and looks at a beautiful blue planet.) Anybody hear about this? I wonder if somebody lives there? What do you think, first contact? Is that snow on those mountains? Well, call him. [Bridge] I tried some plomeek broth this morning. It was very good. Vulcan food is interesting. Yes. Thanks for choosing me for this mission. (sotto) Great. I know. [Shuttlepod] (En route to the planet surface.) Worth every light year. I assume the Captain went after him. (pointing up) That's it, to the left of that trinary cluster. Our sun. Yeah, positive. Just another speck of light no different than any other. Are you okay? Wait a minute. You notice something? Fireflies are gone. Maybe it's the ghost of George Webb. (A gust of wind suddenly blows through the camp.) What? It's the wind. [Tent one] Nope. What? Three? What did they look like? Ethan? (Ethan is very tense and swinging his torch around.) Where are you going? Who were they? Well, who were you talking to? She's lying, Commander. I saw her talking to them. In there. There were two of them. No, I'm not. Why won't you tell us what's going on? What do they want? [Shuttlepod] Never better. It could be a trap, Commander. What?
So what are the Menk like?
I'm not so sure this is a good idea.
