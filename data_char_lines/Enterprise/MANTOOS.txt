I'm Prah Mantoos. May Agosoria embrace you into his cycle of renewal. These are my fellow celebrants. We've travelled many light years from different worlds to watch this event. For you, Captain. (Mantoos hands over glass circle with etchings, in a stand.) A clock. It charts time from the beginning of the universe. (With points around the chin and eyebrows.) That will be more than enough. Normally we fast during the Time of Agosoria, but in this case I suppose we can break with tradition. You've travelled a great distance in a short period of time. I'm pleased you appreciate its beauty, Captain. To us, it's more than just a simple stellar nursery. According to our sacred text this is where the universe began. It represents the continuing cycle of creation. Many who see the Great Plume are often inspired by it. Perhaps you will be, too. [Bridge] They're very common in this region. I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. [Bridge] We're used to it. I'm just grateful there was no serious damage. I'll let them know. It's beginning. Well, that's hard to predict. Every cycle is unique. Would you care to recite the Invocation of Renewal with us? Yoraya.
