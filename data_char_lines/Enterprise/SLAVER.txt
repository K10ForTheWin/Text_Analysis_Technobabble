You are now the property of the Orion Syndicate. Break the rules, and you will suffer. Follow the rules, and you will suffer less. Take her. (She is thrown into one of a number of cages filled with people of assorted races. There is a young man in a Starfleet uniform cowering in the corner.) You're doing well. (When the bidding ends, he rejoices.) SLAVER: Three million six! Not even my last wife sold for that much. (By the slave cages, Archer and Soong are scanning for human biosigns.) If you don't sell as a slave, I will sell you as food. (But there's not a lot of interest, and there aren't many symbols on the price board behind him. The SlaverÂ pushes him down the steps again.) Oh, that's barely enough to cover the expense of processing you. Outside. Outside! (The alien who spotted them tells another guard, but inside, T'Pol has felt her restraint switch off, so she hits the Tellarite and all the prisoners see the Slaver's control fail to bring her to her knees in agony.) Slaves are loose! Slaves are loose! (The alarms go off, slaves get out of the cages and run for it. Some encounter Orions with pain sticks.) You've got spirit. I might just keep you for myself. (But she frees herself with a well aimed kick to a sensitive area.) You've stolen our property! Disengage your warp drive, and deactivate your weapons.
