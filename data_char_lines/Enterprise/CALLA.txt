I'm glad you invited us here. Oh, very much. It has no name. It's our cogenitor. We're hoping to have a baby. For us, the aroma is far more important than the taste. If I had all day, I would have prepared a far more scented meal. Bringing a cogenitor to your ship was an exception. Why would you want to do that? I'll see if it's awake. [Sickbay] We're the ones being treated unfairly. Do you know how long we've waited to be given a cogenitor?
