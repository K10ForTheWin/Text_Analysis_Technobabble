We're stellar cartographers. We've had trouble digesting your food. They're officers of the Takret Militia. They've been pursuing us for weeks. We thought we could evade them by hiding aboard your ship. We used to be members of the militia, in the lower ranks, but after a year we realised that the commanding officers were corrupt. They seize alien vessels without provocation. They murder the crews, take anything of value. If they find us, we'll be executed.
