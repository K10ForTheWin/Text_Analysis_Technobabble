You've ignored our warnings. I'm well aware of your situation. Our scans show you're prepared to detach the hull segment surrounding the mine. Complete the procedure and leave this system immediately. One crewman. You have eighty two others safely aboard. Jettison the hull segment and leave. We will not tolerate espionage. (The ships recloak.)
Am I to be blamed for your incompetence? You brought the humans into this. I must leave Vulcan. My position here has been compromised. Not now. Your disappearance would cause suspicion. This is simply a minor delay. The reunification of our people is only a matter of time. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.
