T'Pol eventually determined that ships can only travel through this corridor in one direction. [Ready room - Lorian's narrative] You won't need to. We've encountered dozens of species. Some of them shared their propulsion technology with us. (She hands over a PADD.) Perhaps we should go to Sickbay. Phlox can confirm our identity. [Sickbay] We've doubled the efficiency of our atmosphere processors. We can give you those specs too. Many of our crew are descendants of Phlox. He and Amanda had nine children. My great grandmother was Ikaaran. Your wife. Her name was Esilia. You rescued her ship from an anomaly field. I'm sure they've picked us up on their sensors more than once. (she turns right unexpectedly) There's someone who'd like to see you first. [E2 - T'Pol's quarters] But Degra's not expecting us. But the plan could work. Do you expect him to simply give them to us? You're going to steal them? Their warp drive will be disabled. You're asking me to betray Jonathan Archer. They're targeting our nacelles. I can't. They've knocked out the starboard power couplings. We're losing main power. We can't do this. These people are family. I'm not going to let you kill them. Captain, it's over. The aliens are regrouping. Four ships. The aliens are closing. Twelve thousand metres, ten thousand. [Bridge] Direct hit. The pylons are starting to buckle.
