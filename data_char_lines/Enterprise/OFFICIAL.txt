Captain Archer? (A humanoid, grey hair at temples, ears with channel extending across cheek bone.) Are you prepared to receive Ambassador V'Lar? I regret there won't be time for that. The ambassador is already on her way to your ship. I assume the Vulcans have informed you of the urgency of this matter. V'Lar has been expelled for abuse of her position and criminal misconduct. [Docking hatch] (Ambassador V'Lar is a short, well-rounded mature woman.)
