Follow me. He was brought in yesterday. He's been badly burned. (they go to Archer's cot) Do you recognise the uniform?

If the swelling gets worse, it could inhibit her breathing. The monitoring equipment didn't detect the symptoms until this morning. [Medical unit] It isn't calibrated for this type of patient. (He checks the readout on the incubator's monitor/) Fever's diminished. She's fighting it off. Intravascular pressure has stabilised. Blood oxygenation is good. We don't want to disturb her.

(The doctor leaves, and nods to a big, big man who enters.)
