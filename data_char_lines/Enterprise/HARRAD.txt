Captain Archer. Harrad-Sar. Deactivate your weapon systems immediately, or I'll be forced to open fire. (pause for opening sequence) You're still targeting my ship. Not for long. Very well. (snaps fingers) I have a proposal to make. I prefer to discuss business in person. You're invited aboard my ship. What I have to say could smooth relations between your Starfleet and the Orion Syndicate. My hospitality is renowned, Captain. I don't offer it to everyone. And once I have been refused, I never offer it again. [Corridor and Transporter alcove] (The two officers are accompanied by two MACOs.) Can I be of help, Captain? Do you need a tow? We still have weapons. You're not going to get this ship without one hell of a fight. I'd rather I didn't have to kill you, but if that's what it takes. The Syndicate wants your head, Captain, and they don't really care whether or not it's attached to your body. (The Orion ship starts firing at Enterprise.) Relax, Captain. Enjoy the ride. I'm afraid you have an appointment with a pair of Orion marauders. I don't intend to keep them waiting. I can see you're upset, and I sympathise, but it's truly out of my hands. We are both slaves to the situation. You finally realise that. Yes, Captain, you've been operating under a misconception. It is the men who are the slaves, not the women. [Engineering]
