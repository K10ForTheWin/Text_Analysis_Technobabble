You're letting them send over more people? We can't have people crawling all over the place. And what if they find him? Maybe you didn't notice. We were in a battle. That's all right. You can just leave them. (Using her scanner, T'Pol discovers a girl hiding in an access port.) No. You nearly killed him. What about the Nausicaan? We've got what we wanted. Let's just get him off the ship. An escape pod. I've been asking myself the same question. We've always dealt with the Nausicaans without taking hostages or beating information out of them. How would the Captain want us to handle this? I've seen that hull signature enough times. Loaded and standing by. They're just sitting there, a hundred kilometres ahead near a small asteroid. We're closing. Twenty kilometres. They're firing. The hull plating is holding. We're out of range. (Another hit.) Ten kilometres, nine. Cannons locked on target. They've gone behind the asteroid. I've lost the lock. (As Fortunate pursues, we see that the asteroid is a docking port and facility for lots of Nausicaan ships.) I'm getting us out of here. Ryan! No effect. I used the ones he gave us. (Other ships undock and start attacking Fortunate.) The reactor is offline. We've lost impulse. They're hailing us. They've latched onto us. [Bridge] They're in the access corridor, section D. Three. We know what they're after. Why not just let them have him> It was one ship, not three. We should pull back. (They retreat into a cargo module and the Nausicaans try to cut in.) [Bridge] We'd better get him to the infirmary.
