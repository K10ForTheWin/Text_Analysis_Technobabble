At least this tastes like something. I thought we were headed for a nebula. There's a lot of plant life. It might be an oxygen atmosphere. Maybe they live underground or in the water. You'd think the Captain would make an announcement or something. Headache. If it's all right with you, I'd like to lie down for a while before we get back to work. Someone's out there. There's someone back there. I heard voices. Are you going to tell me I'm imagining things too? It's not safe here. Then why are they hiding? Why don't they come out and say hello? We should leave. It's better than being trapped in here. Go to hell! [Cavern]
