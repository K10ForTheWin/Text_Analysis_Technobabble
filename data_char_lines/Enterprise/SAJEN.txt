What are they doing here? This came today. (hands over a letter) What species are you? Never heard of them. Why did you bring them here? They could be working with Grat. [Common area] (Klev is doing a head count, and roughly shoves the little girl to one side.) It's a journal. I doubt anyone will ever read this. Why do you care? I see how you look at us. Suliban terrify you. You wouldn't be surprised if I slithered up this wall or turned my face inside out. Cabal, Suliban, it's all the same to you. We won't make it ten metres outside the complex before we're shot, like the others. And once we've made this miraculous escape, where do you expect us to go? It's too dangerous. You're placing a lot of trust in people you've only known for three days. For all we know they've been planted here to stage this revolt so Grat would finally have a reason to kill all of us. Think of your daughter. Are you willing to risk her life, too? I'm not going to help you plan our suicide. (leaves) What happened to you? Danik's been looking for your Captain. Have you seen him? I never asked for your help. No, wait. (Travis gives him his phase pistol then gets the other two out.)
