I tried re-initialising the plasma flow, but the power grid isn't charging. Commander? Are you all right, sir? Can I get you something? Rostov to Captain Archer. I'm sorry to bother you, sir, but I think there might be something wrong with Commander Tucker. [Bridge] He was confused, and seemed to think I was his superior officer. [Bridge] He's not here, sir. He left Engineering. No, sir. [Bridge] I'm afraid not, Captain. Commander! Problem? No, everything's fine. I have no idea how to do that. This engine is very complex.
We're going to have to sit in the back. I hate missing the beginning. It's not the same. You don't want to go back and see the first part after you know how it ends. It's probably just a blown relay. Leave it for the night shift. (bound further up the web) Captain? Leave. Leave. (The group back away, then Reed spots tentacles reaching out.) Why doesn't it just kill us? Yes, sir. She's still breathing. Captain? I imagine in a situation like this they'd cancel the movie. I really wanted to see it. Yves Montand driving explosives through the mountains. Thank you, sir. (Reed and other men enter the cargo bay, and fire off their light emitters.) [Situation room] Captain, I know it too, and I don't understand anything about water polo.
Do you want to take the helm, Captain? Isn't that what it's for? He said he was having trouble breathing when we were in the pod.
