(unknown language) harm us. (unknown) your request. We ask you not to harm us. We are complying with your request. We ask you not to harm us. I apologise for any damage we've caused. Our engines are malfunctioning and we've been using your plasma exhaust to replenish our teraphasic coils. It's allowed us to share your warp field. I hope the acclamation process wasn't too stressful. The perceptual tests are the best way to determine whether you're ready for our environment. We strongly recommend that you get some rest. Captain Archer? He'll be fine. When he came out of decompression he refused to rest. I strongly suggest he'd lie down for a while. We have a good deal of experience with alien visitors. [Xyrillian Engineering] I hope your mission hasn't been overly delayed. [on viewscreen]: I realise how difficult it must have been, adapting to our environment. I'd be pleased to give you a demonstration. (he leaves with the Klingons) I'm sure we can make the appropriate modifications. [Bridge]
