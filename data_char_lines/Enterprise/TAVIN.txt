Is this the Earth vessel Enterprise? My name is Tavin, Captain of the Vahklas. It's very good to meet you. (He's older, going grey, with a hint of a smile.) Not quite. We're a civilian ship. I suppose you could say we're on a mission of exploration. We're not typical Vulcans. I'd be happy to explain, but first I'd like to ask a favour. Our propulsion and life-support systems are in need of repair. We'd be grateful for any assistance you could offer.
