Is this the Earth vessel Enterprise? My name is Tavin, Captain of the Vahklas. It's very good to meet you. (He's older, going grey, with a hint of a smile.) Not quite. We're a civilian ship. I suppose you could say we're on a mission of exploration. We're not typical Vulcans. I'd be happy to explain, but first I'd like to ask a favour. Our propulsion and life-support systems are in need of repair. We'd be grateful for any assistance you could offer. We've noticed the High Command looking over our shoulders on several occasions as well. What is that? May I? (T'Pol glares then passes his plate.) It looks delicious. Eight years ago. Yes, but it's not space we're exploring. It's ourselves. Vulcans without logic. It's a name the Elders give to anyone who disagrees with the ancestral teachings, but it's not entirely accurate. We haven't abandoned logic. We've simply learned to exist without the need to continually repress our emotions. It's taken years of experimentation, but we've managed to find a balance between the two. Logic is an essential part of Vulcan existence, but it has to complement emotions, not exclude them. Not at all. [Engineering} My vessel is equipped with translinear sensors. We could help you complete the survey a good deal quicker.
