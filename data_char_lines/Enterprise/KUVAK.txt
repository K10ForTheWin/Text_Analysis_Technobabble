You're presiding over a massacre. We gave them that planet when we signed the treaty. Why would they move their forces there? Why weren't we informed of this? There are members of the Council who are not convinced an invasion is necessary at this time. Data can be falsified. Do you have evidence of this? Our patrol has returned. They captured eight Syrrannites from the sanctuary. No. He is dead. The Syrrannites say that there were three other survivors, including a human. They say that he is carrying the Kir'Shara. There are scholars who believe it does, and that it was hidden in the Forge. The Syrrannites claim that they are following the true path of Surak. If the Kir'Shara is real, it could prove them right. Seven alien ships have taken position outside the Andorian system. They are directly in the path of our fleet. [Bridge] The Andorians have more ships on the way. You told us this strike would be a surprise. That there would be minimal casualties on both sides. The Andorians are armed with standard particle cannons. There is no evidence of Xindi technology. Administrator, we have to call off this attack. Administrator, I can't allow this. Stay where you are. Is that? (T'Pau nods.) The artefact must be examined in detail. This is Minister Kuvak. Get me the Fleet Commander immediately. [Bridge] The people of Vulcan are in your debt. Peace, and long life. (Archer returns the salute.)
Your accomplishments have been noteworthy. How accurate is this information? Our goal isn't to exterminate these people. They're in the deep desert. What possible harm could they do us? Eventually, they're going to have to leave the Forge, and when they do, we can apprehend them with little or no loss of life. A surgical strike could minimize the loss of life. You're concerned about witnesses. So we're now monitoring their communications? Vulcan and Earth have been allies for a hundred years. You're presiding over a massacre.
