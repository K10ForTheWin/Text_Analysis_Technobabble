(a young man) Captain, we now have suspects. [Conference room] To create conflict between Earth and Vulcan. Syrrannites. Over the past year their leader, a dissident named Syrran, has become a dangerous zealot. T'Pau is a well-known Syrrannite. Captain, T'Pau is Vulcan. The Security Directorate will take charge of the investigation. Their assistance isn't required. This is now a Vulcan security operation. We'll inform Ambassador Soval of any developments that concern you. [Cargo Bay] (The place has been turned into a temporary morgue, with flag draped coffins laid out in rows of seven. Archer walks to the third one in on the second row from the door and places his hands on it. The bay doors open and close again.) A witness? The Syrrannite woman, T'Pau. I would like to interrogate this witness myself. Telepathic evidence is inadmissible.
T'Pau.
