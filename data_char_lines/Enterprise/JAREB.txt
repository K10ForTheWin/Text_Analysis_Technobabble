Lyaal's missing. He's not at his station. Internal sensors aren't functioning. Systems are down all over the ship. (Another alarm beeps.) One of the ships has lost engines. They're retreating. Their engines are at maximum. We're still gaining. Weapons aren't functioning. Pri'Nam! They're coming about.
