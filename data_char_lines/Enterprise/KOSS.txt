I need to speak with T'Pol. [T'Pol's family home - courtyard] I want to hear about your life aboard the human ship. You must have many fascinating stories. The answer should be obvious. The decision isn't ours alone. My parents believe in the old traditions. For them, a betrothal cannot simply be dismissed. I don't want another mate. Ill? I can help. My father's a man of influence. I knows the finest doctors in the province. I intend to go through with this. Is that what you want? A fight to the death? Perhaps your human friend would make a suitable challenger. No. Call a challenger if you wish. I'll do whatever's necessary. I may be able to help your mother. My father could have her reinstated. She was asked to resign. I've said more than I should. If we were to marry, you'd only have to live on Vulcan for one year. You could resume your career with Starfleet after that. I'd want you to be happy.
It is agreeable to see you. (They touch fingers.) Does a husband need a purpose to visit his wife? By necessity. The Syrrannite threat has brought new security measures into effect. Private communications are no longer private. Something to give you. Your mother asked me to deliver it personally. She told me that it's been in your family for generations, and now it's your turn to care for it. (He hands over a box containing an IDIC - a circle intersected by a triangle, with a stone at the centre.) The new security conditions. They've forced your mother into hiding to avoid arrest. She's a Syrrannite. [Ready room]
The Captain told me you were in danger. I wouldn't have been a very good husband if I didn't help. That's not why I've come. I'm releasing you from our marriage. I know you only bonded with me to help your mother. She's gone now. There's no reason for us to continue. I know. (He turns to leave.) Goodbye, T'Pol. [High Command]
