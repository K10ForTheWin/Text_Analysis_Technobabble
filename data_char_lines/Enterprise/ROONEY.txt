Over here! Definitely humanoid, but I don't recognise the species. I'm picking up EM traces a few dozen metres under the glacier. There's a lot more here than we're seeing. (she heads off following her scanner signals) We've got another one! [Base camp] (Two cybernetic looking corpses are laid out, and a mechanical arm gets put on a table.) Sir, I've run every test in the book. I still can't identify this alloy. I thought it was simple thermal damage until I found signs of antimatter residue. That could explain why there's not much debris. I did find some carbon traces. This debris has been here for about a hundred years. (They are distracted by a drill fitting on the prosthetic arm starting to whirl, and then stop again.Â Later -) (at microscope) Take a look at this. Do you see those devices? They're repairing the cell membranes. Oh! Plenty. Cybernetic corpses, digging through frozen remains in the middle of the night, why would I be jumpy? I've identified twenty two fragments of the outer hull. Each one has the same curvature. I think this ship was a perfect sphere. About six hundred metres in diameter. A warp signature. (It leads them to a cover.) ROONEY: Help me with this. (They start to open it) [Base camp]  Deuterium residue. Might be some kind of warp coil. I'd like to bring it back to the lab, take a closer look.(Back at Base camp, one of the medical monitors bursts into life, and Mister Eyepiece takes a deep breath, then his eye opens. A scream from the camp has Drake and Rooney rushing back.) [Base camp} (They burst into the lab to find a corpse is missing and Moninger lying on the floor.)
