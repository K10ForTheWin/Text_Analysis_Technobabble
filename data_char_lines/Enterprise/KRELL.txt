What do you want? [Qu'Vat Colony] Explain. The Council has shut down your project. The fleet will reach you in three days. If you're successful by the time we enter orbit, Qu'Vat will be spared. [Situation room] What now? Another one? Order them to withdraw. Then I'll destroy them. You did what I wanted. I don't need you anymore. And you believed me. [Laboratory] This is Fleet Admiral Krell. [Klingon Bridge] I'm under orders to eradicate this colony. [Laboratory] I have a more effective solution. [Laboratory] My orders are clear. [Klingon Bridge] Captain Archer, your ships are now the property of the Klingon Empire. Stand down or be destroyed! Proceed as planned. Leave nothing standing. [Bridge] You're lying! This is a cowardly attack! [Laboratory]
