Captain Archer, sir. Admiral Forrest needs you at Starfleet Medical right away. [Starfleet Medical - observation room] Go ahead. Acknowledged. Is someone wounded?
Thanks.
We've got a power fluctuation in the starboard nacelle, sir. Aye. sir.
Stun, sir? We've heard stories, sir. It might not be safe. Go ahead. I'll cover here.
Engineering. Yes, sir.
Sorry to disturb you sir, but I have an incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. It's Admiral Forrest. Yes, sir.
Security to Captain Archer. The aliens are gone, sir. They've launched their shuttle. (Another salvo at a nacelle and the green ship leaves.)

Their cloaking generator's down.
You're welcome, sir. (He leaves.) Doctor! (More casualties are being brought in.) [Bridge]

How should I know? The navigation relay's still not responding. I think they've been re-routed. I'm not certain. [Engineering] Not yet. We could lose our ship by staying here. We should take what we can and leave. Less than eight minutes. Three minutes.
Commander.
We're okay. No, sir.
Doctor?
Aye, sir. (The pair beam into a place of green lighting and electricity arcing on the Arctic transport, with lots of strange tubing around, and regeneration alcoves.) [Bridge] (The attack continues, and a piece of hull gets blown off.)
Bridge to Captain Archer.
Commander? Twice.
Captain. (Some eggs are starting to hatch.) [Outside T'Pol's quarters] (Tucker is clutching his shoulder and looking uncomfortable.)
Yes, sir.
Engineering to the Bridge. We just picked up a surge in the EPS grid on A deck. (Bang! Everyone ducks and rubble lands on the central display console.)
Aye sir.
He'll alert the others.
One Reptilian transported to the weapon.
Security to Captain Archer. There's weapons fire on G deck, outside the Tellarites' quarters.
I said leave it alone!
The cloak's not responding, sir. [USS Defiant - Bridge] Engineering to Bridge. The containment fields are failing. Negative. Reactor breach in three minutes.
Yes, sir. [Briefing room]
