I wanted to thank you. You were very kind this morning, helping me find the Mess Hall. Wow. Is that the engine? You can feel the power. You promised you'd show me Engineering. Harrad-Sar never let us leave our rooms. I've never seen anything like this place. If it won't get you into trouble. That's where the matter and antimatter mix. The crystals let you control the reaction. You're better than him. Tucker's going to take back his position? It doesn't seem fair. I'm used to being with men who take what they want. You can't let him treat you like this. I thought you were different. What would you do to keep me forever? What would you do? Your crewman acted alone. I had nothing to do with it. They were very accommodating. You heard your Captain.
