(a fancy nose) I'm closed. You'll have to come back later. Captain Archer? I remember now. How are you? Of course. Trellium-A is extremely common, easy to synthesise, but trellium-D is rare, difficult to process. I'm confident we can agree on a fair price. I was thinking about you recently, Captain. You were very eager to learn about the Xindi, as I recall. What is your interest in them? A diplomatic mission. Some Xindi arrived here last week. I thought you might be interested. They had business with another merchant. I'd be happy to direct you, for a small fee. What's this one called? Of course. I've reviewed your engineering specifications. You appear to have the necessary equipment to produce liquid trellium-D. Trellium can only be synthesised in a liquid state. It's just as effective as the natural ore. There is one thing. Be sure to follow the protocols precisely. Let's just say that in it's liquid form, trellium-D is extremely unstable. (B'rat hands over the PADD and carries on sampling the peppers.)
