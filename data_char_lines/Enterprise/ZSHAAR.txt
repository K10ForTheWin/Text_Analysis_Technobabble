You are on an unauthorised course. Leave immediately. Captain Khata'n Zshaar. I have orders to destroy any vessel that violates our territory. Why is there a Vulcan on your bridge? Turn your ship around. We sent a patrol ship to intercept your shuttle. We have also lost contact. If your shuttle did encounter my patrol ship, your crewman is already dead.
