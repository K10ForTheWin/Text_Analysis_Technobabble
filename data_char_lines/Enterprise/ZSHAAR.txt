You are on an unauthorised course. Leave immediately. Captain Khata'n Zshaar. I have orders to destroy any vessel that violates our territory. Why is there a Vulcan on your bridge? Turn your ship around. We sent a patrol ship to intercept your shuttle. We have also lost contact. If your shuttle did encounter my patrol ship, your crewman is already dead. We never received a call. You told me these moons are dangerous. So why haven't you rescued your pilot? If I allowed a Vulcan access to an Arkonian ship, I'd be executed. And your crewman? If I discover that my pilot fired on your shuttle without provocation, he'll be disciplined. I expect you to leave this system immediately, as agreed. (Zshaar leaves.)
