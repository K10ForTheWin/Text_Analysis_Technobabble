(a student carrying books) I'll play. Come on, Mom, we could use the money. Want to shoot some eight ball? I've got a geometry midterm next week. It's good practice. It's what I want to study at college. Mechanical engineering, if I get to go. Only a partial one. Your break. [Vulcan's apartment] (T'Mir is browsing through books while Mestral watches a western on TV. Stron is wearing his hair long over his ears.) I was just going to play some pool. I didn't mean to bother you. What are you doing? Really? Are you just trying to clear your mind, or reach a higher spiritual plane? I spend a lot of time at the library. Different things. Mostly about places I'd like to visit, like Tibet. The Buddhist monks there meditate every day. And in India, they're got these mystics called fakirs. Supposedly they can almost stop their hearts just by using willpower. Astronomy, literature. Sometimes I'll just pick a book off the shelf and start reading. What about you, what do you like to read? Oh really? Did you know that minutes after dusk, when the sun is just right you can see Sputnik with the naked eye. Maybe tomorrow I could show you. Oh. It's amazing, don't you think? Well, I'll let you get back to your meditating. It was nice talking to you. I hear you're leaving. Where to? I'm going to miss you. You're about the most interesting people I've met in this town. I'm not going. We couldn't come up with the rest of the money. The deadline for the tuition's Friday, so I'll reapply, but there's no guarantee. And if not, there's always the library. Still a lot of books I haven't read. Good luck up north. Carbon Creek's not exactly a vacation spot, but I hope you'll come visit us.
