(a woman) We'll assist you. [Sickbay] Your wound is healing well. You'll be able to walk on your own in a few hours. You're Captain Archer. We have a strict law here, Captain. No one may enter another's thoughts without permission. I know your name because the Andorian Chancellor contacted us. We assign our leaders as the need arises. For this occasion, I have been chosen as Speaker. I know what the Andorians have told us. Someone's been attacking your ships, and you believe we're involved. It will save time and foster our trust, if I can have your thoughts. (Shran shakes his head.) You have an interesting mind, Captain. Many facets. Some of those facets are in conflict. The evidence you've gathered appears irrefutable. It seems there was an Aenar controlling that ship. We're a nonviolent people. That a member of our race could cause so much death, it's extremely disturbing. There's one possibility. A year ago, one of our citizens disappeared while collecting ice-bores. We assumed he'd been killed in an accident, but we never found his body. Gareb would not be doing this voluntarily. It's the best explanation. This device that you're building aboard your ship. You will need one of us to operate it. I'll consult with the others. [Mess hall] Not with violence. I won't deny that your intentions are honourable, but our decision stands. It's time to come back. She's betraying her people. Jhamel. Very well. (Her image vanishes and they see that they are at the surface, with the ringed planet hanging in the sky.) Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've returned to Enterprise, where we received word that the cargo ship Ticonderoga is missing. [Corridor]
