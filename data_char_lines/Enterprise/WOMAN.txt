Jonathan. Jonathan. Jonathan. (Archer turns on a light and goes into the jungle to search.) Jonathan. I need you, Jonathan. I need you to understand. If you didn't know me, would you have come? You're different. Harm. Not Jonathan. Jonathan. Real, yes. Human? We are not like you. We can become whatever you see. A tree, an animal, water, whatever you see. Because you want to see a beautiful woman. I can see your thoughts. I see what eludes you. I know more than your language. You do know me. You're different. The others. The only ones who have ever come here, before you. Do you know why they come? To hunt us, Jonathan. We are what they prize above all else. [Campsite] Yes. For now. Yes. Thank you. You remembered. Never stop seeking what seems unobtainable. Goodbye, Jonathan. (She touches his face, he takes her hand.) Don't forget me. (She morphs into a giant slug and glides away.)
Welcome to Burgerland. How may I serve you, sir? You can make that a triple for only forty cents extra. Would you like to make that a combo? Will there be anything else today? You can make that a double for only forty cents extra. Would you like to make that a combo? Will there be anything else today? No, but we can add three strips of bacon for only seventy five cents more.
Of course.
Why are any of us here? (A siren goes off, other Suliban come out of their rooms and stand still. In the open area, four military looking men walk around the Suliban there, until one drops his cup. When he bends to pick it up, the leader zaps his hand with his stick and moves on.)
Tikara. The nights are always beautiful. Really? Most people wouldn't bother. How long will you be here?. Exceptionally. You hardly have any accent. It's been nice talking to you. Goodnight.
