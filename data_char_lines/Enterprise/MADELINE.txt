He once told me that he loved to eat octopus, especially the little suction cups, but I think he was pulling my leg. You can never tell whether my brother's joking or not. Can I talk to him? Oh right, the dinner. I remember one time, this was at least ten years ago, he went for a whole week without eating. Got by on nothing but water and a little apple juice. Some sort of survival training. Or was it a contest? He was so weak he could barely get out of bed. For two days all he had was protein concentrate. Not that I remember. Malcolm isn't the easiest person to get to know.
