What gives you the right to approach a Klingon warship? And what would that be? You've been monitoring our systems. For how long? (to subordinate) Find this vessel. Find them! (Three photons light up the Xyrillians and a tractor beam grabs them.) Bring their Captain to me and execute the others. What you need is to turn your puny ship around and leave. These aliens violated our security and disrupted our systems. Both are considered acts of war against the Empire. They won't get home, but I'm more than willing to hasten their journey to Sto-Vo-Kor. You're wasting my time. I am frightened by nothing, PetaQ. He talks too much. I'll bring a security team. If their technology amuses me, I may spare their lives. I don't need your engineer to help me make that decision. I am not interested in your engineer's business. I thought you said you were there to fix their warp reactor, not to impregnate one of their females. This should be a lesson to you. Forget it happened. This is a topographical survey of our capital. (pointing) You can see my house from here. Can this technology be adapted to our power matrix? As soon as the installation is complete, the Xyrillians will be free to go. Listen to me very carefully. Our debt is repaid. We have no interest in meeting you again, and if we do, I promise, you'll regret it. [Captain's mess]
