(grey hair in a ponytail) Who are you? I hope you won't think I'm rude but there are many other caverns here to explore. Why? We're sorry you came all this way, but we're not leaving. You've warned us about the situation, Commander. You've accomplished your mission. All the more reason for us to stay down here where we're safe. Rocks? This is the most remarkable collection of speleothems we've ever seen. There's calcite, aragonite, botyroidal flowstone. I've spent fourteen years searching for tractosites this perfect. These samples can provide clues to prevent seismic disasters on Denobula. You can't force us to leave. We have a lot of samples. We'll need your help. Nothing. (Yolen moves some rocks concealing another case like the one found earlier.) I just need a moment. It took us six weeks to extract these from the rock bed. These are priceless. We don't have any climbing gear. Commander, the bombing seems to have stopped. My speleothems! Fortunately, I have some other samples in my case. [Bridge]
