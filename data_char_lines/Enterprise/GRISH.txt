(piloting) Irr gnales. Nohm setron quethivoo. I agree with Krem. Let's take what we have and go. Thirty-five percent. That's not a bad offer, Ulis. Maybe we should consider it. You're not scanning deep enough. This is their vault. I saw one just like it on a Gavarian ship. It must use some sort of magnetic seal. I'll need micro-charges to blow it open. Empty. Looking for the vault. I know that, but look. If I'm not mistaken these are the Captain's quarters. [Outside the Bridge] (T'Pol is eavesdropping on the alien's conversation.) That's where you keep your latinum. [Situation room] We could take this elevator to this deck [Outside the Bridge] And cut through here. Over here! (T'Pol sneaks in and takes some of the small boxes Muk has collected.) Make it stop! (Muk shoots T'Pol's console and the noise stops.) Please, gentlemen. We're partners. [Outside the Bridge] Don't look at me. Get away. Where is the vault? Do you understand me? (Porthos wages his tail and woofs.) I can't lock on to its language. Don't be so sure. Look at the size of its ears. The anaesthesia isn't supposed to wear off for another two hours. Maybe we used the wrong dosage. There could be others awake. We should leave. If he's going, I'm going. That's Krem's job. Isn't there a more direct route? The vault? We don't have all day. Thief! I want my share! My gold! My gold! (The three dash into the room, where T'Pol is hiding behind the door.) Whatever he offers you, I'll double it.
