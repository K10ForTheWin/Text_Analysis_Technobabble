Several hours ago, you launched a small vessel to an encampment in the Cygniai Expanse. Would you tell me why? By whom? Chancellor Trellit. Why are you in contact with this man? Hospitality? I hope you're aware that most likely you'll never see your Captain or Engineer again. [Encampment] (Trip is sent head over heels by a tackle. Archer helps him up.) And you assured me your people would be leaving the surface. Why didn't they? Interesting. Where are they now? You expect us to stand by while you send more people to join Zobral? Of course, I forgot. They just went down for the hospitality. That's what you promised before. We'll locate your men ourselves and deal with them accordingly. That's assuming they haven't already been killed. If you attempt to launch another shuttlecraft, we'll have no choice but to consider it as an enemy vessel. (Ends transmission.)
