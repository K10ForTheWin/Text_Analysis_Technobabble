Not me personally. We have an assignment for you. There's a job that needs doing, Lieutenant, and it may be the only way to save your friend's life. [Laboratory] (Phlox is brought in by two Klingons.)
Captain Archer, I'm told you have some questions for me. He's safe, on a mission of great importance to Starfleet. Reread the Charter, Article 14, Section 31. There are a few lines that make allowances for bending the rules during times of extraordinary threat. Take your pick. Earth's got a lot of enemies. What I want to talk about is Lieutenant Reed. He's done good work for us over the years. Don't be too hard on him. He was just following my orders. I can understand why you would feel that way, but this is bigger than one captain and one ship. All I can tell you is that if you interfere before Phlox completes his assignment, the repercussions will affect entire worlds. [Laboratory] (Phlox is holding four vials of green stuff.)

She was more than just an emotionally troubled nurse. She was a member of an underground isolationist movement, Terra Prime. They believe it's corrupting our way of life. They had a resurgence following the Xindi attack. We think Khouri was trying to leave the movement. Her defection may have had something to do with the child. The child belongs to two of your crewmen. You tell me. That doesn't seem likely, does it? I admire your loyalty. We think Terra Prime is involved, and that they're planning something. We suspect it has something to do with the child. Find it, and we'll have the answers. [Paxton's office] (The establishing monochrome shot suggests we're on Moonbase Alpha.)
