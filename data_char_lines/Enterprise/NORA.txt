(blonde woman with pony-tail) I heard we had a visitor. I still can't believe he's gone. I'm so sorry, Travis. Aren't you a little old for this? And get grounded again? That wouldn't look too good on your Starfleet record. How's Enterprise? In eighteen months? Columbus, Magellan, Travis Mayweather. How long are you home for? Any chance of getting an extended leave? I don't mean to spoil your visit, but things haven't exactly been running like clockwork since your father died. We missed a rendezvous with an Orion freighter two weeks ago. The Cargo Authority wasn't too pleased. We're also low on deuterium. We've had to dip into the reserves twice this month. Morale's been better, Travis. Horizon's lost its captain, and some of the crew are starting to wonder if Paul's ready for the job. You might have noticed he's been a little on edge. More than usual. I guess she didn't want to worry you. I hope you're right. I'm sure this is the last thing you wanted to hear right now, but I thought you should know. Just a little spatial turbulence. You've gotten spoiled on Enterprise. (A harder judder, then another.)
