Nass. (Muk tells him to hurry up.) Ehj saf-rey tomen-dee. Ooo. Senpa tah-moy. Lorala rrela. Latinum soun teyvalah. Ehj ocuuz sahfi? Maybe the translator's malfunctioning. Cousin, maybe we should. We've made some good acquisitions already. Don't forget about the females. Some of them are worth their weight in latinum. If we leave now we can make the next slave market on Stameris. I already have. Why am I always stuck doing the menial labour? Oh, not there. Over here. It's not my ship. It's my cousin's. This is only my first month on the job. My cousin's a skillful merchant. I'm learning a lot from him. You'd better slide that over to make room for the others. One can never have too much. The Rules of Acquisition say 'Expand or die'. That's rule number forty five. I've memorised all a hundred and seventy three, including the most important one. A man is only worth the sum of his possessions. You should've managed your businesses better. Come on. We have a lot more moving to do. Oh, my cousin determines the shares. Actually, I get the smallest. My cousin knows what's best for me. He manages all my financial transactions. I don't have the lobes for business. Of course. (Archer spots Trip hiding around a corner.) KREM: He wouldn't be a very good businessman if he didn't. Never allow family to stand in the way of profit. Number six. My cousin's going to help me acquire my own ship some day. I'll be right back. This is pretty good. Maybe we should take your cook with us. This female is different from the others. What species is she? Vulcan.  (Archer wheels a cabinet away.) I'd like to get to know this one. Maybe I won't sell her. Not right away. There. That one. Would you mind? Warp core parts are in high demand. We have a contract. He wouldn't cheat me. How do I know you won't double-cross me? Get back to work. I'll ask Ulis. I'm not the one in charge. She's not the one with the pointy ears, is she? Me, too. I'm tired of doing this job. I don't want to do all the menial work. It's time that I showed a little initiative. I have the lobes for business. You just never give me the chance to prove it. Yes, cousin. (The others leave.) Get back to work. (Archer leans over and goes ouch.) What about it? We don't have any time. If Ulis comes back and we're not finished. How did you wake up? Humans? Then why do you live with them? You would make a handsome wife. Do you know how to perform oo-mox? My lobes. Stroke my lobes. Yes. (Krem turns to jelly in her hands) Oh, yes! (Then she neck-pinches him, and takes the handcuff keys and a phase pistol.) [Jefferies tube] You'll never see us again. (The other three are tied up.) Later, maybe. If you're nice. Shut up! (to T'Pol) Are you sure you want to stay here with the hu-mans? With my ship and your talents we could build a vast fortune. (T'Pol walks away, Archer right behind her.) No thanks. Makes me sneeze.
