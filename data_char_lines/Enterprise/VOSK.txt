You should have chosen a safer route, and you should have personally overseen the transfer. He was more than that. This communication device he was carrying. It's from the future. Double the security details at all the entrances to the compound. If they have located us, it won't be long before they strike. If the prisoner hadn't escaped, we might know the answer to that question. You know what I expect of you. The weapon fires a modulating plasma pulse equivalent to the energy produced by three eighty eight millimetre shells. Each pulse can destroy a tank. I can't give you a specific timetable. There are still some problems to be addressed. Portability. The weapons require considerable power. In my century, there are energy cells the size of a coin.
