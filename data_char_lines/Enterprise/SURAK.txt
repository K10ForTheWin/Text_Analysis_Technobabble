War is taking its toll. Vulcan is tearing itself apart. You know who I am, Captain. So much death. Hard to believe this will become known as the Time of Awakening. You're seeing the past through my eyes. He chose you. You don't trust Vulcans, Captain. And, given your experiences with them, I can't say I blame you. The culture you've come to know isn't the one I helped to create. My people have strayed, and someone must restore them to the path. Sorry, Captain. There's an Earth expression, We're stuck with each other. Don't fight what's been given to you. Open your mind and your heart and the way will become clear. Good to see you again, Captain. My appearance must be quite disconcerting. I apologise. We're paying a heavy price for our foolishness. Logic has not won this day, but this day won't last forever. Logic is at the heart of every Vulcan. Even as the ashes fall, my people are discovering a new way. You can accomplish what Syrran could not. Was a Vulcan, and you're human. Which means you are untouched by a culture that can no longer see its own imminent destruction. We cannot let what happened to the Vulcans of my time take place again. Find what my people have lost. Find the Kir'Shara. (Surak dies, the telepathic link is broken.)
He chose you.
