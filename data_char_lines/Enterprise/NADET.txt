Poison rain. I was no taller than a digger, but I can still see back. We lived on the overside, then the humans dropped the poison, burned our skin, gutted the grown ones. There was no place to go but here. My parents were Novans. They came from the overside. [Sickbay] (The woman is in the body scanner, and very unhappy.) No more! Let me out! You humans tried to gut our go-befores when they lived on the overside. Now you're trying to gut us. It's the overside, before the poison rain. Humans. Nadet? Bernadette? You say this is me? It's Akary. [Well] (Akary is trapped under a log at the bottom of the well.) Tell them. Tell them what Archer said about the islands to the south. We're not fine. None of us is fine. We're rotting, all of us. I've seen back. Vera Fuller was my mother. That girl in the picture was me, a human girl. Our go-befores shared the same path. We should listen. [Captain's mess]
