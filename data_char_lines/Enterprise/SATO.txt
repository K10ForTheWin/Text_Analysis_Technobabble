Captain Archer. Is everything all right? Transporting device? What is that? Bio-matter? What are you referring to, produce or people? So, Hoshi is safe. Her molecules? What are you talking about, Captain? Family? We're her family, not you. Why are you calling me? To say that she has become a member of your family? I'm sorry, Captain. You are not making any sense. (Hoshi finds a conduit that makes a noise when she 'touches' it.) You are saying Hoshi is dead? Maybe, you could call us back later. This afternoon? I must have time to speak to Hoshi's mother. So am I. (Transmission ends.)
