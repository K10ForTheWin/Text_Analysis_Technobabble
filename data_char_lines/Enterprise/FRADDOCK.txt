Can I help you? Pleased to meet you. What do you want? Oh. A job. I'm escorting a group of spiritually minded men on a pilgrimage to the Great Plume of Agosoria. Every eleven years, one of the protostars gives out a neutron blast. These gentlemen believe it's a sacred event. If you ask me, I think it's just another ball of hydrogen. Tomorrow. It's your time to waste. I'll ask them if they're interested. I prefer to stay with my ship. Fraddock. Captain Fraddock. (Ends transmission) You might want to focus your sensors on that plasma lightning up ahead. You ever been in a plasma storm? Then you know it can get a little bumpy. I suggest we try and go around it. I spoke with every one of them. Him, too. None of them went anywhere near that conduit. If I told you I did it, would there be some kind of reward? Maybe it was the Cycle of Renewal. Oh, you'll be the first. [Corridor] Fraddock. None. The hatch has been sealed the entire time.
