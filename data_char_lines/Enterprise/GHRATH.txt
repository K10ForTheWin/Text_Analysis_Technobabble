We were in the midst of a crucial weapons test. He was just an American prisoner. A temporal agent? How could they have possibly found us? The prisoner will be recovered. [Ready room] We're conducting extensive sweeps within a fifteen mile radius of the ambush. We haven't found the prisoner, but we have taken in several members of the resistance. They're being interrogated. There's one that I suspect took part in the ambush. Yes? You. What do you want? I have nothing to say to you. You're not what I expected. Temporal agents are usually more informed. You wouldn't understand. Because it suits us. We're trapped. The Germans are helping us construct a conduit so we can find our way home. We know you're from the future. We detected your ship in orbit. It has the same markings that were on your uniform. You find it.
We're trapped. The Germans are helping us construct a conduit so we can find our way home.
