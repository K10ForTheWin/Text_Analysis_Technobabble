My dear Doctor Phlox, it's me again, Jeremy. I hope you are well. It's been a hell of a week here. Wall to wall emergencies and three midnight deliveries. It's mating season, so you know how that goes. I thought human reproduction was complicated. You Denobulans make us look like single-cell organisms.
I asked you never to bother me when I'm watching a viropathic cytolysis. Did you contact Security? (trying himself) The system's been taken offline. (Gas starts coming in through a ceiling vent.) What the hell? ? (They start coughing, but before he passes out, Lucas manages to trigger a Code Black Security Alert.) [Captain's mess] (Smike follows Archer's lead when it comes to using cutlery.) I don't have the code. They changed the policy after what you did. The access code can only be obtained through Starfleet Command. I'm telling the truth. Every two hours. Drives me crazy. We're all right. No one's been hurt. So do I. That's a mistake in the log. You son of a bitch. You can't do this. I can't. I have orders. How can you? Go to hell! Phlox. What are you doing here? It's good to see you again. No! No. No. I'll give it to you. Don't kill him! I'll give it to you! Four minutes to containment breach. There's no way to stop it from here. The primary junction.
There's no way to stop it from here. The primary junction.  He's isolated this room. The pathogens can't reach us. The ventilation grid is going to carry the pathogens through the rest of the station, including the central core. [Station core] (Alarms are going off) Less than a minute. [Station core]
