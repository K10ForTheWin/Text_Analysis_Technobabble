Please wait. (He leaves.) Forgive the disarray. Kolinahr encourages the members of our order to face their vestigial emotions. The repercussions can sometimes be violent. Please. This is the stone of J'Kah, which represents the foundation of all we believe. A life of order and control through logic. (Archer puts his hand on the stone.) Ishte acula bestalma itok, J'Kah. It is a traditional litany, passed down for generations. Please, you must leave now. It's an Earth vessel. I didn't know. In order to alleviate tensions, we negotiated a treaty, but some Andorian factions still believe we're bent on conquest. They believe we are hiding a long range sensor array. This is a place of introspection, Captain. There are no spies her, and no technology. The Andorians were here twice before and both times left within a day. Unfortunately your arrival has amplified their suspicions. How long have you lived on the Earth ship? The smell must be intolerable. There is nothing to find. There is an option. A transmitter. It's very old. It hasn't been used in many years. It may not even be working. Please listen to me, Captain. There are hidden passages beneath us where we keep our most sacred relics, our honoured dead. If the Andorians discover them they will damage our culture in ways you can't begin to understand. (The Elder turns a statue and pushes open a panel.) There is one to spare. (to Archer) It's only going to get colder. No. To do so would be blasphemy. I don't have to tell you, Captain. We don't condone these actions you are about to take. I hope you're pleased, Captain. You've turned a place of solitude into a war zone. Violence is no longer our way.
