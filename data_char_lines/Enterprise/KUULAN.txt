(grey-haired man in brown) We were on our way back from our colony on Kotara Barath. We came under attack as we passed this system. They didn't introduce themselves, they just opened fire. If we had, it would have let the raiders know where we were. We didn't have much choice. You're very generous, Captain, but our world is over a year away. As you say, we've made a home for ourselves. Commander? I hear you've been making progress. There is something else you might be able to help us with. [Alien computer core] (A room with lots of large bolt-heads stuck on the walls and a central console with five conduits coming out of the top of it.) It controls all the ship's vital functions. Environmental systems, main power. You might say it keeps us alive. Yes, and the system's beginning to degrade. It could fail at any time. Then you can fix it? Thank you, Commander, but we still have a lot to do here. Another time. Do you need some help? Because of what you found? You were looking where you shouldn't have. [Alien ship] (The shuttlepod has landed, and Archer, Reed, Liana and Trip have entered the alien ship.) Liana. Take their weapons. When the repairs are completed. (Trip is marched away at gunpoint.) Go back to your ship. This isn't a negotiation. (Archer and Reed leave.)
