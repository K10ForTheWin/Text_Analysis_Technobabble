(Temporal chamber) Have your ships bring me Archer.
(to Archer) The probe was sent by the Xindi. They learned that their world would be destroyed by humans in four hundred years.
They weren't acting alone. Have your ships bring me Archer. Allow Enterprise to continue. Archer. You know what happened the last time you failed me. [Ready room]
You failed in your last mission. The Klingon Empire is intact. You knew there would be consequences. We'll restore it, but only if you succeed in your next mission. You won't need enhanced vision where you're going. Proceed with the extraction. (A Suliban medic aims a long needle at Silik's eye.) [Turbolift]
Where's Klaang? Did you lose anyone else? Our agreement doesn't provide for correcting mistakes. Recover the evidence. Don't be concerned with when. [Sickbay] Did Sarin give them anything? What do you know? Looking for Klaang, or for you? We didn't plan to involve the humans or the Vulcans. Not yet. Sarin's message cannot reach Kronos. If the humans have it, you must stop them. [Bridge]
Your planet was attacked. What you're not aware of is why. The probe was sent by the Xindi. They learned that their world would be destroyed by humans in four hundred years. They were told by people from the future. People who can communicate through time. The Suliban work for me. The people who have contacted the Xindi belong to another faction. The probe was only a test. The Xindi are building a far more powerful weapon. When it is completed, they will use it to destroy Earth. You have no choice but to believe me. [Ready room]
