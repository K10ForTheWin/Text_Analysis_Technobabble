(pink eyes, grey skin and huge forehead) To answer your first question, I regret I cannot offer free samples. I always welcome referrals. What is your pleasure? Excellent customers. They purchased two U'tani serpent women. I'm afraid I don't have any more, but perhaps I could interest you in a Nuvian concubine? She's quite skilled. I believe they left orbit two days ago. I wouldn't stay in business very long if I revealed confidential information about my clients, but I have females here from many worlds. Who knows, perhaps one of them can tell you what you want to know about the Xindi. (Archer looks around, starts to move away, then stops and turns to look at a blonde woman in white.) You have an excellent eye, my friend. She can be very accommodating. How can you walk away from such beauty? Stop her! (The woman in white puts her arms around Archer's neck.) She seems determined to be sold today. Let's go back to my shop and arrange for payment. Then I'll take my merchandise. If you're so concerned about what she wants, buy her. Otherwise, stay out of this. (Zjod pulls a weapon and grabs for Rajiin, Reed pulls his phaser, Zjod and Archer fight, knocking over barrels, until Archer throws him through a window.)
