Leave me alone. Get out of my way. Who are you? It hurts. My real name's Udar, but my brothers and sisters call me Smike. It's from Nicholas Nickleby. I would've slowed them down. Smike. I'm not telling you anything. You're from Earth. You don't want to help them, you want to kill them. I won't betray my brothers and sisters. Then more Klingons will die. You'll never stop them, Captain. No one will. So I've been told. Do I have a choice? I left the camp about a year ago. It wasn't that hard. School? How can I go to school if I'm in prison? I'm an Augment. That's not what my father said. What do you mean? How do you know that? Do you really think I can help? Doctor Phlox missed something when he examined me, Captain. I do have one enhanced ability. I can hear like they do. They're coming. (A MACO gets shot.) Father. I'm going to stay. You too, Father. [Bridge]
