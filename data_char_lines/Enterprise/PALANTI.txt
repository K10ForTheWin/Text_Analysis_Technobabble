We've searched every deck. There's no sign of the fugitives. It appears they have deserted the ship. I'm having difficulty with the dilithium matrix. Palanti to Captain. [Bridge] The dilithium matrix is active. [Engineering] We're ready to initialise the warp reactor. Acknowledged. [Catwalk] We're being hailed. No. It's coming from within this vessel. He's somewhere on the fifth deck. It'll take me much longer than that. We should evacuate. You heard what he said. He's willing to destroy his own ship. [Catwalk command area] Spatial disturbance. We're four minutes from the eddy. (Everybody is hanging on in the turbulence as loose objects fall from shelves.) Unless you've found a way to turn this ship around I strongly suggest we abort the mission.
