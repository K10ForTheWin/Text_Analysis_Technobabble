No matter how angry Logan's threats may have seemed, there had to have been a way of dealing with this other than attacking us. Nearly half the adults are dead, including Doctor Tracey, and everyone else is getting sick, except for the younger children. If they have any chance of surviving, the least you could do is have the Vulcans send a ship for them, but for all I know they were the ones you talked into attacking us. You wanted Terra Nova enough to do this? Well it's yours now, but I doubt you'll be very pleased with what you find when you get here.
