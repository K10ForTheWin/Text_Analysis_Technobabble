(a woman, if it matters) That's what I'm trying to determine. Commander Collins, Starfleet Security. You told me before that one of them said something to the others. The only DNA we've recovered belongs to Ensign Sato and to your Doctor. We did find some residual ionisation traces here. Very few people have access to that kind of technology. Doctor Phlox was involved in an altercation the last time he was in San Francisco. Assaults against aliens are still pretty rare. If the man who attacked him was holding a grudge We're pursuing all avenues. Excuse me, Captain. Lieutenant. (She leaves the group)
