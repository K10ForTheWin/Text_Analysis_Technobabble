Secure him. (He is fastened into a chair.) Welcome to Qu'Vat Colony, Doctor. You will work with Doctor Antaak. Then you will die. You misunderstand me, Doctor. Antaak will be assisting you. I will let you two get reacquainted. I suggest you work quickly, Doctor. I expect a progress report by sunrise. (He leaves with one guard, leaving the other by the door.) Very observant. He won't be alive much longer. Proceed. [Reed's quarters] Is that really such a surprise, Doctor? It took only two human Augments to commandeer a Bird of Prey and murder its entire crew. The Empire could not allow an inferior species to gain an advantage on us. Imagine, every Starfleet vessel manned with genetically engineered humans. The Vulcans told that to the High Council. They weren't very persuasive. We were simply responding to a threat. If you hope to ever leave this place, I suggest you stop asking questions and resume work. [Science lab] {The two women are looking at a mangled black something.) We're running out of time. If you don't accelerate your efforts, there will be no one left to cure. The High Council has dispatched the fleet. They have annihilated N'Vak Colony. The Council will do whatever's required to contain this outbreak. Millions will be infected by then. The Council will not wait! Five days. The experiment failed! You could save the inhabitants of this planet. Take him. (Phlox is bustled out of the laboratory.) [Colombia Bridge]
The Denobulan is close to perfecting the Augment's genome.
