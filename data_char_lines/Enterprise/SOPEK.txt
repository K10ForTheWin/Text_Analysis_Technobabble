We've dealt with this sort of threat in the past. Swift, decisive action is the logical response. They've threatened the life of a Vulcan officer. We must discourage any such incidents in the future. I've already been in contact with the Chancellor. She's given me full authority to implement this action. It is not Vulcan policy to negotiate with terrorists. (Sopek turns to leave.) Any data you may have on the location of your Captain and the Sub-Commander would be useful. Put down your weapons! She's no longer your responsibility. We'll treat her on the Ni'Var. (Archer picks T'Pol up.) Will she live? Nothing can excuse what she did at the sanctuary. I can't return without her. I'm meeting with the High Command in three days. Perhaps, if there's time, I'll discuss this matter with them.
