Where's Captain Archer? Inform him that we'll be arriving within the hour. You obviously made an error in your calculations. Please have Sub-commander T'Pol ready to depart when we arrive. How convenient. How do you know this? It would be irrational to kill the hostages. They would lose their negotiating position. Since the situation involves a Vulcan officer, we will take over the investigation. It would be best if you refrained from any foolish endeavours. Your vessel is ill-equipped to mount a rescue mission. You would most likely become captives yourselves. My team will penetrate their base of operations. We've dealt with this sort of threat in the past. Swift, decisive action is the logical response. They've threatened the life of a Vulcan officer. We must discourage any such incidents in the future. I've already been in contact with the Chancellor. She's given me full authority to implement this action. It is not Vulcan policy to negotiate with terrorists. (Sopek turns to leave.) Any data you may have on the location of your Captain and the Sub-Commander would be useful. This is Sopek. Where's Commander Tucker? I want to know where that shuttlepod was going. The one that left your launch bay nine minutes ago. I want to know where Commander Tucker is. Your presence here is a violation of the Tau Ceti Accords. Put down your weapons! She's no longer your responsibility. We'll treat her on the Ni'Var. (Archer picks T'Pol up.) How is she? Will she live? Nothing can excuse what she did at the sanctuary. I can't return without her. I'm meeting with the High Command in three days. Perhaps, if there's time, I'll discuss this matter with them.
