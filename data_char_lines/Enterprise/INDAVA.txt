(a pretty young woman) I'd like to speak with you. I wanted to ask you about a certain procedure. I'm sorry, it's very difficult for me to talk about. Yes, thank you. [Mess hall] Does D'Jamat know? No, the doctor said he needed time to review our physiology. He's under guard now. It's too late. Have you changed your mind? I won't watch my son or daughter fight in D'Jamat's war. You don't believe that any more than I do. [Ready room]
