(fair haired) Dhk'tr! Siskah tral p'kat. (He adjusts his goggles then raises them, lowering his weapon.) Nahk I'taree. [Campsite] (The fire is blazing.) What are you doing on Dakala? Not exactly. That drayjin you're eating, we killed it yesterday. Don't underestimate the game on this planet. They often get the better of us. No. You wouldn't be the first person who looked into the jungle and saw something that wasn't there. We saw a pack of fire wolves yesterday about six kilometres from here. It's a difficult hike. It could be a plume of steam. They can fool our thermal scanners. Well, thanks to your doctor I don't even have that. We hunt more than wild pigs. Wraiths. You don't even know if it was a she. That's why we were tracking you the day you arrived. We thought they'd taken your form. In recent years, we learned when you corner them they panic, especially the young ones. Are you sure? I'm not picking up a signature. It was probably just a drayjin. Where is it? Well, if it's cornered, it must be terrified. Why can't we detect it? Maybe our scanners aren't working. We need to leave. Our scanners are malfunctioning.
