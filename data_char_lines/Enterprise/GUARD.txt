This way. (They follow through tunnels where various aliens are working.) [Mine Foreman's Office]  They're gone, all three of them. We've searched the entire cell perimeter. They're nearly to the surface. We should destroy their landing pod. I'll see to it. [Plasma duct thirteen] Pick him up. [Mine complex]
Who's that?
I’m sorry sir. I’ve orders to keep you here. The Captain. (There's another jolt, then Archer hits him.) [Bridge]
You have five minutes. You! Get back to work! (Kolos and Archer are hacking at the walls with pickaxes, and Kolos is exhausted.) Our ships run on dilithium, not talk. Get back to work. (They fight and Archer turns the pain stick on the guard, and gets jabbed himself by a second guard.) Anymore trouble from you and you'll spend the night on the surface. Follow me. This way.
I'll be right back. (He gets a rifle from a locker, then heads back into the main passenger area of the ship, where the prisoners are being held under guard, in shackles.)  [Prison transport] Are you Archer? You're being released. A ship's coming to retrieve you. Quiet. I said, quiet. That's enough! Keep still! All of you. (The freed prisoner knocks him out and the other guard out then uses the guard's device to release the Nausicaan, who starts kicking the downed Enolian before throwing his weapon to Kuroda.) You know what happens if he dies. If you get him medical attention, it'll work in your favour. I'll tell the magistrate you showed compassion. (He gets a punishment zap.)  [Prison transport Bridge] If those are patrol ships, you're going to be recaptured.
Thanks, Doctor. Understood. Doctor?
The Captain would like to see you. (Rajiin touches the guard's hand.) I have my orders.
Sir!
Why are you flying a Denobulan shuttle? You aren't Denobulan. (She takes out him and his companion, very viciously.)
