Security to Captain Archer. The aliens are gone, sir. They've launched their shuttle. (Another salvo at a nacelle and the green ship leaves.)
The cloak's not responding, sir. [USS Defiant - Bridge] Engineering to Bridge. The containment fields are failing. Negative. Reactor breach in three minutes.
Aye sir.
Security to Captain Archer. There's weapons fire on G deck, outside the Tellarites' quarters.
We've got a power fluctuation in the starboard nacelle, sir. Aye. sir.
Engineering to the Bridge. We just picked up a surge in the EPS grid on A deck. (Bang! Everyone ducks and rubble lands on the central display console.)
Captain Archer, sir. Admiral Forrest needs you at Starfleet Medical right away. [Starfleet Medical - observation room] Go ahead. Acknowledged. Is someone wounded?
Sorry to disturb you sir, but I have an incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. It's Admiral Forrest. Yes, sir.
Bridge to Captain Archer.
Engineering. Yes, sir.
