You've obviously never been here before. You've never spoken Risan before today?. We're attending the Festival of the Moons tonight. You should go if you have the time.
(doing some welding) Watch your step, ma'am. Travis? Haven't seen you for a while. Did you lock yourself in a cargo container again? It's good to see you. If you're not busy tonight, stop by the Mess.
Thank you, Doctor.
Sir Giacomo, into your armour, and you to your place in the pavilion.
What the hell do you want? Who's asking?
How's your drink? Because I'd heard someplace your people didn't like alcohol. You know, you're right. I get your species mixed up all the time. I'm just trying to make sure your friend here is comfortable. Sitting in a bar full of so many strange looking aliens like us. Because if you weren't, if humans make you nervous for some reason, the Vulcan Consulate's on the other side of the bridge. I'll bet there's someplace there where someone like yourself could get a nice, refreshing beverage. If your friend wants to go, you should let him go. You Starfleet people are the real problem. You fly all around space telling every species you meet where to find Earth. Did it ever occur to you that might not be the smartest thing to do? Excuse me, Admiral. I don't take orders from you.
Board that ship! Take everything you can! (And they do, leading us into opening credits with unfamiliar music, that start the same and then become very different with images of conflict instead of exploration, and a final logo of Earth with a sword through it. Anyone else old enough to recognise it?) Captain's Starlog, January 13, 2155. We've left Gorlan Station and have set a course to rendezvous with our assault fleet. Major Reed and the doctor have asked for a few minutes to show me their latest project. [Agony Booth] (A Tellarite in a Starfleet uniform is suffering.)
We're trying. We can't break through the signal.
