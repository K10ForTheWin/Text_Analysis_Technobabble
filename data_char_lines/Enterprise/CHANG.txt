Do you have any idea where we're headed, Ensign?
No, ma'am. Captain's orders. [Hatchery] (Archer is working on the main life support control unit in the middle of the chamber.) She's not suppose to have any visitors, sir. I'm sorry sir, no visitors. I have new orders from Major Hayes. You'll have to speak with the Major, sir. (We see Reed and Phlox sneaking down the corridor while Chang is distracted.) Step away, sir. (Reed is holding a phase pistol.)
