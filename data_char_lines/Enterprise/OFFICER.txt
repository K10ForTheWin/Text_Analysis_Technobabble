A transport shuttle, no armaments. Commander, disruptor fire near the brig. (The door opens, and the two young men raise their weapons.)
Where is he?
Captain, there's a power surge in their reactor.
Ready.
Rita Hayworth. Veronica Lake. Betty Grable. Americans are good at making movies. They're not so good at fighting. Some day, I will go to Hollywood and I will meet Betty Grable. Maybe you will introduce me, huh? What do you think? You know, in Hollywood movies, Americans always win. Too bad for you, you're not in a movie. (There's a roadside explosion.) Insurgents! (A driver is shot, and the soldier with the officer. Archer keeps down.) Keep driving! Move! Move! (There's a roadside explosion, then gunfire. The insurgents have the upper hand, so Archer kicks the officer, knocks him out, and makes a run for it. One of the gun men shoots him too, but not seriously. He is taken prisoner by a man in a hat, blue suit and red shirt.) [Situation room]
(a young woman) They're near the fifth planet. Another vessel is docked with them. Unknown, but they've taken the rebels aboard. Torpedo launchers fore and aft. Low-yield particle cannons. We can defeat them easily. They're signalling us. They're heading for the ring system. Debris is interfering with sensors. We've lost sensors. Shields are down! They're leaving orbit. Our engines are down. [Hall of Justice]
Both their nacelles are crippled. Three ships approaching. (The Bird of Prey is strafed from all directions.) Earth vessels. We've lost disruptor banks three and four. Not yet Our warp drive is failing. [Bridge] The other ships are going to turn back.
