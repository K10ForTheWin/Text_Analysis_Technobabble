We've regained control of half the colony, but two dozen Vulcans have been wounded and three have been taken hostage. That may happen sooner than you realise. While you were on the surface, we detected three Andorian vessels approaching. They'll be here in less than five hours. This isn't wise. The colony hasn't been secured. Our scanners are more sophisticated than yours. We detected weapons fire coming from the surface. Then your shuttle appeared to make an emergency landing somewhere in the colony. We haven't been able to pinpoint their landing site, but our units on the ground are already searching. The High Command instructed me to take steps to recover Ambassador Soval. Of course. We have more experience in these matters. We won't allow this provocation to continue. Our response will be appropriate. I'll keep you informed, Commander. (Ends transmission.) Commander, I strongly recommend you withdraw to a safe distance. We will not allow the Andorians to land additional troops on Paan Mokar. Any vessel attempting to enter orbit will be fired upon. This is not a Starfleet matter. The Andorians have made it impossible for us to recover Captain Archer. By now, he's most likely a casualty.
