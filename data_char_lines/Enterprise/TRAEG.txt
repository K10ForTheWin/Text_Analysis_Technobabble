A Vulcan. What brings you to Coridan? You're her superior? I don't recognize your species. Never heard of Vulcans taking orders from anyone. She's not my Chancellor. That government is kept in power by the Vulcans. If you're with them, you're on the wrong side. (Traeg pulls a phase pistol from his pocket.) What kind of weapon is this? If you won't tell me (He aims it at T'Pol.) We'll put these to good use. I'm curious about your starship. What can you tell me about it? Your people have a reputation for truthfulness. You wouldn't be lying to me, would you, Vulcan? Now I understand. You're the Captain, aren't you? Whoever you are, you picked the wrong time for a visit. (The group leaves, turning off the light.) Stop! [Bridge] Is this Enterprise? We're holding your Captain and your steward. In exchange for their safe return we want forty of your phase weapons, the same type we found aboard your shuttle. You'll be hailed at this time tomorrow. I'm sure you wouldn't want any harm to come to her. We'll rely on your full compliance.
