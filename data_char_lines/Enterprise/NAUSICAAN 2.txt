Our scans show you have one of our crewmen aboard. I assume you're here to return him. He won't be for long. (a jolt and an alarm sounding) We're involved in a rescue operation. We want our crewman back. We're happy with our relations the way they are. You're facing three of my ships. We are not interested in your proposals. If you think you can convince them to return our crewman, do it quickly. Otherwise we'll be forced to take our chances. [Cargo Module 4] (The Nausicaans break through the door, and the shooting starts again.)
