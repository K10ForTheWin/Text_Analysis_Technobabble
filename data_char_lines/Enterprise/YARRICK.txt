They're emerging, heading back to their ship. Yes. They're just waiting for your signal. I'm sorry Pri'Nam, but are you certain this is the right thing to do? But these people risked their lives to save us. Never, Pri'Nam. [Ready room] My orders are to escort everyone to their quarters. Watch him. [Engineering] A strike here will cut off their supply route. An update on the repairs to your ship. D'Jamat felt you should be kept appraised. It is. Yes. That's between her and me. That's not true. D'Jamat is my spiritual leader. I will follow him to my death. You went to the doctor. You've put us at risk. He told his Captain. I don't think so. Did you have the procedure? It's just as well. I'm not certain it's the right thing to do. We have the ship now. We'll end the war once and for all. I'm just thinking about what's ahead, Pri'Nam. We've just begun this mission and already three people are dead. Shouldn't it? These people are not our enemy. Why? Yes. You can't win. They'll destroy the ship. No. I won't betray my faith. No. We believe the Makers created the Chosen Realm in nine days. They believe it took ten. What is it? Why? Pri'Nam. We've located the problem. It's under repair. The warp reactor should be functioning in a few hours. They're sending a transmission. They want to surrender.
