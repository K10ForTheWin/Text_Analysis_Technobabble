(younger, taller man) Getting him out of here's going to be a delicate operation. An arm. It's his. From what I can tell, it was integrated into his circulatory and nervous systems. He could probably operate it like it was his own flesh and blood. Take a look at the eyepiece. Judging by the optics, I'd say he could see most of the EM spectrum. That's even more interesting. They don't have much in common. They belong to two different species. Right away. I believe you're looking at a form of nanotechnology. I found thousands of these in both aliens. They're not just regenerating the damaged tissue, they're repairing the mechanical components as well. As far as I can tell, this arm's as good as new. Maybe we should move the bodies to Module three, put them back in cold storage with the other samples. That way, we can examine them later under controlled conditions. I guess it's possible. What if it revives more of their systems? We don't know anything about this species or what they were doing here a hundred years ago. They don't exactly look friendly. Thanks. A little on the quiet side. Go ahead. I'll be fine. (Tis fellow researcher leaves, and Moninger pours himself a cup of something hot, then knocks it over as a sound comes from behind him. He checks the monitors. Still flat lines all round. He speaks to the pale corpse with the prosthetic eye.) Feeling better? [Arctic crash site]
