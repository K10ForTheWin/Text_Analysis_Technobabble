I'll see what I can do, Captain. [Colombia Captain's mess]
Seven of the transfer conduits are back on line. The eighth is still giving us some trouble. Came back negative. Already underway. (Kelby walks away.) I'm not sure what you mean, sir. And it's no reflection on me that the Captain wants you to oversee the work. Well, it doesn't look like he's ready to let you go. I'd better get on it. (Kelby leaves as T'Pol arrives.) What are you doing here? It was no problem. Look, I It's the warp reactor. I know. I could show you around. Come on. [Sickbay] The injectors feed into the dilithium chamber. That's right. That's right. Sir? She's only been here a couple of minutes. Well, I guess I can't do anything right. No, sir. I'm not through talking to her. And I'm refusing. You've been on my case since the second you got back. That's what the hell's the matter with me. And I'm telling you, it stops here. So are you, Commander. And what if I don't want to go? I have just as much experience. I'm smarter, younger. We're the only ones who think that. He denies it, but I know he's planning on staying. It isn't. Let's not talk about it anymore. (She moves away from his reach.) What? What are you talking about? He's my superior officer. (D'Nesh gets out of bed.) KELBY: Where are you going? Stay. Wait, don't leave. Forever? Anything. Anything you want. (He gets his reward.) [Engineering] (While Tucker is at the main engine controls, Kelby sneaks in on the upper catwalk and starts messing with a panel. Alarms are triggered.) I didn't do anything. Whatever he told you, it's a lie. He's trying to get rid of me. Don't listen to him! I just want to go back to Engineering. I just want to go back to Engineering.
Commander. Somebody pulled both plasma regulators out of these housings. No, sir, you don't understand. They were here ten minutes ago. I went to get this coupler. When I came back, the regulators were gone. Yes. Yes, sir. (There's a strange noise, so Kelby climbs up into a junction to investigate.) Who's in here? (He finds one of the regulators on the floor, picks it up, then we see him being dragged upwards. Screaming.) [Bridge] (All except Phlox are now in TOS era uniforms. Yes, T'Pol is in a blue mini-skort, and I did spell that correctly. It is a combination mini-skirt and hot pants, for modesty.)
Kelby here. I'm on it, sir. This is it, people. Cycle the ports. Ensign, rig the intakes for cometary debris. Engineering is good to go, sir. [Bridge] Come in. Sabotaged? Yeah. You think I had something to do with it? That's a shuttlepod maintenance log. Commander Tucker took me off that team when he came back from Columbia. Ensign Masaro. [Mess hall]
