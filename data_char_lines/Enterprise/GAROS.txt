Welcome, gentlemen. If I don't have what you're looking for, I'm certain I can find someone who does. Can I help you? Were you looking for something in particular? You won't find a more varied collection in the entire city. This is the pride of my entire collection. (takes a mask off the wall) Draylan, the mythical ruler of the afterworld. (Archer is taking Nor does yours. I see why you have a fondness for masks. Who are you? Earth? I never heard of it. How did you know I was here? I'm an explorer as well. At least, I used to be. I'm from the Malurian system. Two years ago I led a survey mission to study the Akaali. We had no plans to remain here, but after a few months I found myself quite taken with these people, so I decided to stay. There's nothing nefarious about it, I assure you. The reactor powers a fabrication device. It allows me to make food and clothing. I see you've met our apothecary. She's been making baseless accusations against me for months. There's a lethal virus spreading among the Akaali, but it's indigenous. I certainly didn't bring it here. Unfortunately these people don't have the medical technology to cure it, so this woman blames the newcomer, me. Perhaps some other time, Captain. Excuse me. Welcome. If I don't have what you're looking for I'm certain I can find someone who does. Gentlemen. (opens door for them to leave) [Side street] I suggest you leave this system at once or my ship will open fire. That won't be possible. He's dead. My vessel is capable of firing ten of those charges simultaneously. Again, I suggest you break orbit. [Reactor room] I forgot. You're explorers. There are five hundred million Akaali on this planet. A few thousand won't be missed. I'm willing to let you go, provided you promise not to return. We've instructed your ship to send down a launch vehicle to take you and the woman. Believe me, she'll be better off on your ship. Now step away from the control panel, Captain. (Archer gives his phase pistol to Riann.)
