We won't be going to America this time, but always I go with you wherever you go. Understand? You go now, Maria. No, Maria. What I do now, I do alone. I couldn't do it if you were here. If you go, then I go, too. Don't you see how it is? Whichever one there is. I am you now, and you are me. Now you understand and you're going well and fast and far (Tucker realises Phlox has spotted him crying.) Stand up now and go and we both go. Stand up, Maria. Remember, you're me too.
