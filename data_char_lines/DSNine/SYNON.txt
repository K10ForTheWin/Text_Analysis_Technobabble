(Helmswoman) The Dahar Master. Chah Veh! (The cavalry troop leaves DS9.) Yes, tell us! Dahar Master. To the bridge. We're approaching Trelka Five. Are you all right? Chah Veh! Holding at three hundred metres. Aye, sir! (Big BOOM on the bridge. Martok and Worf are out cold. Up steps the third officer.) Coming about! But sir, they have a garrison of ten thousand! I believe it was our Third Officer, General. Perhaps he's confused. I think he's asleep. Perhaps we should ask Kang. (Kor stands up to leave.) Does the Dominion possess such a device? Yes, sir. They're waiting for us in the Kalandra sector, with seven Federation starships. It will take us three hours, forty five minutes to reach them.
