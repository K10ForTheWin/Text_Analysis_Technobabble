You're not just dead, Quark. You're an idiot. I am Gint, the first Grand Nagus. That's because this is a dream, you imbecile. What a clever boy. Always thinking. Don't blame me for your limited imagination. Now, I'll make it simple. You have to break the contract with Brunt. Why not? They're just rules. They're written in a book, not carved in stone. And even if they were in stone, so what? A bunch of us just made them up. Of course they matter. That's why they're a best-seller. But we're talking about your life here. The Rules are nothing but guideposts, suggestions. Would you buy a book called Suggestions of Acquisition? Doesn't quite have the same ring to it, does it? Shh. A brilliant one. Rule of Acquisition two hundred and thirty nine. Never be afraid to mislabel a product. Because I'm telling you to. Exactly. And I wouldn't be here if you didn't want to break the Rules. You just need someone's permission. So I'm giving it to you. I say we kill him right now. He's got a point, Quark. It's a dream. I can't really do anything. But if you want to live, break the contract. It's your only hope. [Quark's bedroom] (Quark wakes to find he's been strangling himself.)
