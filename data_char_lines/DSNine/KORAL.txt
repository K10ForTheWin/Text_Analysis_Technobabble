(a monk) I can't tell you how pleased we are by your visit, Emissary. Oh, there's no need to keep calling me Ranjen. I'm a simple monk. My order is quite informal. It's been a great deal of work, but we do it gladly. Excavating the Holy City is a privilege. Our efforts are an expression of our faith in the Prophets and in the Emissary. Oh, don't let the bats bother you. We're directly below the Temple of B'hala. These walls predate the ancient city by ten thousand years. (They stop in front of the remains of a carving on the wall.) We don't know much about the original inhabitants, but it appears they abandoned this site some twenty five thousand years ago. Over time, sediment buried the ruins. Precisely. In here. [Chamber] (Koral switches on fluorescent tubes at knee height and leads them past a square column to an oval recess carved like the familiar Bajoran symbol.) It's over thirty thousand years old. Neither can we, though we've been able to piece together a few of the translations. The syntax is unusual, but all forms of Bajoran share certain root ideograms. You may recognise this one. Here's where it gets interesting. (Kira comes in for a closer look as well, then looks at Sisko in concern.) I see you recognise it. Now you know why I asked you here. (Sisko reaches to touch the carving and promptly gets taken into a vision.) [Limbo - chamber] The Sisko has come. He is corporeal. It will be the end. You had a vision, Emissary? We saw nothing. Not one that I know of. I wish we could translate them more quickly, but we don't have the resources.
