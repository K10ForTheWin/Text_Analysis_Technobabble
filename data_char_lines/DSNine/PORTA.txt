Nerys. So this is where you are when you're not at the Temple. Very impressive. What business would an old monk have here except maybe helping a young couple to meet the Emissary. Are you sure this is a good time? Your accent is getting much better, Emissary. The Emissary knows that what he's proposing will be difficult for some people to accept.

They do not understand. [Infirmary] The D'jarras are part of what the Sisko would call the past. [Promenade] We can return him to the moment we found him.
