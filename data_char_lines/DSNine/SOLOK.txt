Your welcome is acknowledged. Ten years, two months, five days. Of course I do. But humans are often irked by such precision. Especially the more emotional humans. Our repair list. I understand you were recently honoured with the Christopher Pike Medal for Valour. Congratulations. My second, actually. The T'Kumbra has been in combat for over six months. Spending time behind the lines will be a welcome change. Of course you have. That is most inefficient. A somewhat unprofessional attitude. However, I have come to expect a lack of professionalism and efficiency on starbases run by human officers. Very well. There is another matter not listed on the formal report. I need use of a holosuite. The T'Kumbra holodecks are currently under repair. Then I will speak to Quark. I have created a special programme for my senior staff and they are quite eager to resume using it. Yes. In fact, you may find the programme of some interest. It is based on an Earth game. If you wish. Computer, eliminate the spectators. Umpire, this is completely improper. The game is not over. (Odo turns away, and Solok puts his hand on his shoulder. Pops.) I fail to see why you are celebrating. The Ferengi's bunt was an accident. And you still lost the game. You are attempting to manufacture a triumph where none exists. This is a typical human reaction, based on emotionalism and illogic. Certainly not. I refuse to engage in this human game of taunting.
