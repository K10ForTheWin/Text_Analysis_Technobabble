(female security) Would you come with me, please. [Bashir's quarters] Would you please come with me, Doctor? To the wardroom. Director Sloan wants to ask you a few questions. Nothing you need to worry about, sir. This way. [Wardroom] Doctor Bashir, sir. Director Sloan wants to see you. We have our orders, sir. In his quarters. We'll be handling security for the time being. I believe that, but yours were Jem'Hadar. (Chandler takes Bashir's comm. badge) You won't be needing this anymore. Step inside. (After the break.) With all due respect Captain, if you would just wait in the Security office, Director Sloan should be here any minute and you can discuss your request with him Very well. (Chandler leaves.)
