If I didn't know you better, commander, I'd think you were just making excuses Of course not but with two kidnappings and a ship being destroyed all in less than a week's time obviously your security measures leave something to be desired Then what were they doing when all this was happening? We here at Starfleet are watching how you resolve this situation very closely, commander. We think it might be prudent to replace this chief of security you have Still, it would be a concrete example that you are taking active measures to resolve this situation and to make sure it doesn't happen again. That may be a mistake, Commander Then let me make my point again. Starfleet is very unhappy this has happened. We want this matter taken care of immediately. I don't have to remind you how this reflects on your position Don't bother me with details. Just clean up the mess, Commander. And quickly. Before this becomes a permanent stain on your record. Do I make myself clear?
