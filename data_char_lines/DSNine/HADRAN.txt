I am the Exarch of Nehelik Province. You will transport Croden to this location. Your communication clearly stated that he was in your custody. We are well aware of the traffic through the newly discovered passage. We simply have no interest in contact with anyone from your quadrant. Croden is an enemy of the Rakhari people. We request that he be returned immediately. Tried? Croden has already been declared guilty in absentia for myriad crimes on this world. That judgement supersedes your charges. Return him, and I can assure you his punishment will be appropriate to your crime as well as ours. I do not know what kind of people you are. I do not care to know. But if your society purports to respect the rules of our society, you will return him without delay.
