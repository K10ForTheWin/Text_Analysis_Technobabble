(a Cardassian) Quark, you parasite. It's been too long. Is Hartla still working for you? Oh, what I wouldn't give to see her again. I'll bet she does. She would've bankrupted me if the occupation would've lasted much longer. But I'm sure you didn't contact me just to reminisce. What can I do for you? You have my undivided attention. Bio-technology. That shouldn't be too difficult. What is it? Give it to me. I'll look for it. Hold on. [Quark's] This won't take long. Quark, you idiot! Is something wrong? I'm ruined. My career is over. You and your damn requisition code. It's for classified bio-technology, Quark. Even the cursed number is classified. Where did you get it? No. Don't tell me. I don't want to know. If I'm lucky, I can still get through this with my skin intact. Maybe they won't trace the request back to me. The Obsidian Order.
