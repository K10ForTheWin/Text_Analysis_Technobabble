Stop. What are you doing here? Let me see that. (Some Klingons on the Promenade search Morn's bag.) Two bottles of So far away from the Hyundite nebula. So what is it that you do on this station? Lohd Zoss-lee chaw-KU sohk jaTAL? I don't take orders from shape-shifters, or their Cardassian lapdogs. As long as you wear that Bajoran uniform, we're allies. Make sure you never take it off. Guess again. (And five Klingons honourably beat up one Cardassian.) [Infirmary] Bloodwine! And hurry! (Morn makes a discreet exit.) This bloodwine is cold! Get me another one! That's right.
