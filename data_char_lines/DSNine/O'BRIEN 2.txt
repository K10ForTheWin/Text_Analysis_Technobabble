Quark, this happens every time the Klingons come aboard the station. Why don't you just keep them out of the holosuites? Look out! (O'Brien dodges a flying chair) [Commander's office] Come on, come on! Hurry up! We don't have much time! Prepare to seal the hatch and release the docking clamps. Initiating emergency escape protocol. Hang on. I'm going to full impulse. (DS9 has lots of explosions happening.) You're here! Look, I don't know what happened. I was asleep in bed, and the whole station was rocked by an explosion. Before I could get to Ops, the evacuation alarm sounded and the comm. systems were down. I got as many people as I could in here. I don't know what happened to the others. When you go back, you have to find out what happened and stop it. (DS9 goes KaBOOM! The wormhole WHOOSHes and implodes in white light.) What? Computer, lights. Oh no, not you again. What is it now? Destroyed? How? You look pretty bad. But if you feel bad and you're my past self, shouldn't I feel bad too? (Shouldn't you also know that he was going to be here and what he saw earlier/later?) They've hit the fusion reactor. Main power's down. Defence systems are offline. (Our O'Brien collapses in agony.) Miles, you've got your answer. The quantum singularity that's been orbiting the station. It's the Romulans. Are you listening? The Romulans use a confined singularity to power their warp core. That's what we've been detecting. That's what's causing the time shifts. You must go back and tell them to put up the shields and stand by for an attack. Me? I don't belong there. It worked. O'Brien to Sisko. [Ops] I've been to the future, Commander. The quantum singularity off the station is actually in the warp core of a cloaked [Ops] There's been a change. [Wardroom]
