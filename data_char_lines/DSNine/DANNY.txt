Dad. One of the guards got into a fight with a dim down at Processing. Everyone's going crazy. I have got to find my dad. [Outside the Processing Centre] (Firebombs are being thrown, people are lying injured in the street. Three people beat up Bernardo for his gun.)
Dad. They're fine. They're with the Petersons. I wanted to be with you. I want to be here with you.
