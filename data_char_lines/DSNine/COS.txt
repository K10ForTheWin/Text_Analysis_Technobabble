If only I could be so fortunate. Please accept my apologies. I didn't mean to disturb you, but as you can see, my health is not so good. I wasn't always like this. I had youth, vigour, fame, wealth beyond measure. All gone. All because of this. (A purple sphere with flashing lights.) Of course not. In a manner of speaking. Every trade deal I struck was a disaster. Every alliance I formed fell apart. Every endeavour backed, a failure. Yes. Rotten luck. In the end It all comes down to luck. (plays the game again) I won!
