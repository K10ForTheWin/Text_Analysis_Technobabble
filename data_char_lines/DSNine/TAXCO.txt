(alien red-head) Madam Ambassador. Then move me to the crew level. Then someone can move. You, for example. At least I didn't bother the Captain every hour with some new suggestion on how to run his ship. Are you actually suggesting we indulge in one of those disgusting Ferengi sex programmes? Why, this is outrageous. A first-year officer assigned as our liaison. Starfleet command will hear of this. He refuses to change my accommodations. If I have to sleep another night on a Cardassian bed with gargoyles staring at me from the woodpoles Is it just the lights or the heat too? I didn't bring any warm clothes. Please, Julian. Call me Taxco.
