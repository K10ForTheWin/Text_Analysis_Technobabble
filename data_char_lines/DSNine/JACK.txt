Can you hear me? Hello? Calling Doctor Bashir. Hello? Anybody there? Hello? Hello? Doctor Bashir?
That's Admiral Patrick. We're mutants. Why are you so upset? You wanted Sarina brought here. Well, here she is! (Sarina is sitting quietly on a biobed.) Well don't worry, we'll help you. And when we're through with Sarina, she will be just like us. We didn't get caught, did we? Of course. But when they did, Patrick would say Of course she remembers you. She's not an idiot. Why are we doing this, anyway? Here? Oh, what difference does it make? Fine. (kicks it.) How's that? Well, well? What did the Captain say? See? See? I told you it was a good idea to bring her here. So, when do we operate? You're going to need some help. How hard can it be? Oh, I get it. You want to take all the credit. Fine. I'm busy anyway. New project. Wouldn't you like to know? Your friend was right. You can't break the laws of physics. (They've augmented the medical probe with a tricorder fastened to it and lots of wires.) We recalibrated the imaging diodes. It is so accurate that you could clip the wings of an angel dancing on the head of a pin. If you wanted to. [Surgery] (Sarina lying on the operating table with the probe behind her. She's put to sleep. We see Bashir operating with red and green lights going into Sarina's head. Later, it's all finished and she's lying on a biobed, eyes wide open. The group are waiting in the cargo bay.) Maybe I did. Maybe I didn't. It was my idea to bring you here. Aren't you going to thank me? Why are you talking like that? (mimics) There's so much I want to say to all of you. There's so much I want to say to all of you. Practice! Ah, practice. Good idea. Listen to this, Sarina. (sings a sol-fa scale) Do ray mi fa so la ti do. Are you tone deaf? Do ray mi fa so la ti. Let's improvise. Lauren. Do ray me do ray me. Fa me ray do. (Bashir applauds.) Molto allegro. (And the group moves on into four part harmony and I give up trying to transcribe it.) [Quark's] The fact is that the universe is going to stop expanding and it is going to collapse in on itself. We've got to do something before it's too late. Sixty trillion years, seventy at the most. What are you doing? We are running out of time! (Sarina enters.) Sarina, thank God! Nobody else around here ever listens to me. There's too much matter. The universe is too heavy for its own good. Yes, yes, yes, exactly. We have to find some way to decrease the mass. That's the whole point. Change the cosmological constant. You know something, Sarina? We are trying to save existence as we know it, and all you can do is criticise! Thank you. Now, where were we? Right. Right. (Later, Bashir arrives as promised to discover Sarina sitting staring at nothing. The display title is now How To Avert Disaster...) Doctor! Glad you're here. Sarina, are you all right? She's fine. Listen, you have to talk to Starfleet for us. We need subspace field generators, lots of them. Later? There isn't going to be a later, later. (goes back to work) Now, once we get the field generators When should we be ready? Figures. You have no right to do this. No right! We did not help you so you could take her away from us! Why? Because we're not normal? Because we're crazy? Oh, who wants to be normal anyway? We're better than they are. You don't see any of them trying to save the universe from collapsing, do you? Let's get back to work. [Promenade] Why should we help you? You just want to steal her away from us. Are you sure? Why? This way we can all stay together. (Lauren gets the door open.) This way. Tell him. But we think it has something to do with you.
