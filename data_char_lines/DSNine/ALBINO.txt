Report. Cancel those orders. Move all guards to the inner defence line. Make sure the power station is secure. Not functioning? Use long range sensors to check for interference from a cloaked ship in orbit. In the meantime, have the guards fix kuttars to their rifles and prepare for hand-to-hand combat. (the power goes off) [Compound] (Dax joins Kang, Koloth and Kor) [Command post] They must have already broken through the inner defence line. Move the perimeter guards into the house. Then get out there and tell them yourself. I don't want that Klingon filth to get in this (Boom! The doors are blown in and the magnificent four are there) (using the guard as a shield) Get them! (The Albino lets his guards do all the fighting and dying. Then Koloth is wounded) You'll die far quicker than your son did, Kang. (Finally the two old enemies go head to head. Dax finishes off the last guard as Kang breaks his bat'leth against a railing. The Albino stabs him in the stomach.) No vengeance today, Kang. (Dax knocks the weapon out of the Albino's hand) And who are you, girl? The Trill. Of course. You're far too young and lovely to sport such a deadly weapon. All right, then. (The Albino puts his neck in the curve of the blade) Use it, if that's what you came to do. Kill me in cold blood. Run me through the belly and cut out my heart. Isn't that what your blood oath promised? Or have you lost your appetite, my dear. (Kang stabs the laughing Albino in the back)
