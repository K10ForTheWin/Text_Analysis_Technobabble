Rodek? Can you hear me? Rodek! On a Federation space station. Our shuttle was damaged. You were hit by a plasma discharge. Your name is Rodek. You are my son. You're part of the House of Noggra, a small but proud family. So don't worry. I will teach you all that you have forgotten when we get home.
