Why? I didn't do anything wrong! I didn't do anything wrong. What're they going to do with me? I want to go home. No, I mean home. To Bajor. Why? That's not my fault. I was born that way. Yes, there is. It's the truth. Everybody knows it. They hate them. They hate other Cardassians, not me. My parents have never done anything wrong to me. Not me. My parents follow the teachings of the Prophets. What do you think of Cardassians? Why not? Do you know how many Bajorans the Cardassians murdered during the occupation? Over ten million. We had a test on it in school. I wish I wasn't Cardassian. [Bashir's quarters] (Julian is having a restless night when his door opens) No. No. It was your own fault. You deserved it. You are Cardassian. What the Bajorans did, they had to do. You can't understand. You are a Cardassian butcher! A butcher. They killed your son for your crimes. You are not my father! And I will never go back to Cardassia. Never. [Commander's office] No. No. My father teaching me how to swim. [Infirmary] (Garak is keeping out of view)
