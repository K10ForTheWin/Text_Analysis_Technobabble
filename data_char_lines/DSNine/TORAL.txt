Well, Kor, it seems you were right. You did find the Sword. Ask your friend. It is good to see you too, Worf. Seems you were too drunk to remember me or the tavern on Torna Four? You held us all spellbound with a tale of a Hur'q cloth and how it was going to lead you to the Sword. I was so intrigued that I sent my friend here to see what else you knew. (It's the Lethean.) What we all want. The Sword. Who will be so grateful he'll give Kor his statue and perhaps even forgive your dishonour? I'm afraid I have different plans for the Sword. I'm not giving the Emperor anything. With the Sword in my hand, I'll be leading the Empire! I can see from your face, Worf, that you regret having spared my life. Now give it to me. Then I'm afraid we'll have to take it.
