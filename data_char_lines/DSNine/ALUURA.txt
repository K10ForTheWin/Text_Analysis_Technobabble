I take my job very seriously. That's because I like my work. I'm happy to be here. I try to be. You mean I've offended someone? But I'm always nice to you. How much nicer? (Quark hands her a PADD.) Oo-mox for Fun and Profit? Oh. You want me to be nice. You wouldn't. Would you? Quark? I read the book. You know, Oo-mox for Fun and But you told me to. Really? That's too bad. No, it's not that. It's just that Oo-mox sounded like fun. The tympanic tickle, the eustachian tube rub, the auditory nerve nibble. But if that's the way you feel about it.
