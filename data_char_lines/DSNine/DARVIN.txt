The pleasure is all mine. You wouldn't dare put one of the greatest heroes of the Klingon Empire into the brig. I will be. I've been thinking about my statue in the Hall of Warriors. I want it to capture my essence. Our statues can be so generic sometimes, don't you think? I see myself standing with Kirk's head in one hand and a tribble in the other. Nothing so mundane. Let's just say that Kirk's death will have a certain poetic justice to it. [Enterprise corridor]
