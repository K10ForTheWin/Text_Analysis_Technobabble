I, Kornan son of Shovak, weapons officer of the ship Rotarran, present the glorious record of our honour and hope that you may find us worthy of your leadership. (He hands over a PADD.) Three barrels? [Klingon Ready room] (Dirty, uncared-for room like the rest of the ship and crew) And we were still denied a victory. It won't last. This ship is made for tears, not laughter. Make your jokes. Hold off fate for another day if you can, but this ship and all the souls within its hull are cursed. Death and dishonour walk these corridors like members of the crew. Tell me you don't believe it too. (The lights dim.) Now you will see. Either death or dishonour will visit us this day and there will be nothing that you or I or any of us can do about it. [Klingon Bridge] Torpedo bays are loaded, warheads are armed. Disruptors are locked on target. Martok must die. Shields and weapons ready.
