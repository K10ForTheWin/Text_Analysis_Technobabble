I don't remember seeing you before. And I bet I know what you're thinking. You'd like nothing better than to get us all drunk so you could kill us in our sleep. Come. Sit on my lap and tell me how much you hate Cardassians. You Bajoran women, you're all so bony. You know, I could have you executed for that kind of insolence. Clever girl. Now pour me some more of that kanar and let's see if we can't work out our differences. (Dukat enters with Basso and sees the Gul pawing Meru in a recess.) (sotto) I only hope you won't condemn us all for the boorish behaviour of one man. Let's just say this is not the first performance I've seen of this little melodrama. That woman should consider herself fortunate. She's caught the Prefect's eye. As of now, she's off limits to the rest of us. As for you Don't tell me what to do. I'll put my feet wherever I want. I'm a Cardassian. I'm not going home. I'm coming in with you. I want comfort and I want it now. You are a comfort woman, aren't you? You're dressed like one. That mouth of yours is going to get you in trouble someday. Now, let's go get some sleep. Tomorrow you'll be all mine to do with as I please. (He totters away.)
