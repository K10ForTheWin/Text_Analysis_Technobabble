Another equipment failure? Perhaps if you hadn't dismissed Mister Lorkin, this wouldn't have happened. Then we'll have to find a way of changing her mind, won't we. Who's your new mechanic, Janel? That wouldn't be Chief O'Brien, would it? I have several friends in the New Sydney Police. I heard they recently rescued a Starfleet Chief named O'Brien from an unpleasant situation. Thadial Bokar. I'm a commodities broker, attempting to establish business ties with the illustrious Tigan family. We'll argue about that later. We have more immediate concerns. O'Brien is with Starfleet Intelligence. That may be what he wants you to think. But why was he on New Sydney trying to infiltrate the Syndicate? Some woman. Do you know the name of this woman? Well I do. Her name was Morica Bilby. Now, of course, I haven't heard from Morica Bilby in quite some time. Tumour has it that she's dead, but I wouldn't know anything about that. What I do know is that Chief O'Brien should leave this system, quickly, before something happens to him. [Tigan living room]
