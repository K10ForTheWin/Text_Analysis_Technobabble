What problem? We don't have a long time. (Croden enters, with a weapon) Whoever you are, you're making a mistake. He's dead. My brother. (Odo knocks Ah-Kel down then security arrives) Have you known any twinned Miradorn, Commander? In my species, we are not just twin brothers. Together we are a single self, two halves of one being. I am incomplete now. You have no proof My brother and I purchased it from a passing Altoran trader. I am the one whose brother was killed, Commander. I want to deal with the one who killed my twin. My only purpose in life from here on is to see him dead. (Ah-Kel leaves) Understand me, shape-shifter. He killed the part of me that made existence bearable. I cannot stop until I kill him. Get in there! Where is he, Quark? You're lying. He's gone. You're hiding him. You've been in this together all along. You're as responsible for my brother's death as he is. Why should I believe you? Tell me where Croden is, or you can die in his place. The coordinates are very clearly stated right here in the log entry. One more thing, little Ferengi. You better be telling the truth or I'll be back to finish this. (Ah-Kel leaves) The first shot was a warning. You will surrender the Rakhari prisoner to me. Very well. Then you can die with him. (BOOM) Are you prepared to surrender your prisoner? There will barely be a trace of your little vessel when we are finished with you.
