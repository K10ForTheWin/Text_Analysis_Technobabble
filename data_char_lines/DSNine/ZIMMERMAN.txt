What were your initial impressions of Doctor Bashir? Good and bad. You mean he was difficult. Could you elaborate on that? Are you implying that he harassed you with unwanted advances? I see. Could you be more specific? (Morn shrugs.) You're not being very helpful. You can rest assured that I will keep anything you say in the strictest confidence. You have my word. Positive.
