Alpha Quadrant? I saw a small ship disappear. I followed it How long does it last, this anomaly? No. No time. I will not abandon my vessel. I will not leave! Why? Yes. The coladrium flow has been damaged. (O'Brien bumps his head) Can it be repaired? Depends? On my world, it would be simple. With proper materials I could do it myself. I have no time! Oh. Brien. I am Tosk. I am Tosk. The passage through the anomaly was very rough. You wear a weapon? I understand. A health centre? How many live here? What is its purpose? Defence? Surveillance? Many ships dock here? Others will detect ships from your quadrant as I did and follow them here. I am Tosk. I wish to begin work on my ship. I require only seventeen minutes of sleep per rotation. Hungry? Liquid nutrients are stored in plasmic fibres throughout my body. Oh Brien. Thank you. Computer. May I see a display of this facility? Interior. Show me where the weapons are stored. No. The coladrium flows through the arva nodes. For fuel replenishment. Fuel? Ramscoop? Yes! The arva nodes convert space matter into fuel. Piece of cake. Ramscoop. Arva nodes. They will be easy to fix? Piece of cake. (They climb back into the cockpit) How long? No. No time for that. I would not blame you. I cannot tell, O'Brien. Nothing like this exists on my world. What is R and R? You sleep a full third of your rotation. You rest and relax while you are awake. Alpha quadrant has far too much down time. We are very different, Tosk and O'Brien. I am sorry. I have no vices for you to exploit. Holosuite? I have no use for fantasy adventure. I live the greatest adventure one could ever desire. I cannot discuss it. I did nothing to you. I must prepare. I cannot discuss it. I am Tosk. O'Brien? I will not fight you. I cannot discuss it. I did nothing to you. (Bounces off the forcefield) Wanted? Never. I am Tosk. It is all I can say. O'Brien, you must let me out. Allow me to die with honour. Allow me to die with honour. [Security office] I told them nothing. A way out? Of here? Asylum? O'Brien, I am Tosk. I cannot hide here behind the protection of your Federation. It is against everything I believe. To stay would be a greater dishonour. I am Tosk, the hunted. I live to outwit the hunters for another day. To survive until I die with honour. But that will not be my fate. But I will not deny my existence as Tosk. Thank you, O'Brien, but I cannot request asylum. [Quark's] Now you are Tosk as well, O'Brien. (They crawl on) The hunt goes on. You wish to come? Will your Federation punish you for helping me? O'Brien. Die with honour, O'Brien.
