I wouldn't mind hearing a little more. I'm twenty two. Thanks. I'm just glad to be here. Well, there is one thing. Next time you two go to the holosuite, I'd like to come along. I suppose. Have you ever gone to the holosuite with them? To the class of seventy two. Another round? Time to go? Okay. I never had real Saurian brandy before. It's Captain Sisko's favourite. Speaking of sneaking up on you. Here we are. Home sweet home. [Ilario's quarters] I'm fine. I'm fine. I wish they could have been there. (A picture of him and his classmates, laughing.) They would have loved it. See me fly the Defiant into battle. It was incredible. You know something, Lieutenant? You're very beautiful. True enough. But in the morning, I'll be sober and you'll still be beautiful. Good night, Lieutenant. [Ezri's bedroom] You tell me, Counsellor. Don't tell me, tell him.
