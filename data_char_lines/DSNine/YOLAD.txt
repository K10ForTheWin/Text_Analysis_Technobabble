Yes, can I help you? What would a Starfleet officer want with me? I am. Why? Of course I did. He was my brother. That's right. We both graduated from the same music academy. That doesn't make any sense. What's all this about? My brother died eighty five years ago. I have a hard time remembering what happened yesterday. No, but that doesn't mean Joran didn't know him. You said he was joined? They could've met when my brother went off to become an Initiate. That's what I just said, isn't it? Not according to the Symbiosis Commission. They claim he was dropped from the programme after the second year. According to them he murdered the doctor that recommended dropping him, and was killed trying to escape the murder scene. Oh, I believe he killed that doctor. My brother had a violent temper. But about six months before that happened my brother contacted me. He sounded different somehow, more confident, even colder than usual. And when I asked him about it he laughed. He said me he was different, that he'd been Joined. Maybe he did. I was so surprised to learn he'd been chosen to be Joined I can't remember much else. I loved my brother, Commander. In spite of all the things he did, I loved him.
