Stop there. Nearby. I've changed my appearance since we last saw each other. I don't want you to see me. Is this about the tailor's shop? I didn't do it. Very good, Odo. I see working for the Bajorans hasn't entirely dulled your instincts. You'd have to ask the Romulans. But I do know that you are investigating a very insignificant piece of a much larger puzzle. There's been a great deal of unusual Romulan activity these past weeks. Cloaked ships believed to be warbirds have been detected near the Cardassian border. Troop movements. Communication activity. It has occurred to us. And we're ready for it if it should happen. But it doesn't make any sense. Still the wry observer of humanoid folly. Tell me, do you still do the Cardassian neck trick? Pity. You were so good at it. Garak isn't the only former operative in the Order who had an unfortunate incident yesterday. But he's the luckiest. The other five didn't survive. Killed? No. Three died from natural causes. The other two perished in accidents. If you believe in coincidence. There were certain indications of their involvement. Here. (The Cardassian throws down a PADD.) Those are the names of the five dead operatives. I suggest you show that to Garak then ask him that question. I trust you'll agree that this information satisfies my debt to you. However, if you do learn something from your tailor and wish to share it with me, I would be indebted to you again.
