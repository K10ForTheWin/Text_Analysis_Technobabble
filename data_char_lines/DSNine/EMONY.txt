This is an excellent body you've managed to get for me. I remember when I first got the Dax symbiont, I was worried that it might affect my coordination in some way. As it turned out, being joined improved my concentration. You're a gymnast? Ah. Did you take it up before or after you were joined? Why am I not surprised?
