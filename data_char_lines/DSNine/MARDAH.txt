You aren't leaving? Come on. Aren't you feeling lucky? Karjinko. Sorry. (Mardah leaves the wheel.) Busy. (Mardah takes a glass from a tray and goes to sit with Jake.) Who, me? The first rule of dabo is watch the wheel So, what's on the menu tomorrow night? Tomorrow night? Dinner with your father? He didn't tell you? He came by this afternoon and invited me to dinner tomorrow night. In fact, he said it was your idea. It is all right, isn't it? I mean, you don't mind, do you? Smells good. What is it? What do you want to know? There isn't much to tell. It's a pretty familiar story. Parents killed during the occupation, raised by my neighbours until I was thirteen, then I moved out on my own. I have a sister and a brother on Bajor, but we haven't talked in years. Sarjeno and Koran were not exactly thrilled when I told them I had a job as a dabo girl. Then I told them what I thought of their lives and we stopped speaking. It's amazing how some people will judge you based on nothing more than your job. Jake, they aren't that good. Nothing like your poetry. Now who doesn't have enough faith in themselves? He writes some of the most beautiful things I've ever read. That's what won me over. And the way he plays dom-jot. Oh, your son can play. He's quite the hustler. Jake seemed like just another teenage boy at first, but there's more to him than that. I care about him very much.
