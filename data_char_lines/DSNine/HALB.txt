(serving the coloured water) So tell me, how's work going on the ore processing centre? All in good time. Once the centre is up and running, we'll all be slaving away down there. (Kira goes to a table and Halb follows her.) I have news for you. I know why you haven't heard from her in the last few weeks. She hasn't been on the station. Word has it she's been off on a little vacation with Gul Dukat. They just got back today. Why is that woman so important to you? She is nothing but a collaborator. She's a comfort woman for the spoonheads, isn't she? For a day. But I've been watching you. You have no love for the spoonheads. I will, I promise. But first I need for you to draw a map for me. The Cardy side of the station. Anything you remember will help. Quarters, corridors, meeting rooms. It doesn't concern you. Now are you going to help us or not? It's composed of ultritium resin (it's an earring) which means it's doubtful the Cardassian sensors will pick it up. Of course, there's always a chance. You sound like you've done this before. Remember, the bomb is set to go off three minutes after it's been activated. And once it's activated, it cannot be disarmed. So make sure you have enough time to get away. Twenty metres. I suggest you plant it somewhere in Dukat's quarters. What about that Bajoran mistress of his? You cannot risk telling her what you're doing, not even to save her life.
