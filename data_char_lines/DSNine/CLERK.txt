The Assay office is the most secure area on the station. The chambers are surrounded on all sides by individual force fields. Once you secure a chamber, it can't be opened except with your personal authorization code combined with a verified retinal print. MK-twelve, with an L-ninety enhanced resolution filter. Computer, begin inventory for cubicle nineteen. One statue, stone, thirty odd centimetres tall, approximately eight kilograms. Assorted gems. Gold necklace. One dagger, bronze and gold, about twenty five centimetres. (Vash opens a box to reveal a large orange crystal with an inner light) Beautiful. I've never seen anything quite like it. Some kind of Promethean quartz. Remarkable. End inventory. Please, enter an access code. (Vash taps in some digits then does her retina scan. The drawer shuts.)
