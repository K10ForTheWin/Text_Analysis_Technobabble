Legate Damar, please report to your quarters.
Look to the children. They are the future of Cardassia and they will lead the way. Invest in their minds. Teach them carefully. [Processing area] (O'Brien is pushed into a spotlight.)
Begin.
Combat stations. Enemy ship approaching. (It's the Defiant on Weyoun's monitor.)
Yes, sir.
This is Cardassian navigational control post twenty four. Identify yourself. According to our scan, your subspace field emitters appear to be malfunctioning. Do you require assistance? We can dispatch a repair ship. Are you certain? Your power signature is still fluctuating. Understood. You can put in for repairs after you deliver your cargo.
All prisoners return to your quarters. (Sisko is pulled to his feet.) All bio-organic materials must be disposed of according to regulations. [Surgery] All recreation passes are suspended for alpha unit personnel until further notice. Secure all exits on floor alpha.
