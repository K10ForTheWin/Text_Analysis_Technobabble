We are the Skrreea. My people need your help. There's no time to waste. (to Kira) They're on the creshnee side of the Eye. The Eye of the Universe. The tunnel. They're on the other side. They don't realise we found the Eye. Many. Three jeetaka. Three million. Three million of my people are on the other side. We must bring them through the Eye. We must bring them here. [Ops] I'm just not used to the men being here. Skrreean men don't involve themselves in situations like this. Yes. Men are much too emotional to be leaders. They're always fighting among themselves. It's their favourite thing to do. I'm sorry. I hope I haven't offended anyone. (Sisko enters from his office) Please do not misunderstand. We love our men. Really. Me? Oh, no. I'm little more than a farmer. I was just lucky. I was the first one to find the Eye of the Universe. We had heard about a great tunnel being discovered. We knew it must be the Eye of the Universe that would lead us to Kentanna. Kentanna is the legendary home of the Skrreeans. It has always been portrayed in our sacred texts as being just beyond the Eye of the Universe. A planet of sorrow where the Skrreean will sow seeds of joy. That will be difficult. They're spread out, looking for the Eye. I understand. Most of our leaders were killed by the T-Rogorans. For eight centuries my people have lived under their rule. We've been forced to work as labourers and servants. We were able to escape when the T-Rogorans were invaded and conquered. I don't know their name. I only know they were members of something called the Dominion. [Guest quarters] That's all right. Please, come in. Computer, lights on full. No. You've been so kind to me, how could I possibly refuse your company? (Gai and Cowl enter, bleary-eyed) Go back to bed. Go on. Go on. I'll join you again after I'm through. Hus-bands? I'm not familiar with that word. They're bonded to me. Of course. Don't you sleep with your males? They're very useful. Why me? Yes, that's true, but Kira, I'm just a farmer. I'm sorry. I think you misunderstood. I thought this was the most hideous thing I'd ever seen. It's awful. Come along. Don't be afraid. Come on. It's all right, you're among friends. Don't be afraid. It's all right. It's all right. [Promenade - upper level] (Even more crowds milling around on the Promenade, gawping at the place, children running. Odo and Sisko watch from above.) I'll do the best I can. (The four women leave and Kira comes over.) Look at them. Look at my people. I've never seen them so happy. And here I sit, feeling trapped. They expect me to lead them to Kentanna. Tumak, where have you been? Where are you going? Computer, please show me a chart of this star system. [Promenade - upper level] Of course. (Sisko, Kira and Dax enter) Forgive them, Commander Sisko. They don't mean any disrespect. We appreciate all your hard work, but I'm afraid it was unnecessary. You see, we've found Kentanna. A planet of sorrow, Kira. Don't you see? Kentanna is your planet. Kentanna is Bajor. Station log, stardate 47391.2. Chief O'Brien is continuing to oversee repairs to the Skrreean ships docked at the station. Meanwhile, Minister Rozahn and Vedek Sorad have arrived from Bajor with an official response to the Skrreeans' request to immigrate. [Promenade] But no one is asking you to take care of us. But Bajor has more than enough room for us. The plains of the northwest peninsula are practically uninhabited. The land's ideal for farming. Minister Rozahn, the Skrreeans are farmers. Just give us the land. I guarantee you we can make it thrive again. We're willing to take that risk. No! Projections can be wrong. I thought I made that clear. We are not expecting your help. (to Kira) Please, talk to them. Tell them they're wrong. Help us. Come in. The thing I don't understand is why you pretended to be my friend. Ah. So you are my friend until I need you. I think I've had quite enough of your help. You betrayed me, Kira. If that's true, we have nothing more to discuss. So in other words, you came here looking for forgiveness. Well, I don't forgive you. Tumak? Listen to me. Your ship's in danger. Tumak, turn off your engines. You must turn off your engines now. Tumak, this is serious. Your life is in danger. The others who are with you, their lives are in danger. Please, answer me! Tumak, please, turn your engines off! (weapons fire) Tumak, don't do this! No! You still believe we would have been a burden to your people? I think you've made a terrible mistake. All of you. Maybe we could have helped you. Maybe we could have helped each other. The Skrreeans are farmers, Kira. You have a famine on your planet. Perhaps we could have made that peninsula bloom again. We'll never know, will we? Fifty years of Cardassian rule has made you all frightened and suspicious. I feel sorry for you. You were right. Bajor is not Kentanna. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.
