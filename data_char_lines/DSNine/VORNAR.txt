Everything seems to be in order. But you'll have to leave your weapons here. New orders from Dominion Headquarters. No armed Cardassians allowed aboard Jem'Hadar vessels. So it would seem. I'm sorry, but those are the orders. Take them to the bridge. (Damar is last to hand over his rifle. The Jem'Hadar has gone ahead of Rusot and Kira.) Good luck, Legate Damar. [Jem'Hadar corridor] (Kira releases her handcuffs and drops them on the floor. They morph into goo and slide through the grating.) [Jem'Hadar bridge]
