Eight years. Eight long years. You don't keep extra weight on where I've been. I'm not going to the Gamma Quadrant. My business is right here. With you. That's right. I've come to kill you, Quark. [Commander's office] I didn't order dinner. Old debts. [Klingon restaurant] Have I done something wrong? We do? Kill him? Did he tell you I was going to do that? Let bygones be bygones, I always say. How do I walk? Must be the memory of those Romulan bricks I carried for eight years. But you can't lock a man up for the way he walks, can you? [Promenade] No one can hear you, Quark. It's just you and me. I already have. I'm tired of your gifts, Quark. All I want is your miserable life. How's that? It's a start. [Infirmary] (Another treatment for Melora) Not quite. (Kot has pulled a phaser) I'll be taking them too. Pick it up. Pick it up! Move! Hurry up! Move! Move. Let's go. [Security office] Both of you, back into the ship. Let's go! Move it! Come on, move it. [Runabout Orinoco] Now get us out of here. In the front where I can see you. There. Hurry up. Open the channel to that Commander of yours. Release this ship or I'll kill a hostage. Through the wormhole. (WHOOSH, WHOOSH) What was that? What was it? Take us to warp. I don't care about the course. Just go to warp Get the phasers ready. You'll do it or you'll die. It's your choice. Just sit down and do what I told you. Now! (Dax sees Melora inching her way along the floor, and sits down) Then we'll all die.
