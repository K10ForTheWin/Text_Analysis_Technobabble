That's what you said about Vener Seven. We almost got killed. It's a normal risk when we work for you, that's for certain. So, when do we meet this Kobliad? All right then, a better question. When do we get paid? Not acceptable. We'll require an advance payment of seventy percent. (Kajada is eavesdropping from the top floor) All past debts have been settled. A profit monger. How did you get your hands on a Federation runabout, Quark? When do we meet this employer? It's safe. (Possessed Bashir beams in) Done. Aye. (Bang) The station has locked a tractor beam on us. Well, they're not. They're hailing us. We're not going anywhere with a tractor beam on us. Full impulse engaged. The tractor beam is holding. We can't just sit here and wait. What do you intend to do?
