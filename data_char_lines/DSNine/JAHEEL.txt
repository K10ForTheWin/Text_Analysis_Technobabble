Mister O'Brien. Mister O'Brien. But I've already been waiting two days for your people to readjust my ship's antimatter flow converter. I'm not interested in hearing excuses. I have a shipment of Tamen Sasheer waiting to be delivered to Largo Five, and I'll need to do better than warp one to get there before it spoils. Your best, Mister O'Brien, hardly seems good enough. I wish I shared your confidence Commander. Believe me, there is no place I'd rather be. Commander, I officially request permission to leave this station. But none of my crew has been affected by this virus of yours, and unless I depart at once my whole cargo will be ruined. Please. I don't want to get sick. I suggest you change your mind. I'm taking aft thrusters to one half. Your orders are no concern of mine. My entire crew has been confined to your hospital. I must leave now while I can still function. Don't worry about me. I'm fine, and I plan to stay that way. And if you think you're going (Sisko mutes the transmission) Dog fellow distance.
