Excuse me. (After a moment, he turns and goes back to the old man.) Excuse me, don't I know you? No, no, I've seen you before. You're Kubus. That's it. Kubus Oak. You worked for the Cardassians. You wait a minute. You're not going anywhere. I know who you are and I know what you did. You're a traitor! This is Kubus Oak! He's a traitor. He worked for the Cardassians. See for yourself.
