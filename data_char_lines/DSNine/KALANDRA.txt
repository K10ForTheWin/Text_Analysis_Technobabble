(a woman) Are you Bashir? Resource said you were on your way. Bashir, jump in. Standard triage. Give him fifteen mils inoprovaline. Get this man into surgery! (Jake moves away from Bashir, viewing the controlled chaos of dealing with war wounds.) (to Jake) There's nothing we can do. He's too far gone. All right. There's an extra surgical table in the back. The graft's holding. Blood throughput is almost a hundred percent. Nice job. We do the best we can, considering the circumstances. So, are things any better for us? Last I heard Starfleet had pulled out of the Arcanis sector. Do you have any idea what ships are involved? We don't get much news here. The Klingons have been jamming the subspace traffic. The Tecumseh. My husband's the science officer. No, I don't suppose he is. I'll be right there. Yes. It helps keep my mind off things. [Cavern - staff room] I just talked to Resource. It's going to be at least three hours before we have power. They're using them to keep the shields up around the settlement. Where is it? You won't be able to beam through the shields. You'll have to take the east tunnel. Everybody listen. Listen! We're evacuating. We're taking the patients out through the north tunnel to the surface. A hopper will take us down the peninsula to the base at Tananda Bay. Resource is sending a security detail to defend the hospital and give us time to evacuate. We can do this. Yes. Let's move. Come on. Go. (As the medics move out, Jake stands there wincing at every detonation.) [Cavern - main ward] (Organised chaos.) Keep moving.
