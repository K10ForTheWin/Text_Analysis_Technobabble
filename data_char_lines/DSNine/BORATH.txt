Commander Sisko, come in. I've looked forward to meeting you. I am Borath. That's correct. You seem surprised. You're referring to Eris, of course. Yes, she is one of us. Though she couldn't very well admit it while you were pointing a phaser at her. I'm glad to see you're not holding one now. Not at all. You seem sceptical. No. I realise you have no reason to trust the Dominion, but you must understand that we were only trying to defend ourselves. We felt threatened by your incursions into the Gamma Quadrant. Commander, you risked your life to bring us a message of peace and friendship. We chose to accept your offer. Would you rather we refused? Good. Because believe me, Commander, an alliance between the Dominion and the Federation will be beneficial to both our people. [Promenade - upper level] Admiral, I think you should tell Commander Sisko what he wants to know. We're confident they'll have no objections. The Jem'Hadar are used only against our enemies. Bajor will be protected, Commander. We'll see to it. Our friendship. Isn't that enough? It's the beginning of a new era, Commander, and you helped make it possible. Congratulations. [Planet surface] (A bird flies down and turns into happy Odo) Please, Commander, don't make us send the Jem'Hadar after you. Please, come in. They can't hear you. Nothing harmful. We're just conducting a little experiment. To see how they'd respond to an attempt by the Dominion to gain a foothold into the Alpha Quadrant. We were curious to see how much they'd be willing to sacrifice to avoid a war. Unfortunately, they're proving to be just as stubborn as I'd feared. You are? Well, that is a problem. But thankfully, it's not one I have to solve. We can't allow them to leave. Your ship is in orbit. You may transport back to it whenever you're ready.
