Clear. (Krim and officers enter) No resistance at all. Minister Jaro's prediction was correct. The Federation has tucked its tail between its legs. [Promenade] Perhaps they knew this old station could never withstand a siege and they abandoned it with Starfleet. We should advise Minister Jaro of our success immediately. Minister, I'm pleased to inform you that we've encountered no resistance so far. We monitored the evacuation of three vessels several hours ago If you're so convinced they're still here, how can you sit and wait for them to attack? What makes you so sure? You can let your engineers play with the machines. I'm sending out search parties. [Conduit] Don't try it. Get their weapons. (The door shuts and the holograms disappear. The manual override doesn't work.) Ridiculous. No Bajoran would ever accept help from them. That is a Federation lie. I was taken prisoner. The Federation is behind all this. Sisko spoke to me. Nothing of consequence. I promised them amnesty. A promise I have no intention of keeping. The Cardassians used duranium composite to shield all the conduits. Proceed with level three. We must have flushed them out. Seal all airlocks. Lock all docking clamps. This is Colonel Day. All security units to airlock fourteen. (Day leaves) Information? Lies. That's all they were. No!
