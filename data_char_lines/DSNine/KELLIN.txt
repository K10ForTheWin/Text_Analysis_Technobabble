Someone hand me a duonetic coupler. Thanks. (Everyone say Hi to  Bill Mumy, veteran Lost In Space sci-fi actor, here fresh from Babylon 5.) You an engineer? Close enough. Grab a microdyne coupler and start recalibrating that transtator. [Base camp] (Nog is watching a Reese check over his phaser rifle.) They're also impossible to detect. I'm sorry, Captain, but I'm an engineer, not a magician. I thought I did. But after banging my head against that communications array for the last few of months, I'm not so sure anymore. Now what? You did it. It doesn't matter. The point is you managed to cut through the jamming signals. That's enough to scan the entire compound. Now the question is, how do we calibrate the tricorder to locate the mines in subspace? You sure you're not an engineer? Doesn't that get confusing? Really. You're talking about Ezri now. Having someone else's memories of being in combat is one thing. Living through it yourself is another. You'll do fine. [Rocky ridge] (They've found the Jem'Hadar encampment and Larkin is watching through binoculars.) Now all we have to do is figure out how to disarm them. Moving them shouldn't be too difficult. Delicate, but not difficult. I think we can manage that. Sorry. My thumb got a little nervous. I wonder if the Jem'Hadar get jittery before a battle.
