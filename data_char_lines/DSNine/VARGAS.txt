I saw movement. I thought it was the Jem'Hadar. Well nobody told me. Supplies. That's great. Don't they know we need to get off this rock? Take it easy? I would love to take it easy. Get me out of this vole hole and I promise you for the rest of my life all I'll do is take it easy! According to Starfleet regulations we're suppose to be rotated off the front lines after ninety days. Ninety days! We've been stuck on this rock for five months, Captain. Take it easy. (Vargas stomps off, muttering.) Are you kidding? I haven't felt this good since the day I landed on this rock. What the hell are you doing? You keep your hands off this bandage. Nobody touches this bandage. Is that understood? I asked you if you understood. McGreevey put this bandage on me. He ripped up his own uniform to make it. He was a jerk. I couldn't stand the guy. He wouldn't shut up. Yap, yap, yap, yap. He thought he was the world's greatest authority on everything. I know, he's dead and I should have more respect, but God I hated him. One moment he's tying the bandage around my arm, talking his head off, and the next minute he's lying flat on his back with a hole in his chest. And I just sat there and I looked at him. That was so great. He was so quiet. One time in his life he's quiet. You can walk by the same spot a hundred times and nothing happens. And then bang. Where'd they go? They're smart all right and we're as good as dead! Someone's coming. How are we going to be able to hold off two columns? Did you hear that? What the hell is that? I can see you've done that before. Maybe they're not coming. Maybe they're turning back. Maybe we got them all. (Roars off, and everyone lines up their sights. The Jem'Hadar charge.)
