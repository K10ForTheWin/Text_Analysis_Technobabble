What's wrong with men from Mars? Hello, Albert. We could walk there together. Who's winning? The matches? I gave them to you. I'll think of something. I suppose I'm sleeping late that day, too. What about W E B du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Ralph Ellison, Richard Wright? Did you ever heard of Native Son? Wishing never changed a damn thing. I'll try to remember that. That's my drawing. I bought it. Can I have my drawing back? I work here. In there. It's the drawing of a space station. See? It's not worth anything except to me. Are you talking to me? Benny? How do you know my name? How about scrambling those eggs today? I have just written the best story of my life. Cassie, we have been over this. I have a job. I am a writer. I've only been working at it for a few years. That was amateur stuff. Sure they were yelling. They want to know why the Giants are in fifth place. Strike three. You're out. How did you get that? Jimmy, you got to turn this around or one days you're going to find yourself in some serious trouble. You keep thinking that way and watch what happens. I'm not trying to lecture you, Jimmy, I'm just trying to help. Why don't you get a job? Sounds like a great life. I'm not doing that anymore. I'm writing about us. Check out next month's issue. I did. Surprised? Why not? What's wrong with that? Easy, easy. What about my story? I want people to read it now. That's not what I wrote. Things are going to change. They have to. You mean maybe it's God's way of telling me that I should quit writing and go into the restaurant business? I'm not a reporter, I'm a writer. I write fiction and the Amsterdam News is not going to publish stories about a space station four hundred years into the future. Oh, no, I'm fine. No, no, no, I just need some air. I'll pick you up about ten. (And escapes into the street.) You again. I don't understand what you want from me. What way? I don't know what you're talking about. Our date? I'm sorry. I was working. It probably won't be, but it doesn't matter. It's what I've got to do. I'm not hungry. What time is it anyway? Okay. I could stay like this forever. [Sisko's quarters] (Sisko and Kasidy are dancing. Sisko's in Benny's clothes but Kasidy has a different dress on.) The Dominion? I don't know. I think I'm losing my mind. [Benny's apartment] (Benny falls against the piano.) I'm starting to see things things from my story. It's as if I'm becoming this Captain Sisko. Lately, I've been asking myself the same question. What's that? Would that make a difference? I think it's better than chalk on the sidewalk. [Harlem street] (Two girls are skipping on the sidewalk.) Can I play? Hey, Jimmy, I got great news. We're headed for the stars. Come on, I'll buy you lunch. I'll tell you all about it. What kind of business? Hey, hey, hey, hold it, hold it. What are you talking about? Hey, Cassie. Yeah, Willie, that's great. But I just hit a grand slam. They are publishing one of my Sisko stories at three cents a word. Three cents a word! That means tonight we are celebrating. Dancing, the works. You're damn right you will. Three cents a word. Three cents a word. [Harlem street] (The jazz is hot and the traffic is slow outside the Rendezvous.) There you are. Yes, but you are getting more and more beautiful day by day. (sings) I'd be happy just to spend my life waiting on your beck and call. I was hoping I'd see you again. I did it. My story's getting published. What happened? I know him. Is that why you shot him? Because he was breaking into a car? A crowbar! I suppose you're right. I should be there when the first copies of this month's issue are delivered. I will restrict myself to a proud grin. I'm fine. (Dark glasses, walking stick and a bandaged hand, Benny leaves.) [Magazine office] Is it here? I'm okay. A novel. Albert, congratulations! Robots? He can't do that. What's that supposed to mean? What exactly is it that he did not like? The artwork, the layout? What high standards is he talking about? No, it's about my story, isn't it? That's what this is all about. He didn't want to publish my story and we all know why. Because my hero is a coloured man. That doesn't make it right and you know it. You're firing me? Well, you can't fire me. I quit. To hell with you, and to hell with Stone. No. I'm tired of being calm. Calm never gotten me a damn thing. You go ahead! Call them! Call anybody you want. They can't do anything to me. Not anymore. And nor can any of you. I am a human being, damn it. You can deny me all you want but you cannot deny Ben Sisko. He exists! That future, that space station, all those people, they exist in here. In my mind, I created it. And every one of you know it. You read it. It's here. You hear what I'm telling you? You can pulp a story but you cannot destroy an idea. Don't you understand? That's ancient knowledge. You cannot destroy an idea. That future, I created it, and it's real. Don't you understand? It is real! I created it and it's real! It's real! Oh, God. (Benny collapses, sobbing. [New York Street] Tell me, please. Who am I? Tell me.
But I haven't finished my story yet. Captain Sisko has found the Orb of the Emissary. But he hasn't opened it yet. No one will give me any paper. No, I don't need to rest. I need to tell my stories. I need to go home. I don't belong here. I'm fine. Then get me a typewriter. Too dangerous to whom? Oh, it is to me. If I don't finish my story, if Captain Sisko doesn't open the Orb box, then he cannot contact the Prophets. But my story! What for? You want me to paint over my story?
