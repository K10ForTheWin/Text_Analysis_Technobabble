Mister O'Brien, we've spoken before. My name is Evek. Shut down your drive and come to a full stop. We're beaming an inspection team aboard. We'll argue about authority later. Now, you will either comply, or we will take preemptive action. You have ten seconds. Thank you for your cooperation. I have orders to arrest you, Mister O'Brien. Search the ship. You have the right to refuse to answer questions, but such refusal may be construed as a sign of guilt. You deny all knowledge of this crime then? So you do not deny all knowledge. Yes, yes. All your rights as defined by Cardassian Articles of Jurisprudence will be protected. We will contact your Commander and see that your wife is returned safely to your station. You will be taken to Central prison on Cardassia Prime to await trial. The Maquis are savage, Federation-born killers. They live [Courtroom] (The torpedoes are in the court as evidence) You terrorise and murder innocent Cardassians, as evidenced by these weapons we confiscated from O'Brien's ship. They are all from Federation settlements in Cardassian-occupied territory. Frankly, the situation is becoming untenable. How many more innocent people must die before the situation becomes clear? According to reliable sources, the Maquis arranged the theft. I'm afraid that information cannot be revealed without risk to national security, Madame Archon. Yes, of course. We learned about them from reliable sources.
