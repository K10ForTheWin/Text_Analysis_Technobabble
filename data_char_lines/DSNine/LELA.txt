No, Lela. You must be Dax's new host. What a beautiful name. Go ahead Talking to Curzon at his zhian'tara. Not missing, right here. (her head) And the name of my Initiate supervisor was Jobel. Thank you. (Guardian leaves) Such odd fellows, these Guardians, huh? Well, it's understandable, I suppose. They spend most of their time underground tending symbiont pools full of this stuff. I love the smell of it, don't you? It looks like you've ended up a long way from home, Jadzia. What is it? It's a habit I picked up when I was a Legislator. I was one of the first women to serve as a council member. When I started out, I talked with my hands a lot. Lots of emphatic gesturing. I discovered some of my male colleagues were imitating of me, so I started to do this. That's the point of the zhian'tara, to discover these kinds of things about yourself. Well in a sense, I am. After all, what is a person but a sum of their memories? I have a feeling that these next few days are going to be extraordinary for you.
