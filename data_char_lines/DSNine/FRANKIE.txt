Well, look who's here. The pretty boy singer himself. What happened to 'Hello, Frankie, long time no see. Make yourself at home. Can I get you anything?' You believe this guy? Were you born in a barn or something? We're a long way from South Philly, ain't we, Vic? Let's just say I'm here to stay, while you, Vicky boy, are about to take a powder. I got news for you, pal. I just bought this hotel. You're history. And you can paper your walls with it. You're finished in this town, Vic. As of this moment, you couldn't get a job as a singing busboy. Now are you going to walk out of here, or do you have to be carried out? Makes no difference to me. Beats me. What's it going to be, pallie? Smart boy. All right, Cicci, come on. Let's check out my casino. (Frankie and Cicci leave.) Not so fast. What kind of card is that to give such a pretty lady. Hit her again. Don't worry about it. Double your bet. (Dealer gives a ten.) Twenty six? What's wrong with you? Again. (queen) You're starting to aggravate me, pal. (five) Twenty one, finally. Pay the lady. If I were you, I'd quit while I was ahead. The name's Frank Chalmers, but everyone calls me Frankie Eyes. Because I don't miss a trick. Doubt is for losers. Well, I'm thinking of writing a book. Well, maybe you can help me think one up. Good title. Mind if I use it? So what do you say we hit the roulette table and see if I can't buy Chapter One. [Holosuite - Las Vegas lounge] Have you ever seen a prettier shade of green? And the night's not over. (He picks up a hundred dollar bill.) It's all yours, baby. And there's more where that came from. (He leans in for a kiss) What are you looking at? Just keep counting. After you, sweetheart. [Holosuite- Casino] (Kasidy is playing a slot machine and talking to the guard by the countroom door) Tell me something I don't know. I already did. In your head. What? You want to be my shill? Bring in a couple of players, then we'll talk. I don't drink with losers. Come on, dollface. Let's warm up the poker table. Looking good, as usual, dollface. I only wish I could see more. Who are they and how much of you have they seen? I bet you don't. [Holosuite- Casino] (Kasidy and O'Brien are playing blackjack.) What do you say we blow some of my money at the crap table? Footsies? I guess that's a start. [Holosuite - Casino] (Al comes out to make his phone call.) This is the hand that shook the hand of Bugsy Siegel, the man that built Las Vegas. I'm telling you, he was a visionary. And is there even one statue of the guy in this town? You can say that again. Sure you don't want to play the tables for a while? Who am I to argue with a lady? [Holosuite - Casino] You in some kind of hurry? You keep staring at that watch. And your drink. You haven't touched it. Pace yourself? For what? I'm busy. Mister Zeemo. We weren't expecting you until tomorrow. No, not at all. Sit down, have a drink. Follow me. Yeah. Right this way. Nobody. Hey, Vic, take a walk. Cicci! Bury him. So long, sucker. Yes, all right. Right this way. I'm telling you, Mister Zeemo, buying this casino was the smartest move you ever made. We're making money hand over fist. [Holosuite- Countroom] I just hope you brought a big enough briefcase. (We look at them through the empty safe.)
