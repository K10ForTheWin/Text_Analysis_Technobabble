(Transmission ends.) I want all power to the disruptors now! You. Get down to the weapons room and find out what's taking them so long. [Klingon corridor] (Kira and Dukat beam in behind a repair team, shoot two and beat up the others.) Lock target. Prepare to fire. (And all the Klingons are beamed off their bridge and onto the Groumall. Dukat and Kira enter.)
