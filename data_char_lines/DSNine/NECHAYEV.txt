Well, Commander, it appears your mission was an even greater success than we hoped. They're already meeting with representatives from the Federation Council and a dozen other Alpha Quadrant alliances. We're hoping to have a treaty signed within a matter of days, and we have you to thank for it. It's a risk, I know, but both the Federation Council and Starfleet Command believe it's one worth taking. By the way, Commander, one of the Founders asked to see you the moment you arrived on the station. If you're not too busy. You asked to see me, Commander? That's correct. The Founders requested that they be excluded. They felt the Romulans would be a disruptive influence. They seemed to think so. Do you have a problem with this, Commander? Commander, if this treaty is signed, and I'm confident it will be, we'll never have to worry about the Romulans again. Quite sure. After all, what chance would they have against the combined power of our new alliance? I'm glad we agree. Believe me, Commander, the Federation carefully weighed all the options before entering into these peace talks. Then we have nothing further to discuss, do we? [Planet surface] Commander, I don't appreciate your barging in here. Are you finished? All right. I suppose he deserves to be the first to hear the news. The Federation is pulling out of this sector. All Starfleet personnel currently stationed on DS Nine will be reassigned to other posts. Yourself included. Our plans for Bajor are on hold for the time being. From now on Bajor will be the Dominion's responsibility. They'll be running this station. It's the price of peace, Benjamin. And you, Benjamin, get a promotion. Captain Sisko. It's an important step toward that Admiralcy you've always wanted. It's too late for that, Ben. The treaty was signed late this afternoon. Commander, I'm ordering you to stand down. Return to the station immediately.
