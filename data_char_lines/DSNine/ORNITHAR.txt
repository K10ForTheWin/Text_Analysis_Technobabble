Mmm, looks like a polyduranium alloy blend. Interesting, but the metal has no real value. A three percent increase is negligible. Nothing, nothing, nothing. The terms are not the issue. I cannot help you locate the Founders because I do not know who they are or if they even exist. (Dax) Nothing. (Kira's earring) Ah, here's something interesting. appears to be diamide laced beritium. I'll give you fifty two diraks for it. There is nothing further to say. If the Founders exist, they clearly do not wish to be contacted. That is good enough for me. Our only contact with the Dominion has been through the Vorta. I have no idea who they report to. All I know is that the Vorta say to do something and you do it. Because if you do not they will send in the Jem'Hadar, and then you die. Commander, we do only as we are told, nothing more. And so far, we have not been told to help you in any way. No, but I prefer to err on the side of caution. I will need to access one of our computers on the surface. (He calls up a starchart on the viewscreen which interests Odo.) This is the Callinon system. The Dominion maintains an unmanned subspace relay on the seventh planet. We have been told by the Vorta to direct all communications there. Where the messages are sent after that is not our concern. It is the Omarion Nebula. If there is nothing else, I would like to leave now.
