Kirk here. Yes, Mister Baris. What can I do for you? I was not aware, Mister Baris, that twelve Klingons constitutes a swarm. Mister Baris, I have guards around the grain. I have guards around the Klingons. I want to know who started it. (O'Brien and Bashir are merged nicely into the line of crewmen.) I'm waiting. (Kirk stops in front of O'Brien, who has replaced Freeman from the original.) Who started the fight? All right. Chekov, I know you. You started it didn't you? Well who did? I don't know, sir. I want to know who threw the first punch. All right, you're all confined to quarters until I find out who started it. Dismissed. [Enterprise corridor] Doctor McCoy, would you mind coming up to the bridge. This is my chicken sandwich and coffee. I want these things off the ship. I don't care if it takes every man we've got, I want them off the ship. (Scott enters with an armful of tribbles.) How? And in the storage compartments. Have him meet us near the storage compartments. We're beaming down. [K-7 grain storage hopper] (Dax and Sisko climb down into a hopper. The tribbles have eaten almost all the grain.) Here, let me try. [K-7 grain storage hopper] Hundreds of thousands. And as captain I want two things done. (Dax tosses out the tribble she is holding.) [K-7 grain storage corridor] First, find Cyrano Jones. (Yup, it's that visual joke again.) And second, close that door. [K-7 grain storage hopper] They don't like you, Mister Darvin. I wonder why? Bones? Lieutenant, er, Lieutenant? All right, Lieutenant. Carry on.
