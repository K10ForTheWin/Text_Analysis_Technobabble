(Cirroc Lofton with hairy caterpillar on his upper lip) Hey, Benny. You wanna buy a watch? I found it. Nice, huh? Anything I can get into, I can get out of. Man, why you always trying to lecture me? You want to help me, you can buy this watch. I can use the cash. As what? A delivery boy or a dishwasher? No, thanks. I like being my own boss, setting my own hours. Yours ain't no better. Writing stories about a bunch of white people living on the moon. Who cares about that? What, coloured people on the moon? Coloured people on the moon. I just might do that. But first, I'm gonna need to raise me some cash. [Magazine office] (Everyone is reading Benny's new story, passing the pages around. The telephone goes unanswered.) I told you you were wasting your time. A coloured captain. The only reason they'll ever let us in space is if they need someone to shine their shoes. Ain't that right, Cassie? Well, I've got news for you. Today or a hundred years from now, it don't make a bit of difference. As far as they're concerned, we'll always be niggers. You keep telling yourself that. Yeah, sure, whatever. (Jimmy keeps looking around, nervously.) Later. I got some business to take care of. Big time. That's all I've got to say. Don't worry about it. It's cool, man. I got it under control. I'll see you around. [Harlem coffee shop]
