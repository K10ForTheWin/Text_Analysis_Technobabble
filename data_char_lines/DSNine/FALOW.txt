I am Falow, Master Surchid of the Wadi. Yes, yes, yes. Now, where are the games? We were told you had games. (an aide whispers) Quark's. Take us to Quark's. We like games. I believe we have. Klon peags. Highly sought in our culture. They have many different uses. Alpha-currant nectar. It's priceless. (She pours Quark a drink, but his face says he wants to spit it out again) Then, we really have nothing to wager, except this. (And pours out a pouch of gem stones. Quark summons a waiter.) We've only just started. (Falow displays his stash of winnings) Replace her. Sit. You like our gemstones? You will have the opportunity to win more. A lot more. In a new game. An honest game. (The dabo wheel is replaced by the Wadi game - an upside down pyramid of 'levels' which Falow places game pieces on.) Chula. These are your players. We'll start them on the second shap. Only children enter at the first shap. [Labyrinth] (Sisko rolls over in bed and wakes up, in his uniform, on a triangular paved floor) Shap two. Move along. Move along home. Move along home. (The door shuts) Last wagers. The board is ready. How much do you wish to risk on the second shap? Roll. You're required to learn as you play. Roll. (one yellow, two blue) Chula! Hardly. Your pieces will meet the Chandra. (He moves the game pieces to a corner) Neither. Both. Ah, but there is the key. Some will never understand while others will consider it mere child's play. (And Falow taps commands into the game console) [Labyrinth] (Sisko is methodically checking doors in corridors when he hears a girl singing) Allamaraine! (Quark gets some gem stones) Choose their path. Short or long. The short path doubles the peril to your four players. It also doubles your winnings. Choose carefully. If none of your players makes it home, you lose everything you've won. Do you? Choose their path. Double their peril. Double your winnings. (Pennies roll down two mental slides and drop into place....) Bet or leave. Choose their path. Roll. [Labyrinth] Drink? Move along. Move along home. Shap four. (A door opens and the party vanishes) Allamaraine! (The pieces are moved down a level and more gems handed over. Odo leaves.) [Ops] Choose their path. Stop the game. Lose your players. Choose their path. Double their peril, double your winnings. Roll. (Quark does) An unfortunate roll. [Labyrinth] Next move. Next move. Choose their path. If you would care to play the game after he's done, it can be arranged. Choose their path. Double their peril, double your winnings. Double the stakes. Roll. (Quark holds out the dice to Odo) Thialo. (Two gold, one blue) Sacrifice one so that two may live. If you do not sacrifice one, all three will be lost. Which player? Select one to be sacrificed or else this game is finished. Very well. No. You do not. We'll programme the game to choose one at random. Final wagers. Last move. [Labyrinth] Thialo. Move along home. Shap Six. No, Quark. I'm afraid all your players were lost. It's only a game. (Falow puts in some commands, the game disappears into a small box and the dabo table is back) Time to move along home. If you will excuse us. Perhaps, someday, a rematch.
