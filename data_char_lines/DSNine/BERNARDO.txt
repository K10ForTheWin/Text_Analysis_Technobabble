Hey Vin, we've been working all night why don't we forget these guys? I just want to go home and see Sonya and the kids and get some sleep. Same year as it was yesterday. Twenty twenty four. Let's go. Okay, let's go. Hurry it up. Sonya's going to kill me. [Sanctuary District Street] (Basically, it's a slum.) Thanks, Vin.
Nothing. Wait. I'll do it. Hey, Vin, we're not on duty now so don't give me orders. I just want to make it home in one piece. He didn't say anything. Quiet down, Vin. You'll only make things worse. Sure you are. Yeah. Right now those two kids are sitting at home wondering if they'll ever see their dad again. You think they're just going to close down the Sanctuary and let you walk out of here? I just want to get home, you know? Get out of here. The fifteen Kings could've taken them any day. Am I right? So what do we do with them? Vin! How can we explain what happened to them? Come on, let's get you out of here.
