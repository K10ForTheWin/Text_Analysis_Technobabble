Hoya to Captain Sisko. (female Benzite without a breather) Sir, our sensors have detected a ship dropping out of warp. [Base camp] I'm not sure, sir. [Runabout] I can't get a good reading on it. Plasma leaks from its warp nacelles are disrupting our sensors. [Base camp] Whatever it is, it's fallen into the gravitational pull of the planet. It should enter the atmosphere near your position. (Something streaks through the atmosphere.) Sir, the ship withstood the impact. I can't determine that. [Runabout] We're having trouble penetrating the hull with our sensors. Hoya to Captain Sisko. A Jem'Hadar warship [Runabout] Has just dropped out of warp. They've locked phasers on us. Hard to port. (Boom) Shields are down! Engage warp [Crash site] (There's a short fiery streak in the bright sky. Then Jem'Hadar unshroud and attack. T'Lor is killed.)
