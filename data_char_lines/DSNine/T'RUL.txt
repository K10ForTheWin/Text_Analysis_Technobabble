Bridge to Commander Sisko. We've reached the Callinon System.
I'm fine. I had a minor disagreement with some Starfleet security officers. They refused to allow me to speak with the Federation's negotiating team. I wanted to protest the exclusion of the Romulan Empire from the treaty negotiations. Every great power in the Alpha Quadrant has been invited to participate except for us. The mistake is thinking the Romulan empire will stand by and allow such a betrayal to go unchallenged. Believe me, Doctor, if a treaty is signed without our approval, it will mean war. Commander Sisko! The last thing I remember is being shot by some Jem'Hadar soldier.
