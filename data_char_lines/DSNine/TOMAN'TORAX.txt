A Klingon. As it should be. It is our duty to punish those who would break their vow of loyalty. Yes. He has the look of a warrior but the heart of a coward. One day the Klingon Empire will fall before the Jem'Hadar. And when that day comes, and piles of Klingons lie dead at my feet, I will think of you standing here impotent and weak, and I will laugh. (Worf grabs the Jem'Hadar around the neck while Toman'torax grabs Worf's throat.) Human, come with me. It is time to resume our battle drills. I'm ready now. They stuff themselves with food but have no appetite for battle. Ready to flee at the first sign of danger. Let's go. You can practice running away. (Toman'torax grabs O'Brien's shoulder so Worf hits Toman'torax.) I've always wanted to kill a Klingon. (And a general brawl breaks out. Sisko enters) And I. And I defied them. I deserve punishment.
