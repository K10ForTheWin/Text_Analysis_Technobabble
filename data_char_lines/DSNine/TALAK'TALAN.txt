It's too late. You're done running. That's enough. That's not my concern. Because the Founders don't want you released. That's not your concern. Don't bother, Commander. I'm not going to do any permanent damage. (He throws Quark away.) Those aren't my orders. The Founders exist. They created the Dominion. A Ferengi and a human. I was hoping the first race I'd meet from the other side of the anomaly would be the Klingons. It's too late for apologies. The Dominion will no longer stand by and allow ships from your side to violate our territory. I hear that Klingons are effective warriors. What's that weapon they're so fond of? The bat'leth? All right. Then what about the Cardassians? Are you satisfied with the treaty your Federation made with them? It seems a tactical error. We gain more knowledge every day, and now we have you to help us learn more. I won't be the one asking the questions. I was really hoping to meet a Klingon. (Talak'talan leaves and reestablishes the containment field.) I'm Third Talak'Talan of the Jem'Hadar. I'm here to inform you that your commander has been detained for questioning by the Dominion. Indefinitely. Commander Sisko will serve as an example of what happens to anyone who interferes with the Dominion. Coming through the anomaly is interference enough. Unless you wish to continue to offend the Dominion, I suggest you stay on your side of the galaxy. We anticipated that response. (He walks through the forcefield.) Here's a list of vessels we've destroyed for violating our territory. (And puts down a small PADD.) From the Bajoran colony on our side of the anomaly. You should be proud. I hear they fought well for a spiritual people. I hope we won't have to repeat this lesson. (Talak'Talan beams out)
The Dominion will no longer stand by and allow ships from your side to violate our territory.
