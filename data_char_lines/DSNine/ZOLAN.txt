Have a seat. I'll get us all some refreshment. (The boy and Garak look at each other for a long time) All right, here we go. Here we go. Baby, come on. Dabo! Dabo! Dabo! Dabo is a passion of mine. I remember you. You're Doctor Bashir, yes. How's the Cardassian? Still has all his fingers, I presume? He's a strange boy, Rugal. Dabo! Look, this is really none of my business. I'd really rather you asked someone else. Well enough. I heard the father was looking for a new job several months ago and I offered to help. I visited them on Bajor several times. It must be torture for that boy living like that. Hated by people he thinks of as his parents. Told day after day that he's worthless Cardassian scum. Beaten if he even looks the wrong way. Rugal is their revenge. Their revenge against all Cardassians. [Guest quarters]
