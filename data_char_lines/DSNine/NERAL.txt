Doctor Julian Bashir, you are appearing before the Continuing Committee of the Romulan People. Any statements will be made part of the official record. Senator Cretak is charged with attempting to access a Tal'Shiar database without proper authorisation. The Senator has told the Committee a remarkable story. Since you're a key figure in her story, we are most eager to hear your version of the events. Why her? But you felt that you could trust a Romulan Senator? Continue. Senator Cretak, why didn't you come to me with this information? As well you should, Kimara. So there was an assassination plan? It is the finding of this Committee that Senator Cretak has conspired to commit treason against the State. Sentence to be determined at a later date. Doctor Bashir will be returned to the Bellerophon. Mister Sloan is remanded to the custody of the Tal'Shiar for further interrogation.
