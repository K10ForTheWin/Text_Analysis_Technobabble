(After the credits, Dax returns with her hair loose.) (red veins) Oh, you're still here. I see the Blight has spared you. Maybe it doesn't like the taste of your blood. I'd invite you to my death, but we don't know each other that well. Don't tell me. You have a cure. Yeah? What will it cost me? A good coat? A tilo of oil? What will you do? See how loud we scream when the Blight burns through us? How did you do that? I suppose you're going to want to bleed me? I cancelled my death for you. I was really looking forward to it. (Time passes. It is night and the divisions in the room have come down to make a full scale ward) I like your spots. I still like them. Help me, Bashir.
