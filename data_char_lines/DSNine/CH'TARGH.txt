Alexander Rozhenko. We were holding it just for you. The honour is ours. (dusts the seat) Please. Bregit lung. An excellent choice. Would you care for some grapok sauce? Oh, you must try some. It brings out the flavour. (And pours the whole bottle onto Alexander's food.) Some bloodwine to wash it down? Or perhaps the son of our illustrious First Officer would prefer an Earth beverage. A glass of root beer with a lump of ice cream? (Everyone is in hysterics.) Now why would I mock you, son of Worf? I will call you whatever I please and you will learn to like it. (Alexander gets up.) Does the son of Starfleet's finest think he is too good to eat with us? I do not like your smile. Perhaps I will cut you a new one. (Knife fight, but Alexander is nervous and unskilled) He fights like a Ferengi. (Worf enters and the crowd goes quiet. Alexander gets lucky and cuts Ch'Targh's arm.) Shakk-TAH! (Ch'Targh leads him in then knocks him flying into the wall.) Your combat training has been sadly neglected, little one. I will teach you a new lesson. One you will not soon forget. (Worf takes Ch'Targh's arm.) Are you going to fight the Jem'Hadar for him as well? [Dukat's quarters] (Looking at a simple, elegant drawing of a flower.) Keep a close watch. There may be more hostile simulation programmes out there. (The crew laugh. Worf starts forward but Martok stops him.) At least you're keeping us on our toes. I will go with him. It will take at least two of us to secure the injector before it explodes. We sealed the impulse injector, Commander. Trapped in that corridor, sir. After we secured the injector, I sent him in there to put away the tools and somehow he tripped the emergency lockdown. We are trying to override it now. (The bulkhead slides aside and out Alexander comes, coughing.)
