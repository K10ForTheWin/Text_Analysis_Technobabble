Bajor simply cannot absorb three million refugees at this time. This decision is not based strictly on Bajoran self-interest. Such a huge increase in population would prove to be tragic to your people as well as ours. But what if they're not? What is Bajor to do if your people start dying? And where would that aid come from? Our resources are already depleted. To help you would mean depriving our own people.
