(a woman) I am Seltin Rakal of Meridian. I expect it must have come as something of a surprise. Not nowhere, Commander, but a dimension that intersects with this one. I could explain more in detail, if you're interested. We were just about to sit down for First Meal. Why don't you join us? Don't worry. We'll be here for a while.
