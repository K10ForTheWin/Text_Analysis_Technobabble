Don't worry, just a minor disagreement. [Quark's quarters] We'll give you five thousand vats. I'm offering you five thousand vats. I suggest you take it. I know we should be talking to Zek. Now see what you've done. You've made me look foolish. Because if we kill you, (Inglatu snaps the PADD in half) Zek will have to talk to us. We'll think about it. [Ops] Oh, it's you, Ferengi. Aren't you on the wrong side of the wormhole? You had your chance. Go away. You are starting to annoy me. (Quark knocks over a wine barrel) I should have killed you back on that station. All right. You can have the ten thousand vats. I told you before, that's impossible. Fine. Then stay. [Sleeping quarters] (An area surrounded by gauze curtains, with just one bed)
