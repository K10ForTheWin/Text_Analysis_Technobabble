Miles Edward O'Brien. The Argrathi Authority has been conducting a review of your case. Do you wish to add anything to the official record? (O'Brien shakes his grizzled, bearded head.) No matter. Your correction is completed. You are free. The crime of espionage requires a minimum of fifteen cycles of correction. You've been here for twenty. It's time for you to go. That's not my concern. Remove him. (The guard uses his cattle prod and throws the screaming O'Brien into the bright light outside the cell.) [Argrathi treatment room] (A uniformed and clean-shaven O'Brien is strapped down and screaming. An Argrathi removes electrodes from his head and unfastens him.) There. It's done. Only a few hours passed during your correction. The Major is correct. We punish our offenders by giving them memories of incarceration modelled to fit each offender's personality. It's more efficient and much more effective than maintaining an extensive prison system.
