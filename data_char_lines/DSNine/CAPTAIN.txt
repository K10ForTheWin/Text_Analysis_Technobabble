(a Vulcan) Red alert. Load all torpedo bays. Ready phasers. Move us to position alpha, Ensign. (The space battle begins) Recalibrate shield nutation. Maintain all Argh! (Everything goes BOOM) But you claim you do not know what it will be.
Two twenty, bottom price two twenty. (But the deal's not made and he walks away.) That's right. Why not? One thing about Cardassians, they pay their bills. Look, if you're trying to buy some yamok sauce from me, boy, you're wasting your time. I'm not carrying any. Where would you two boys get all that yamok sauce? Five thousand, you say. That's a lot of latinum. Look, I'm not carrying any latinum. But I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll trade you something for it. I'll give you a hundred gross of self-sealing stem bolts. Some Bajoran ordered them from me, and now he can't pay. Top grade merchandise. You won't find a better stem bolt in this sector. Good. I'll meet you at cargo bay nine at twenty one hundred hours. We'll make the trade then. (The Captain walks on.)
This is the Kobheerian freighter Rak-Miunis, requesting permission to dock. Thank you. We have a passenger on board requiring medical assistance. He says it's a condition called Kalla-Nohra. It's apparently chronic, but he doesn't have his medication. Thank you, Commander. Rak-Miunis out.
Hi, Quark. How are your lobes? No, I don't have time. My ship's about to pull out. Do you know of anyone going to Bajor? I promised someone I'd deliver this for them. Doesn't looks like I'm going to get there this trip. I know it's an earring. It was given to me by a maintenance worker on Cardassia Four. He asked me to take it to Bajor. Said whoever I showed it to would understand. Well, this is a Bajoran station, right? There must be someone here who would know what to do with it. Who?
