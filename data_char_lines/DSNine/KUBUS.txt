You must be mistaken. Out of my way. I decided it was time to come home. I never doubted your ability to handle the situation, Odo. You always were good at your job. I served the only recognised government on Bajor during the occupation. If it wasn't for us, the situation on Bajor would have been ten times worse than it was. Really? I never could stand that arrogant tyrant. It kept me alive. Bajor is my home. I never should have left it. Then I suppose you're the one I should be talking to. I'm not asking you to like me. I'm simply requesting that I be allowed to return home. I doubt if you have the authority to make that decision. Major, I'm an old man. I don't have many years left. What's the harm of letting me live them out on Bajor? The Bajoran Government. Mine. No. He wasn't a collaborator, he was only a messenger between the Cardassians and the Vedek Assembly. At the time I could see in the weeks prior to the massacre that something was bothering him. He was tense and nervous and he was in constant communication with the Vedek Assembly. Not at the time, but the day after the incident, Vedek Bareil came to visit him on the station. I saw Bareil enter Bek's quarters, which were in the same section as mine. He was in there for a couple of hours and at times I could hear shouting through the bulkhead. No, but I saw Bareil when he left the station. He was upset. In the morning, Bek hung himself. Well isn't that enough? Bek was obviously working with Bareil and when he realised the enormity of what he'd done, he must've wanted to confess. Bareil wouldn't allow it, so Bek took the only way out he had.
