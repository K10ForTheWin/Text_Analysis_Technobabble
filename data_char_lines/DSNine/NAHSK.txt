Absolutely. Waiting for you. Really? Was it nice? We're business associates of Morn's. We trusted Morn. That wouldn't be good. I don't like beets. (taking the painting) Very nice. I'm sorry. About the painting. I get upset. I don't like to get upset. I really am sorry about the painting. [Quark's quarters] You should invest in a better lock. We'll be back there. (The brothers go into the back room and the door opens.) You know, it must be nine years. Hey, it's Larell. There was five of us. Morn helped. You see, we can't be prosecuted anymore. If you stand still this won't hurt as much. (Nahsk takes out a knife and grabs Quark's hand. Quark starts screaming.) This isn't fair. We stole it. He had nothing to do with it. That's two hundred and fifty bricks each. That's not very smart, sitting with your back to the door. I'm not slow. (Nahsk turns his weapon on Krit. Quark ducks.)
