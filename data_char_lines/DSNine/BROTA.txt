Q'apla. We are the Sons of Mogh. Some by blood, some by choice. Our hearts are Klingon. We live as warriors, just as you taught our ancestors long ago. The Sons of Mogh are gathering to celebrate your return. It would honour us greatly if you would feast with us tonight. We'll come for you at nightfall. Tomorrow we will see the sun rise again, but no one here will see it set. You honour us with your words. We have tried to live as you taught us to. Last year, I slew a yarbear three metres tall. Your mek'leth was my only weapon. The beast maimed me, and for a time it seemed I would die from my wounds. Now I wish I had. It would have been a warrior's death. No. Ceasing to exist because my parents were never born? That is not a death worthy of Sto'Vo'Kor. Kill me, Worf. I have no enemies to fight, no glory to be won. Give me an honourable death. You said there was an enemy for us to fight. Bring the others. (And the sun sweeps on in its course. Molly brings O'Brien a plant.)
