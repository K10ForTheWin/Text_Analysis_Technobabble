Well, it beats working on the waste extraction system. Besides, how often does an engineer get to wear a phaser? Chief, here's the wish list you wanted. Three categories. Must Have, which includes the manifolds and the plasma recoilers. Could Use, things like EPS matrix converters and Would be Nice. Bypass displacers, polarity maximisers, that sort of thing. A low priority, but if we happen to find some. Right. (Later still. Now Nog is at helm.) If you're telling me that there are two Cardassian soldiers from the Third Battalion loose on this station, we're in trouble. Death to All. That was their motto. How? The station's subspace transceiver was ripped out when the Cardassians evacuated. We could use the station like an old-fashioned telegraph and tap out an SOS. Do you mind not aiming that at me? Maybe I did activate the turbolift without realising it. (There's a door noise overhead.) Okay. (Pechetti sees an insignia in a glass case. As he admires it he gets grabbed by a Cardassian.)
