I deal in fine wares, mostly fabrics and fragrances. I was cleared of those charges. It was a case of mistaken identity. Yes. (He opens the pyramidical case and Odo scans the contents.) A lady friend? It has a somewhat floral bouquet. I felt the blast. Was he hurt? That one is more musky than the first. The Ferengi's bar. I went there as soon as I arrived this morning. I suppose I'd have to describe that one as spicy. The rest of the day. Right up until your deputy came and brought me here. So, have you found something for your lady friend? Why not? (Odo puts a couple of drops onto a small dish and waves it under Retaya's nose.) Very nice. I really don't think they would go well together. I really don't think your lady friend will like the aroma. I had no idea. As I said, I simply didn't think your friend would like the aroma. Unless you have any more questions, I'd like to go now. I have deliveries to make on Cardassia.
