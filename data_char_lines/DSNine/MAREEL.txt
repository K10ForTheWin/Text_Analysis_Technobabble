(the woman) This one must be the shape-shifter. Don't worry, Verad. It's going to be all right. (Mareel takes the comm. badges) That's enough. Now it's Verad's turn to be lucky. Can you think of a better place to start a new life? Yeto, T'Kar. It's time. Let's go. (to Verad) Good luck. I know. [infirmary] (Dax and Verad are lying on two operating beds. Bashir goes to put something on Verad's forehead.) I don't want to kill you, Commander, but I will. [Infirmary] (Bashir removes Dax from Jadzia's pouch, cuts the cord, then slides it into Verad's pouch.) [Ops] Are you all right? Don't try that again. I don't want to have to hurt anyone. That's different. You heard Verad. They didn't leave him any other choice. I owe him. I grew up on the streets of Khefka Four. I never would've made it out of there without Verad. He was the communications clerk at the Federation consulate. He used to come by the accommodation house where I worked. I used to help him relax. When he was recalled to Trill he asked me to go with him. We've been together ever since. I owe him my life. If there's anything I can do for him, I'll do it. Losing him? Verad told me that you'd say things like that. I know he'll change. He'll be smarter, more confident, but in all the important ways, he'll be the same. If you think I'm going to betray Verad, you're wrong. It doesn't matter what you say. I love him, and I'm going to stand by him no matter what. Verad. (Mareel goes to embrace Verad but he gently holds her away) Don't listen to him. He's just trying to confuse you. Why are you wasting your time with him? Here, drink this. Senarian egg broth. It'll keep your strength up. All right, don't drink it. It makes no difference to me. He's better than he was. I do. He's under a lot of stress. What's your point, Commander? You're trying to turn me against Verad. All right then, Verad Dax. But it won't work. Nothing has changed between us. Yes. Talk to him about what? I don't want to disturb him. Because I don't want to. That's enough. I said, that's enough! No. Everything's fine. Stay back. (T'Kar slams Quark into a railing) Good. I'm getting tired of waiting here. How are you feeling? You just worry about getting through the wormhole. The Klingons and I'll make sure that no one stops you. The sooner you leave, the sooner I can follow, and the sooner we can be together. (He doesn't return her hug) It's going to be all right, isn't it? You better take a hostage, just in case. Good luck. You don't really expect me to tell you? How would you know? The plan was the was supposed to get there first. That he would wait for me, not the other way around. He lied to me. He's never lied to me before. He's not coming. He doesn't need me anymore. You never give up, do you? I told you I'm not going to betray him. All you care about is Jadzia. If you hurt him, I'll kill you. (She hands over the phaser and comm. badge) You're not alone, Verad. I'm here. I'll always be here.
