I know exactly the one you're talking about. He was the only Cardassian boy we had at the time. We had several girls. That's what we were told. Yes, that was the most unusual thing about his arrival. Virtually all of the other Cardassian children turned in to us were found on the streets by Bajorans. Rugal was brought in by a Cardassian. Yes, as a matter of fact, she was. I don't remember her name, but she was attached to the command post at Terok Nor. Is there anything else, Doctor? [Schoolroom]
