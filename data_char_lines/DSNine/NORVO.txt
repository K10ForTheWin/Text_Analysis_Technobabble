(brother) Zee! I cannot believe you're really here. You cut your hair. It'll take a some getting used to. Mom insisted on hanging it in here. I hate it. Well, the composition is puerile and obvious. The colours belong on a child's toy and the technique is laughable. It's perfect. She cut it. I think it brings out her eyes, gives her more of a classic look. So how long are you staying? I'm still working on it. I miscalculated some of the revenues. I have to redo them. Why are you getting rid of Lorkin? What do you think? You mean Bokar was behind it? Maybe we should tell Mother. I don't know. Did any of them wonder if you I'm sure all joined Trills go through this. Absolutely. Come in, Zee. No one else would bother with the chime. Here, have a seat. All the bad ones. Just being realistic. It's amateurish. I know that. It says so right there. Saurian brandy? Oh. I should probably get a clean one. To my sister. A shining angel in a dark sky. It's the best. I'm not very good, Zee. I never was. All this, it's an indulgence. Just like my other hobbies, poetry, music. I can't concentrate. My mind wanders. I don't have the discipline it takes to succeed. I'm fine with the way things have turned out, really. Besides, they need me here. Thanks. Thank you. Good night. [Tigan home office] Good morning. Oh. Mother is not going to be happy about this. Miles? Oh, your friend. They found him? Great. That's great, Zee. Does that mean you're leaving? What can I say? When I get drunk, I become an art critic. Not really. I never liked those pieces anyway. I'm feeling like I don't want to be analysed by my sister. The situation is not that complex, Zee. I am wallowing in self pity and acting out my frustrations by throwing tantrums. Mother disapproves of suicide. All that blood on the carpets. Best I can do with a hangover. What do you mean? Mother would go insane. I can't just pick up and leave. I don't know if I can leave all this on Janel's shoulders. It's not that simple. There are some things going on that are complicated. Things with the company. I don't know, Zee. Take a vacation. Clear my head. I don't know. I guess I don't, really. I just. But it'd be nice to spend some time with Ezri Yes. Almost. Yes, ma'am. (Norvo leaves.) Mother, he wouldn't have killed her. Why won't you listen to him? He didn't do it. I'm the idiot brother. How would I know? I tried to reason with her, but she was very angry. Angry at the Syndicate, angry at us. Even angry at her husband for getting himself killed. I didn't go there to kill her, Zee. I really didn't. But she wouldn't listen to me. She started yelling, said that our family was just as bad as the Syndicate. That we were all liars and cheats. And then suddenly I realised that if she were dead all of our problems would go away. I took care of it. You always said that I was too weak to handle the tough ones. I'm not. I proved it. I handled a problem that you couldn't. I handled it. (Later, Norvo is taken away in handcuffs.)
