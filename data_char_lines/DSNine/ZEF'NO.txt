Somebody had better be able to help me. I have been delayed for six hours. I can assure you the Kressarian government will lodge a formal protest Yes, yes I know all that. I didn't know they were going to be opening every container in my cargo hold. You understand these are highly sensitive herbaceous materials? This is ridiculous. I have a schedule to keep. That's what I was told a few hours ago. [Kressari cargo bay] (O'Brien is carrying a container) Prepare for immediate departure. (A panel on that container turns into a rat) [Monastery garden] Begin transport. Very well. If you'll sign off on the shipment, we'll be on our way. (The Cardassian puts his thumb print on the PADD)
