I understand you've been looking for me. I take it you're in the market for something. You know me better than that. Those disruptors were working fine when I gave them to you. What happened after that, I don't know. Perhaps you dropped them? (Flith hands Bilby a disrupter.) You know I can't do that. You took delivery. That's correct. That must be it. (Bilby shoots Yint in the leg.) If you want your money back, you can have it.
