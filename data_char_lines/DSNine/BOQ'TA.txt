(Bolian) Booby-traps? I can't believe I let you talk me into volunteering for this. It's a biogenic compound. These look like stasis tubes. (Garak lifts off the girder and opens the chamber. A skeleton is inside.) Cardassian. He's been dead for about a year. Hey, look at this. A regimental badge. This is going to make Pechetti's day. We've got to get out of here. Let's call for help. The Cardassians must've surprised them. They're probably using the internal sensors to track us. I'm done. We're going to split up? But Chief, what if we can't Stolzoff was supposed to be watching Pechetti's back. Look what happened to them. It's all right, Chief. He can stay with you. For some reason, knowing Garak's going after those Cardassians makes me feel better. [Empok Nor Infirmary] (Garak is trying to work a console.) You know, I once bought a suit from Garak. Turns out the sleeve was a little long. I remember being angry when I brought it in to be fixed. If I had known he was so dangerous, I never would've complained. You think he'll get the other Cardassian? I don't blame you. (Garak is watching them.) I can't get this loose. Give me the coil spanner, would you? (Amaro puts down his rifle and rummages in the tool box.) It's got two pointy things on the end. (Boq'ta screams. Amaro turns and hears a crack as the soldier breaks Boq'ta's neck. Then Garak shoots the soldier in the back.)
