(round middle-aged man) Please don't leave us here, Karen. Please. I don't like it here. I want to go home. (Doorbell) Is that true? Did you passed as normal? Is that true? If you'd told the truth, you could have lived with us at the Institute. I'll go set the table. (Bashir leaves.) Sounds like the plasma flow's out of sync. Better realign it. He's sad. He's killed someone. Someone's making him say all this. He doesn't want to. The queen, maybe, or a princess. The story's not over. They want the Kabrel system. They kept avoiding it with their eyes. They kept avoiding it. It's a party! (Patrick hands out party hats.) It's a party. He doesn't like me. No, you don't. There's nothing wrong with that power coupling. How, Jack? What can we do? I'm Patrick. He's not supposed to be here. What are they going to do to us? He was here, Jack. I remember. Will you come visit us?
Finally. (It's our trio from Statistical Probabilities in Starfleet uniforms.) That's a stupid question. That's a stupid question, too. That's a stupid question. Jack, you didn't say anything about us getting in trouble. That's a stupid What are they going to do to us? Are you really going to be able to make her better? Keep going. A little to the left. (They put down Lauren's couch.) That's not where it was last time. Much better. (Bashir enters.) Here he is. That's right, Jack. I remember. Hurry back. [Infirmary] Did you move this? Oh. Did you hear what she said? Did you hear that? We missed you. Did the surgery hurt? (bass) Do. Fa mi ray do. Fa me ray do. How much time do we have left? Oh, no. (Lauren has Nog's biography on a PADD.) That's what we're trying to figure out, Sarina. That would do the trick. Manipulating subspace. That doesn't seem fair. She's not? We're never going to see her again. Couldn't you make us normal like you did for Sarina, and then we could all stay together. I'm sure. I think we passed it. That's a stupid question. [Bashir's quarters] (Doorbell.) She can still talk, it's just that she's afraid to.
