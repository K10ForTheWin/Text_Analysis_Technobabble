Where you been, Mommy? Can I come to school?
Rumpelstiltskin. Rumpelstiltskin. I'm not tired! Mommy? He's in my room. Rumpelstiltskin.
Where are we going? Are you coming too, Daddy?
Go away. No. (Molly leaves)
No. I don't feel so good. Hi. Lots better. In her room, sad. I will.
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! I have a little brother! No. He's in there. Did I win? Look, I drew a pony. I don't know. I don't want to. I'm colouring. (O'Brien looks at his Irish warrior costume with sadness and longing.) [Captain's office]
I'm done. Can I go colour? Okay. Do you want to come colour with me? Daddy, come see what I drew. Daddy. You have to come see. Daddy, come on. Please, Daddy, please. Daddy's home! Daddy's home! (Molly hugs his legs.)
I'm hungry. Are you my aunt? Aunt Nerys, can I play in your room?
Hi, Daddy. Mommy told me I could call you. When are you going to come (The hairbrush tugs.) Ow! Mommy, that hurt. How long is that, Daddy?
(another red-head) It's just genetics, Lisa. Like Torvin's ridges. Hello. And they needed a shelter quickly before the winter came. Bye. (The girls leave.) Thank you. (Molly takes it to Bashir.) Aren't you going to help? You don't look busy. Really? Can I meet her? By summer, this plant will be taller than you. After the harvested, I'll help my mother make gelm bread with it.
Wake up, it's time to go. It's almost seven. Time to get ready. The picnic! Yes. Don't you remember? I'm going to wear my blue jumper. Mommy, can you help me put this on? (It's a bracelet.) This is where we're going, Yoshi. See? (A group photograph in front of a tree.) Last time we went to Golana, you were inside Mommy's tummy. Can we bring Chester? Come on, Lupi. (a doll) I know what I'm going to be when I grow up. Mm hm. I'm going to be an exobologist. Someone who studies animals from other planets. Daddy, if you send us away again, can we take Chester? You're not? I know. Promise? You want to see me do some cartwheels? Daddy! Daddy, help. I want my mommy and daddy. Mommy. Mommy? The girl who found me, can I see her again? She was so nice. Look. It's where we had the picnic. (In her picture, the trees and suns have faces, and so does the rock.) Don't you like it?
I let you play with my toys. I knew it. We're not going back to Earth. Then why haven't you told Julian?
