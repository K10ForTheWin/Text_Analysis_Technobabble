I am Drofo Awa, Hetman of this vessel. What do you want from us? Well then you believe wrong, Commander. My ship is carrying five kilotons of Regreein wheat husks, nothing more. Permission denied. And if there's any attempt to board my vessel, I will consider it an act of piracy. Is that clear? In that case, Commander I don't understand. You're a Cardassian. No, wait! It's not that simple. I've already been paid! Stop counting! Stop counting. I'll await your arrival, Commander. (transmission ends)
