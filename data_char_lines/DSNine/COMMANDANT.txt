Captain Sisko, is there something I can do for you? Go on. Are you saying that's in the official records? Is this a secure line? One moment. (The Academy logo pops up then the Commandant is back.) Sorry, Captain, but I think you'll agree that this is a time for caution. Does Admiral Leyton know about this report? Listen to me, Captain. I want that record erased before anyone else can see it. Is that understood? Good. That report could cause us a lot of trouble. I'm glad you spotted it. They're fine young men and women. When Leyton talked to me about using them I thought it was a mistake, but I must to admit they performed their mission admirably. I appreciate your call, Captain. I'm in your debt.
