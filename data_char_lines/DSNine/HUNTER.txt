I have Tosk. [Promenade] Alive. It is over. (The two aliens beam out) [Holding area] (The hunter takes off his helmet. He's similar to Tosk but more mammalian with a head of hair) What a disappointment. And after such an entertaining beginning These aliens gave us a great deal of resistance. We wondered how you got their cooperation without violating your oath of silence. But to see you here, caged, helpless. How could you allow this? It is a disgrace to all Tosk. And the most disappointing hunt in memory. You were right. This Tosk is unworthy of such a noble description. For this dishonour, you'll endure the greatest humiliation Tosk can know. To be captured and brought home alive. You will live out your existence on public display where children can make fun of you, toss you scraps of food which is more than you deserve. Release him. Over this Tosk? [Commander's office] Have you nothing similar in your own society? But he is sentient only because we have made him sentient. He has been bred for the hunt. His entire reason to exist is the hunt. To make it as exciting, as interesting, as he can. Obviously, you do not comprehend. Abuse? We honour Tosk. They are the symbol of all that is noble and courageous. They train and condition themselves all their lives for this event. They're proud of their role in our culture. In the future, passage through the anomaly will be considered out of bounds for the hunt. Will that satisfy you? Now you will arrange for the release of the Tosk. (Hunter beams out) [Ops] Our ritual requires it when a Tosk is captured alive. Do not trouble yourself. My ship will transport us. Very well. (Hunter and Tosk leave, and Miles throws his comm. badge onto Odo's desk.) [Commander's office] (into comm.) The hunt has resumed. [Promenade - upper level] No. He is mine. (Hunter fires. Tosk pushes O'Brien aside and dodges the fire)
