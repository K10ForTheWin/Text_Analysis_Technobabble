We have established a defence perimeter around the entrance to the cavern. I have sent out two patrols to reconnoiter the shoreline in both directions. The Vorta's condition has worsened. He will die soon. I vaporised their bodies myself, and redistributed their equipment to the rest of the men. You are now the First. You were right to question him. If he had not ordered us into the nebula two days ago we would not have crashed. And Victory is Life. And if we cannot re-establish communications? Only one? I can't take it. (He starts firing. Our people dive for cover and return fire.) [Cliff] (Remata'Klan arrives.) You have been ordered to stop firing! I did. I am no longer able to shroud myself. (Another Jem'Hadar shakes his head.) Understood. Remata'Klan, I regret my disobedience. [Shoreline] Understood. (Sisko and Remata'Klan meet.)
