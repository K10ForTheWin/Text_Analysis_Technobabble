You'd better have a good reason for dragging me in here. (Everyone say Hi! to  Michael Ansara, not playing a Klingon this time.) Well, well. You're the changeling. Odo, if I remember correctly. Lwaxana told me all about you. How you broke her heart. Strange she'd come running to you for protection. The pregnancy must have her confused, poor woman. I've come a long way, I'm not going to leave here empty-handed. I am not talking about her. I am talking about my son. I intend to see that he is raised by men, not by the pampering foolishness of women. Her intentions do not concern me. As her husband, I have a legal right to my son. Exactly. I'm sure you are. It's not too late to call this off. Your dignity is important to you. I understand that. I would not want anyone to see me go through a charade like this. Am I the only one finds this little more than a pale declaration of love? He could be talking about any woman. Then prove it to us. I cherished you, Lwaxana. You were my most treasured possession. Take care of our son. When he asks, speak well of me. (Jeyal leaves.)
