Federation Commander, you've taken aboard a known criminal. You will turn him over to us. You have not granted it. He is Kohn-Ma! Even the Bajorans would not grant his kind asylum. He has committed heinous crimes against the Cardassian people and I demand you release him to our custody. We have made no threat to your facility. If you require all vessels to endure such lengthy docking procedures, Commander, you're going to have a lot of impatient traffic out there. I accept your apology, but not your explanation. What about Tahna Los? A diplomatic insult to the Cardassian people would be a problem. Delivering a wanted criminal to us would not be. I can only tell you that we are certain he plans to commit more acts of terrorism He committed brutal acts of destruction and murder and he must pay for those crimes. So, we're finally allies, Commander. Our time to intercept is two minutes, fourteen seconds. If I may take this opportunity to say that I warned you (Sisko ends the transmission)
