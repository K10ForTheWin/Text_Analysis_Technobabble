I am Koloth. (William Campbell himself. Just don't challenge him to a duel.) Yes. It does. What are the charges against him? You must be a very brave man to attempt humour at the expense of a Klingon Dahar Master. Kor! You disgrace yourself and our purpose. I do not go into battle with one whose honour is washed away in breshtanti ale. Keep him! [Ops] A sharp knife is nothing without a sharp eye. I see the Federation insults us by sending a Lieutenant to greet us. Dax? This is a mistake. Kang must not have known. You are no one's godfather. Brother! Ha! Are you certain that he's still there? She's right. The traders may already have warned him that we are coming. Curzon Dax was a politician. It was a diplomatic ploy for him to bond himself to us in a blood oath. Are you? (pause) I am practicing here. Leave while you can. You? Your presence will jeopardise the rest of us. Leave me! Ah, a warrior's configuration. Now what are you going to do with it? And if my hand should slip, and you should die? Stand up. Your presence against the Albino will do honour to our cause. Nothing that won't get us all killed before we reach battle. Come. Any information about the position of the sentries? She may be right. Or to a glorious death. Come on, old comrade. For the last time, let's sharpen our blades. (Kor and Koloth leave) Yes, and he plans to detonate it the moment we enter the compound. Wait here. I'm going to find out if he's inside. I'll ask somebody. (Koloth marches off) I encountered a helpful lookout. The Albino is inside. He's in there now, but the moment we attack, he will move to a secured command post here. I didn't see him coming. I will not die before you, you thunderous bulk.
