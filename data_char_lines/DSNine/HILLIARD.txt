Commander Hilliard here. Of course. You wouldn't mind answering a few questions? Now you've requested Security Chief Odo's medical records from Stardate? And you state that he has contracted the morphogenic virus that's infected the Founders. How did he contract it? You're saying that he's been in contact with the enemy? I assume that you've done your own scans of Odo over the years? Then why do you need ours? A cure? No. No, that pretty much covers it. I'm afraid those files are classified. No, no, you misunderstood. I can't release those files to anyone that doesn't have Sigma Nine Clearance. I fail to see why you're so determined to cure a disease that infects our enemy. We're at war, Doctor. Odo, who by your own admission has been known to consort with the enemy. I don't care about the circumstances. If you find a cure, there's a good chance it'll fall into Dominion hands. That's a risk that Starfleet Medical is not willing to take. Request for the files is denied. Now if I were you, I'd drop this matter, otherwise I'll have to refer it to Starfleet Security. [Replimat]
