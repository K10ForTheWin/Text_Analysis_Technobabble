As many as last time. And Starfleet is still waiting for your signature on these repair requests. I look forward to that day with great anticipation. Until then (Worf enters.) Kor, here, on our ship. No. (to Kor) It's an honour to have you aboard. Of course he was! Forgive the ignorance of these children. Tell the tale. If you'll excuse me, I have duties to attend to. The food is for me. I haven't eaten in hours. Men of our generation never stood on ceremony. We ate when we were hungry, we fought when we were angered. Oh, I miss the simplicity of those days. The warriors on this ship, they don't know what they've missed. But such is the way with children. They often let the promise of the future obscure the glories of the past. Only that they are children. Even Martok who, for all his flaws, is a great man, even Martok is but a child compared to you or me. They are quick to judge and slow to forgive. They still have much to learn. We are being pursued by a Jem'Hadar fleet. Worf believes he can stop them with a single ship. It's a good plan, but it has one flaw. It depends entirely on Worf successfully engaging the whole enemy fleet, if only for a short time. Perhaps. But it would take a man with three times his experience to accomplish such a feat. And such a man would have to be certain of his abilities. It has been an honour serving with you, Kor, son of Rynar. [Klingon Corridor] If they succeed, you can drink to their courage, and if they fail, you can still drink to their courage. (sings) Mi' qul qar'a, 'ej Do' QI'la'.
