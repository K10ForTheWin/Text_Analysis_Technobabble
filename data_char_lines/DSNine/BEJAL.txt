You must be very excited. I mean, to be a part of a potentially history-making project. After we launch our target drone, the Defiant will have to generate a subspace tensor matrix in the twenty five to thirty thousand Cochrane range. Then the drone will send out a magneton pulse which should react with the matrix to create an opening in the space-time continuum. Excellent. Target drone is in position, Commander. The plasma coil interlocks are in place. Deflector grid is charged and standing by. Hmm? What are you trying to say? Then don't. We're ready to generate the tensor matrix. (Lenara and Dax swap places.) The tensor matrix is forming. The distortion's becoming coherent. It's working. You couldn't ask for a better beginning. But it all comes down to the next test. We have to be able to send an object through the wormhole to prove that it's stable for space travel. I didn't know you'd talked to Dax since we got back. Where? How long did she stay? I don't want to ask you anything, but I'm beginning to wonder if I should. Believe it. People are starting to notice. Doctor Pren saw you holding hands at dinner the other night. I thought he was overreacting, but then I saw the way the two of you were acting on the Defiant. (Lenara walks off) Lenara! [Promenade] Lenara. Lenara! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, I'm your brother. You tell me nothing's going on, then nothing's going on. I just want to hear you say it. All right. [Dax's quarters] (Dax is doing slow sit-ups when the doorbell rings.) Target drone is in position. The tensor matrix is starting to form. Wormhole neutrino readings are stable. I'm reading a massive plasma leak in the Engine room. Much better. She's almost fully recovered. I want to thank you for what you did. Lenara means a lot to me. Yes. I'll leave you two alone. (Bejal leaves. Dax opens her hand to reveal a small gift.)
