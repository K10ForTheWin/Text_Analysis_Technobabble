Because my business here is crucial. It demands immediate attention. And as a member of the Cardassian Central Command I must assure you, Commander, that what we have to discuss is most crucial indeed. Please, Commander, your efforts are appreciated but unnecessary. You see, Central Command has learned that Gul Dukat was the leader of a small group of misguided officers who were funnelling weapons to our colonies in the Demilitarised zone. Dukat and the others were operating entirely without our knowledge. Central Command would never sanction anything that would violate our treaty with the Federation. We've arrested Dukat's co-conspirators and they shall be dealt with accordingly. With the Maquis, where he belongs. I assume the Maquis will execute him for his crimes. Well then, I don't see what difference it makes whether we do it or they do it. I can assure you, Commander, that there shall be no retaliation. The Cardassians have no desire to go to war again with the Federation. You have my word. I hoped you would. Thank you, Commander, but I too must attend to my business. Besides, I am afraid this place has lost its charm since the last time I was here. (Parn leaves through the airlock)
