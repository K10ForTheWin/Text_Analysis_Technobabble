I serve the Founders in all things. Thot Pran, I look forward to working with you and the Breen Confederacy. But what about the Klingons and the Romulans and (gets a Look) I meant no disrespect. I was simply asking a question.
Founder. I've heard a disturbing rumour about the traitor Damar. He may be alive. They say he's here on Cardassia Prime. In the capital, no less. He won't be for long. [Cardassian alley] (Dead of night. Damar and Garak sneak along, then a light is shone at Garak.) Founder, I'm relieved to see that you're all right. I'm afraid it was sabotage. We captured some of the terrorists, but they're not soldiers. They're ordinary citizens. (She grabs Broca by the throat.) I'm sure it's only a small number of malcontents. Severely punished. (She lets him go.) Founder, our troops have captured the traitor Damar. And there's more. Colonel Kira and Garak have been apprehended with him. If I could talk to the rebels, get them to change their minds. Exactly. Me, betray you? Never! Wait! You're making a terrible mistake. But I've done everything you've asked! I tell you I'm loyal. I believe in the Dominion! No! Wait! No! (Broca is hauled out of the room.) You're making a terrible mistake. I'm not a traitor! Please, just let me speak to the Founder. No, wait! (The Jem'Hadar bayonet their prisoners.)
