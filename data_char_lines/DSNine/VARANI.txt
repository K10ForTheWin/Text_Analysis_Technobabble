Having my work appreciated again, I've almost forgotten how it feels. One can't be choosy about performance venues these days. A little less exhibition hall and a little more music hall, is that it? I think I can accommodate him. Have you spoken to Minister Bolka about my idea to rebuild the Jalanda Forum? You must keep trying. Bajorans must reclaim their artistic heritage if they ever hope to regain their sense of self-worth. I hope I'm not intruding. She exaggerates, but that's why I'm so fond of her. Being a Bajoran, I know what it's like to be displaced. As a token of friendship, I would like to give you this. (A hologram of a younger man playing - same base projector style as Tasha Yar's farewell speech.) It's from a concert I played many years ago at the Jalanda Forum. [Guest quarters] (Haneek puts the holoprojector on the table as Tumak comes in) Major, if I may have a moment. I know. With Minister Rozahn and Vedek Sorad. I presume Haneek will be there as well. Please tell her my heart goes out to her and her people. Tell her how much Bajorans everywhere regret having to refuse their request. Am I? You know what the provisional government's answer is going to be. I know, and I wish there was some way we could help them. But Bajor is in shambles, Kira. You know that as well as I do.
