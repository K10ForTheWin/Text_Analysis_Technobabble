My name is Henry Garcia. I've been living here two years now. I came to San Francisco to work in a brewery but they laid a bunch of us off because they got some new equipment. So I ended up here. I've never been in trouble with the law or anything. I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want a chance to work and live like regular people.
