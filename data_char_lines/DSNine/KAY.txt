(Nana Visitor) Voila. A pitcher of plain water instantly becomes a pitcher of iced tea. Oh, H. G. Wells would've liked it. The battle of the doughnuts, round twenty eight. A draw, same as always. What's that? Benny has the new issue of Galaxy. Hmm, what do you think, Jules? Oh, you've got to be kidding. Write back and tell them we look like writers. Poor, needy and incredibly attractive. Of course I can. God forbid that the public ever finds out K.C. Hunter is a woman. The world needs more people like you. Science fiction needs more strong women characters. I'm always saying that, aren't I, Jules? Uh oh, he's angry now. Might as well write it in chalk on the sidewalk. More people would read them that way. On what? Well, obviously someone, er, someone without a lot of hope. A shoeshine boy, a convict, someone dreaming of a better future. Let him get this one published first, then he can worry about the others. What about, It Came From Outer Space. We're waiting for his return with baited breath. We heard they beat the hell out of you. Nothing? He sells a novel to Gnome Press and he says it's nothing. Take it easy, Benny.
