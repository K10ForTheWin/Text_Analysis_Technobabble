Oh, let's just say I miss the old days on Bajor. Smuggling might not have been the safest line of work, but it was a lot more exciting than selling scrap metal. (Everyone say Hi! to  Roy Brocksmith, previously seen as Kolrami in  Peak Performance) I picked up a lead on the Ravinok. Last time it was just a rumour. This time I have evidence, a fragment of metal. Looks like it's part of the forward sensor array. Sorry. I'm afraid I can't leave the Badlands right now. Important business. You understand. Let's just say it'd be better if you came to me. There's only one way for you to find out. I'll be waiting. [Security office]
