Oh, let's just say I miss the old days on Bajor. Smuggling might not have been the safest line of work, but it was a lot more exciting than selling scrap metal. (Everyone say Hi! to  Roy Brocksmith, previously seen as Kolrami in  Peak Performance) I picked up a lead on the Ravinok. Last time it was just a rumour. This time I have evidence, a fragment of metal. Looks like it's part of the forward sensor array. Sorry. I'm afraid I can't leave the Badlands right now. Important business. You understand. Let's just say it'd be better if you came to me. There's only one way for you to find out. I'll be waiting. [Security office] I bought it off a Ferengi scrap metal merchant. (Dukat scans it) Why didn't you tell me you were bringing him along? Too bad. The Maquis would've paid handsomely to get their hands on him. The voice of the new Cardassia, so compassionate, so understanding. Almost makes you forget that five years ago he was working Bajorans to death in forced labour camps and shooting anybody who tried to stop him. Almost makes you forget. No, but I was curious so I bribed one of his crewmembers. Turns out his last trip was to the Dozaria system. Barely class M. He found that in orbit. Just let me know what you find out. Lorit was my friend too. (Later, en route.)
