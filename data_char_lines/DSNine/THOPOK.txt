Hear this, Ferengi. Help Grilka and you live. Fail and I will kill you myself. (This is  Phil Morris, who was in Miri and ST3) [Ops] This consorting with a Ferengi is outrageous! No! (Thopok throws the table over and Quark with it.) Forgive me, mistress, but I cannot watch this any longer. I will not protect a House where you are welcome, Ferengi. You are a coward and a liar and you have no honour. So tomorrow you will kill me, or I will kill you. [O'Brien's quarters] Where did you learn to fight with a bat'leth? Well? It has no place here! Get on with it. [Holosuite] End it!
