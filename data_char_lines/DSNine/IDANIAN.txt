You're Security Chief Odo? I'm here about the communication you sent to the Idanian government. Where's Arissa? Is she safe? Better than she knows herself. She's not who she seems to be. She's an intelligence agent with my government. She was sent to infiltrate Draim's organisation. She doesn't know. We gave her a new identity before we sent her in. All her previous memories were removed and stored on the datacrystal. If you take me to her, I'll explain the rest. [Science lab] (O'Brien is on the floor, groaning. A deputy is out cold.) The datacrystal, where is it? That crystal is Arissa. It generates a distinctive signal. We might be able to track it. [Cargo bay] I've lost it. The crystal's quantum signature starts to fade after a few minutes. [Cargo bay] Don't move. (Odo hits Sorm anyway.) She volunteered for the operation two years ago. After we altered her memories, we placed her on Finnea. She woke up the next morning believing she was a different person. That was crucial to the plan. Draim employs telepaths to scan everyone who works for him. It was the only way to get past them. We left her in place long enough to become a trusted member of Draim's organisation. When we were ready to recall her, we had Tauvid make contact. We'd imprinted a trace memory designed to make her feel she could trust him. That way, she'd agree to meet. With what she knows about Draim, we're going to be able to cripple his entire organisation. As soon as she's debriefed, we plan to issue the indictments. She knew the risks when she volunteered. We did everything we could to minimise them. Every stage of this operation was meticulously planned. If Draim's people had monitored the transmission, it would have compromised the entire operation. We couldn't risk it. All that matters is that she's safe and that Draim is going to prison for a long time.
