I am Vedek Latha Mabrin and I welcome you to the Calash Retreat. Today we begin prayer and meditation as preparation for our Days of Atonement. May the Prophets walk with us as we begin our journey. (They sit around a large ornamental lamp. Latha lights it from a candle and sits. The lamp sends a beam of light out to each monk, then five go out, leaving the one on Latha. Then a weapon beam from the lamp shoots him.) [Infirmary]
