We're beyond their sensor range. Course laid in. We'll be in the Badlands in six hours. (Riker removes his sideburns, and we realise who he is.) You did it, Tom. Kalita to Riker. We've reached the rendezvous point. The other Maquis ships just arrived. All defence systems online and operational. Warp power standing by. Course already laid in. We're approaching the security perimeter, Tom. We'll be in Cardassian sensor range in five minutes. [War room] We're past the security perimeter, out of their sensor range. Right. We've lost main power and the cloak is offline. Warp eight, aye sir. They're coming around for another pass. There are nine Galor-class cruisers about six light years away. No. The Kraxon is pursuing but they won't catch us before we reach Orias. Direct hit on the cruiser's port nacelle. Their shields are down by thirty percent. (Boom) Their defence systems are offline and they've lost main power. Incoming message from Cardassia Prime. It's Gul Dukat and Commander Sisko. We're one hundred million kilometres from the Kraxon. All stop. (The little ship parks itself above the big warship.) [War room] They're moving off. They've set course back to the Orias System.
