Bilby. I've brought someone here to meet you. (He steps to one side to reveal a hidden fourth person.) Bilby, who is this? I've never seen him before. How well do you know him? Then it's settled. Bilby witnessed for him. That's all that's necessary. I told you. Don't let me down. My love to your family. (And the visitors beam out.) I can see that. Bilby, not right now. This isn't a social visit. What does it look like? Not now. I said not now. Let's just say he conducted some business on the side and neglected to pay his fare. It's a good thing you never witnessed for him or you'd be lying there too, Bilby. We mentioned we might ask you to do something for us. We want you to assassinate the Klingon Ambassador to Farius. If something goes wrong and you're captured, you never met our friend here. I knew I could count on you.
