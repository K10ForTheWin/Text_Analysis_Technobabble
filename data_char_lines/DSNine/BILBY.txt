(looks human) I don't know. And don't you mean what are we going to do? (Everyone say Hi! to  Nick Tate, my favourite Eagle pilot.) I'll figure something out. I said I'll figure it out. I'm hungry. No. Last time that gave me heartburn. I eat when I'm hungry. And when I'm hungry, I eat fast. Don't get your hopes up. (A Yridian approaches the bar's comm. booth.) Hey, we're using that comm. booth. Go. Order some nozala sandwiches. (Krole has a dataport fitted, and uses it to hack the system.) Get them to deliver some extra vilm sauce. I don't care who pays for it, just so as long as it isn't us. Krole! You all right? They spiked him. They spiked him over a free lunch. What's this city coming to? Don't you mean what is Krole going to do? Are you saying you can fix it? On what? Do you know who I am? Well if you did, you wouldn't ask that. Listen, Mister? I've seen you around here these last few weeks. You're always in here, tinkering around with one piece of junk or another, which tells me that things are not going too well for you. Now, here's my advice to you. Give them to me. You take these. You bring them back tomorrow morning fixed and polished. Did you fix it? Feedback gives him a headache. Very impressive. You know, if I was a suspicious man I might ask myself how a tinkerer living in one room on Jinami Street managed to fix such a complicated piece of hardware so quickly. I know a lot about you. Maybe more than you want me to. Come with me. For a walk. [Bilby's apartment] Have a seat. Not there. (A cat leaps onto the chair. There's a picture of a woman and children on a table.) Chester doesn't like people sitting in his chair. Don't touch anything. (Bilby opens a safe and fetches a Klingon disruptor rifle.) Something wrong? Did you think I brought you here to kill you? Why would I kill somebody that can fix things for me? I guess a man that's been knocked around as much as you have is always expecting the worst, huh? Yeah, that was a tough break on Dayos Four. Two years for dealing in stolen goods? Who's to say he'd have told you the truth. Take this, for example. My employer asked me to get three Klingon disruptors for him. Did the man I bought them from tell me they didn't work? No, he did not. Have a look. Can you fix it? I'm glad to hear it. It's going to make my employer very happy. I didn't ask him. When Raimus tells you to do something, you just do it. You hungry? Have some cake. My wife sent it. Go ahead. (O'Brien takes a piece. It crunches when he bites into it.) Yeah, she makes it herself. This is her. These are my children. They're in New Sydney. I'd love to have them here on Farius, but considering the business I'm in, it's not a good idea. You got a family? You should. It's the most important thing. I send them everything. I pay my fare to Raimus, the rest goes straight to my wife. Yeah, to Raimus, every month. That's the way it works. He's above me in the organisation. You do know what organisation I'm referring to, don't you. Good. Krole and Flith, the gentlemen you met earlier, they're below me. If you fix these disruptors for me, you could be lucky, too. Don't misunderstand. I'm not promising anything. I just need to be sure I can trust you first. Have some more cake. I thought you said you were hungry. What's the matter? Don't you like my wife's cake? So answer me. Do you like my wife's cake? You're right. It is. Had you wondering which way to jump, didn't I? You know, Krole and Flith, they always act as if it's the best thing they ever tasted. Hey, what do you make of that, Chester? I've found me an honest man. Must be my lucky day. [Alley] Contact Raimus. Tell him we have the disruptors. Good job. Tell us where you got the parts. We can always use a good contact. Why not? I don't care about your supplier. I'm asking the question. Where did you get the parts! You stole them? Why didn't you just say so? You lied to me because you didn't want me to be implicated? Did you hear that? He's willing to protect me if he gets caught. Try hard as I may, I can't imagine either of you willing to do that. Hey, you know something? I think it's time we did something about the way you look. (Time passes and O'Brien shaved and in a new green suit. The silent bartender is watching it all.) Now that's more like it. I think you look great, Connolly. What do you think, Krole? What are you talking about? I took him to the same tailor that I use. That's right. Well if I was, I wouldn't buy anything from a man that sold me three useless disruptors. I thought I did. I want my money back. Let me get something straight. You're telling me there was nothing wrong with this when you sold it to me? Well, maybe I just don't know how to work it. What do you know? I figured it out. (Bilby increases the power level.) Do you know what would've happened if I'd given Raimus three useless disruptors? He'd have killed me. Why would I want my money back? It works fine now. (Bilby kills Yint.) [Bilby's apartment] (Thunder and lightning outside, but the cat doesn't flinch.) No one takes me for a fool. I'll do whatever it takes to protect what I have. This life, it isn't for everyone. Sometimes I wish I could just get away from it all. But what would I do with myself? I'm too old to start over. Besides, who am I to complain? The organisation's given me opportunities I never thought I'd have. Once you're part of it, once you're accepted, there's no limit to what you can do if you're smart about it. Glad you're paying attention. I mean, we've got people everywhere. Even on Earth. Hell, we've even got a man in Starfleet. That's correct. Hey, would you do me a favour? Would you remind me to pick up a present for my daughter tomorrow? She's got a birthday coming up. I want to be there. Sure hope I can make it. It wasn't me, it was Raimus. Hey, do you want to come to New Sydney with me? Meet my family? What's with all the questions? A double-agent? Then why would he have given us the names of all their undercover operatives? Don't worry, he's the real thing. Raimus met him when he was vacationing on Risa last year. Mister Starfleet was in charge of the weather control system. Raimus offered him a very substantial amount of money to make it stop raining. It's Krole. Raimus wants to see me. Raimus. He's someone I know. I know him. That's right. You can count on me. I won't. Do you know what I just did for you? I witnessed for you. If anything happens, I'm accountable. Good. [Alley] Come on! (Krole disconnects himself.) I was thinking about opening an account there. One with better security. [Bilby's apartment] (There's a young working woman sitting on the bed.) What do you think? But what? What do you mean, you don't want to? I brought her here for you. But what? Don't tell me you don't like girls? Since when? That's great. Why didn't you say anything? Listen, I understand. But that's no reason to hurt this girl's feelings. So who is she? This new girl? Where'd you meet her? Well, bring her by sometime. I'd like to meet her. A man your age, you should settle down and have a family. It's the most important thing. You let me talk to her for three minutes, I'll let you know if she's the marrying kind. I can read people right away. What's in their hearts. You, for instance. I saw through you the first time I laid eyes on you. I don't think I've ever seen anyone so alone in my entire life. I said to myself, that man, he doesn't have a friend in the quadrant. Flith and Krole, they thought you were a snake. But I knew better. When you came back the next day with that dataport repaired, that's when I knew we're going to do great things together. I'm about to take a step up in the organisation. Raimus is giving me an opportunity and I'm going to make the best of it. Everything's changing. I can feel it. It all started when you came along. You changed my luck. I'm going to take care of you. I don't forget my friends, because friends, they're like family. Nothing's more important. Nothing. [Alley] Good morning, Graife. (Graife the bartender glances over to Raimus and the Vorta.) Raimus. I didn't know you were coming. Well, let me get you something. Graife, make us a strong pot of I wouldn't know. Raimus, what's this all about? Raimus. But. Raimus, this is crazy. He doesn't know what he's talking about. (The bartender shoots Flith in the back.) Yeah. (Graife removes the corpse.) Yeah, whatever you need. All right. Connelly! I understand. Here you go, Chester. (Doorbell.) Who could that be? (Guess who.) Did you come to see me off? Have to wait. I was just leaving. What are you talking about? Why not? That's impossible. I saw you access the grid. You cut off the trace. You're panicking. Try not to worry so much. They're not going to catch me. How do you know that? I suppose you work for them. Very good. You had me. I mean, just for a minute there I actually thought you were working for Starfleet. Come on, That's enough. You had me. I admit it. That's enough! I don't want to hear it. Do you understand me? I don't want to hear it. Why'd you have to come here? Why'd you have to tell me that? I'm dead already. Can't you see that? I witnessed for you. Do you have any idea what that means? There's no hiding from the Syndicate. You know that. No! They'd go after my family. They'd make an example of me. Raimus may leave them alone if he thinks that I died not knowing about you. What choice do I have? How did I let this happen? I should have known. You were too good to be true. I wanted so much to believe that my luck had changed, I didn't see it. I didn't see it. I wasn't even your target. I suppose I'm not important enough. I've always known something like this might happen. The smart thing would be to kill you, but I guess I've already proved I'm not too smart. You'll never know how little comfort that is. If it's not too much trouble, will you make sure Chester is looked after? Be good. Mind I ask you something? Back home, wherever that is, do you have a family? Good. It's the most important thing. (Bilby goes to meet his fate.) O'Brien's quarters]
