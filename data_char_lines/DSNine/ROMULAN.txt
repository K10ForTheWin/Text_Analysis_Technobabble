Yes, we destroyed the Flaxian's ship. Why should we hide it? Retaya was wanted for crimes against the Romulan Empire. His execution was perfectly legal. I have nothing to corroborate that, though it wouldn't surprise me. That would be Mister Garak. A cobbler, I believe. I'll correct our records. That is, if he's still alive. Well, is there anything else? Nearly a year. Why? We're just grateful to have found him at all. Now, if you're finished, Commander, I have other matters to attend to. (transmission ends.)
Bridge to Colonel Lovok. We've entered the Omarion Nebula and dropped out of warp. We should be in orbit of the planet in fifteen minutes.
(woman) They're releasing him from isolation.
All clear. Visitors. Wait. The guards are still too close. Clear. (Bashir opens the panel and Garak is quickly out.) Jem'Hadar. No time. (Three Jem'Hadar enter.) My people have a saying. Never turn your back on a Breen. [Crawlspace]
Thank you, Doctor.
Our vessels are of a different design. Can this technique be adapted to protect them as well? What have we come to? With the Breen, the Cardassians and the Jem'Hadar, you're still outnumbered twenty to one. For how long? They can't keep them at bay forever. What's left of them. Half his troops were killed in their assault on Rondac. Does the rebellion have a chance of succeeding?
