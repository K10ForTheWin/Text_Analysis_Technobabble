And to you, Commander. I trust you're in good health. Things are going well on the station? That's wonderful. I'm told you've performed a special service for Bajor today. Congratulations to you. You're not holding a certain Cardassian for us? By temporarily, you mean until you're satisfied that a verified identification has been made. I fully understand your concerns, Commander, but since our Major Kira's accepted responsibility in this matter, the burden is off your shoulders. Commander, if this Marritza was at Gallitep, we want him, and we will have him. Is that clear? Good. We'll chat again soon. Good day, Commander. [Replimat]
