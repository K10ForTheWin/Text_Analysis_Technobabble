All Cardassian prisoners step forward. (seven of them) I am pleased to announce that the hostilities between our peoples have ended. As of today, Cardassia has joined the Dominion. Therefore, you're all being sent home. Congratulations on your new status as Dominion citizens. Not you, Mister Garak. You're staying. But not a very popular one, I'm afraid. At least not with the head of the new Cardassian government. Gul Dukat. [Cardassia] Fascinating. Even after all he's been through, the Klingon still thirsts for battle. Doesn't he ever tire of it? You fight because that is what you were designed to do. All that motivates him is some barbaric sense of honour. Finish this. (Worf gets knocked down again) [Barracks] (The soldier peers into the crawlspace.) What are you waiting for? End this. You heard him. (Worf cannot stand, and Ikat'ika is breathing hard.) You what? Shoot them both. [Crawlspace]
