Nassuc was the best officer I ever had. I took her out of the ranks and made her a general. In time, she would have inherited my entire empire. And how did she pay me back? By declaring independence for her homeworld. Most arms dealers wouldn't understand such considerations. They have no ideals, no passions except for lining their own pockets. I always felt you were a man of honour. You're all men of honour. I want to make an example of Nassuc and her followers. I intend to eradicate her entire city. Seven or eight million. But that's just the beginning. Over the next couple of months, I would like the death toll to rise slowly but steadily. About twenty million. (Quark is shocked at this idea.) I am here to buy weapons. Are you here to sell them? Open it. What's wrong? Hagath, what's she doing here?
