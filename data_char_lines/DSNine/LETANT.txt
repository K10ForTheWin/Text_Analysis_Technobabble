(Romulan) Really, Captain, I see no reason why I should sit here and allow this Klingon jackal to call me a coward. You see my point? If we invade Cardassia now, all we'll do is count our dead. (to aide) Notice the primitive rage in his eye, the uncontrolled brutality. Klingons can be quite entertaining, can't they? Every Romulan zoo should have a pair. Yes, I have. And I continue to find them premature. Let the Dominion continue to send its fleets against us and we will annihilate them one by one. It is where he belongs. So, it would appear that your weak spot is about to become much stronger. And leave it to a Klingon to leap to the wrong conclusion. The Romulan Empire has agreed to join the invasion of Cardassia and we live up to our agreements. The only question is, can the invasion be launched before the defensive grid is activated? Romulans don't believe in luck.
