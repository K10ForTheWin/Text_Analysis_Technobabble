Legate? The Obsidian Order and the Central Command have been given too much power over our lives. We're going to change that. Your father is a great man. He has everything any Cardassian could want, yet he's willing to risk his life for what he believes. Legate, I have to get your daughter to our next contact. Sir, we have to go now. Central Command would never allow it. No! (Entek kills Ari)
