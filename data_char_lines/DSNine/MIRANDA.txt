(a red-headed woman) Welcome to Gaia, Captain Sisko. We've been expecting you. Miranda O'Brien. This settlement was founded by the crew of a Starfleet vessel that crashed on this planet two centuries ago. I realise this is going to be hard for you to accept but that ship was the Defiant. Two days from now, when you leave here and try to pass through the energy barrier, you'll be thrown back in time two hundred years. You'll be stranded here and become the founders of this settlement. We are your descendents. (After the opening credits.) And a Tannenbaum, too. Why don't we go inside? You can meet some of the others later. We still have a lot to talk about. [Meeting hall] (A ships viewscreen and a fireplace. A virtual Quark is giving maths lesson 916 on the viewscreen to two young girls.) This is our meeting hall, which as you can see, we sometimes use as a schoolroom. Molly, this is your grandfather's great great great grandfather. Girls, why don't you run along and help your parents? It's almost time for planting and there's a lot of work to be done. He has your eyes. It would've been a good crop this year. Spring came so early. It's nothing you need to worry about. (Worf is by a fire.) Come on, Gabriel, there isn't much time. Put some of this on your face. The sun's strong today. Here's one for you. Molly, take that from the bottom. I don't know how to thank you for what you're doing.
