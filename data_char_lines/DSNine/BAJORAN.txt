Emissary, I've come a long way to see you. This moment is sacred, one that will be long remembered. Meeh rak Dorah Pah wran. Ee toi Velah slah. Pah wran amar. Pah wran Evak to. The Emissary is wise. Your work is finished. The Orb you are seeking, the Orb of the Emissary? You're never going to find it. (Jake knocks the attacker out with a sack, presumably of clams.)
This is Bajoran Control. Please transmit your identification code and flight plan. Bajoran Control to Yukon. You are cleared to enter the system and proceed to Deep Space Nine.
I'm sorry, Major, but you're wasting your time. His orders were quite clear. He doesn't want to see anyone. Not until his guest has left. As far as I know, the female changeling has not left his quarters for three days. Perhaps it would be best if you left. My colleague over here takes his duties very seriously. I promise to tell Odo you were here.
This way, Eminence.
Thank you, Doctor. (The Bajoran officer leaves) Commander, I have the report you asked for on those weapon scanners. I really think you should see this, sir. (The Bajoran brings the thing Bashir gave him up toward Sisko's neck.) No. (Sisko punches him around Ops and down into the pit)
Minister Jaro on subspace, sir.
He isn't one of anything. He's the one who caught Ibudan for them. You're right. We ought to talk to Major Kira. We want the shape-shifter!
You should have won.
