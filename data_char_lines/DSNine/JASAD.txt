I am Gul Jasad of the Cardassian Guard, Seventh Order. Where is our warship? What wormhole? Our sensors show no indication of a wormhole in this sector. What? You expect me to believe that someone created a wormhole, and now conveniently has disassembled it? We do not accept your explanation. Somehow you have destroyed our warship. We demand the unconditional surrender of this space station or we will open fire. You have one hour. (Transmission ends) This is your answer? Defend it? Your space station could not defend itself against one Cardassian warship. What are their defences? When did they receive these armaments? And how did they install them without our knowledge? Somehow they have created a massive illusion of duranium shadows. It is! So can Starfleet. [Ops]
