Doctor. We've just reached an agreement that will allow you to retain both your commission and your medical practice. It was your father's suggestion, Doctor. He pleads guilty to illegal genetic engineering and in exchange you stay in the service. I don't think so. Two hundred years ago we tried to improve the species through DNA resequencing, and what did we get for our trouble? The Eugenics Wars. For every Julian Bashir that can be created, there's a Khan Singh waiting in the wings. A superhuman whose ambition and thirst for power have been enhanced along with his intellect. The law against genetic engineering provides a firewall against such men and it's my job to keep that firewall intact. I've made my offer. Do you accept? Then report to my office at Starfleet Headquarters once you arrive on Earth. (Transmission ends.)
