Ambassador, Commander Sisko is attempting to escape. We are in pursuit. Confirmed. Commander Sisko is hailing us. The runabout is turning. It's heading back in our direction. He's preparing to fire. Shields employed. He's aiming his vessel straight for us. Ambassador, sensors indicate the other runabout is no longer in orbit. I don't know. It's gone. I'm picking up a warp signature. They could have transported to the other runabout while our sensors were down.
