Those pips look good on you, Captain. Though to be honest, I'm not really here for the ceremony. Our intelligence reports indicate there's been a coup d'Ã©tat on the Tzenkethi homeworld. I know I won't. Unfortunately, it's too early to tell who's in control, but we don't want to take any chances. We need to remind the Tzenkethi that the Federation is committed to protecting our colonies near their border. Exactly. The Defiant will leave in two days on a week-long patrol. I'll be coming along as an observer. I've heard a lot about the Defiant. I'm looking forward to seeing her in operation. With a fine crew. Now what do you say we get back to the party? Captain. And those particles would still be detectable on the saboteur? Certainly.
