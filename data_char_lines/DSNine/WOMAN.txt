Please, Sirah, for my daughter. It would mean so much. Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Help me.
Really?
You're lucky. We had to cancel our trip to the Alps this year because of the student protests in France. They're not having any more luck that the Gaullists did. Well, at least we don't have to worry about that kind of thing here. So, who mugged you? Did you see them? I thought they stopped doing that.
Thank you.
Salutatorian? Fascinating. There'll be another time. (O'Brien and Bashir start to leave)
Molly? (Molly runs off, O'Brien goes over to Sisko and Kira.)
Help us! Something is happening to us!
He's something.
Someone help him. Call an ambulance. [Infirmary]
Can I have some service please? How long does it take? I've been waiting forever.
Here he comes!
No, no, please. (The guards start removing prisoners)
