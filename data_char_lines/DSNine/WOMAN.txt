Help us! Something is happening to us!
Salutatorian? Fascinating. There'll be another time. (O'Brien and Bashir start to leave)
Please, Sirah, for my daughter. It would mean so much. Oh, thank you. Thank you.
You're lucky. We had to cancel our trip to the Alps this year because of the student protests in France. They're not having any more luck that the Gaullists did. Well, at least we don't have to worry about that kind of thing here. So, who mugged you? Did you see them? I thought they stopped doing that.
Help me.
Really?
Thank you.
No, no, please. (The guards start removing prisoners)
Here he comes!
Molly? (Molly runs off, O'Brien goes over to Sisko and Kira.)
He's something.
Someone help him. Call an ambulance. [Infirmary]
Can I have some service please? How long does it take? I've been waiting forever.
