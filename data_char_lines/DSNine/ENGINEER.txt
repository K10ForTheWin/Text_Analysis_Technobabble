Aye, Captain.
What are you two doing here? Scotty told me to do this. It's on the duty roster. Isn't that a medical tricorder? Why do we need a doctor to repair a power relay? Oh. So, where should we start? No problem. Hope you feel better. [K-7 bar] (Odo has changed tables and has something purring on his lap when Worf enters)
Engineering. Right away, Chief. Engineering. Will do.
