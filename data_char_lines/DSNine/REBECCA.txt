Michael, I wondered when you'd get here. There never were any missiles, no retaliatory strike against Cardassia. It was all a ploy, a way to let Michael know that we'd made it here. Michael, we don't have time for this. All right, you heard what Michael said. Stick together. [Maquis settlement] They landed three days ago. We tried to fight. I didn't think I'd make it either, but they kept all the leaders alive. They were going to make a present of us to the Cardassian government. Now I guess we'll end up in a Federation prison. I'm staying with you. Where's Michael? What do you mean, he's not coming?
