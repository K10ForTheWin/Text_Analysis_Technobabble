The Master told us you wouldn't approve of our ways. He said we should be patient with you. I don't understand why he brought you here. We all work very hard for what we have. We don't need you or anyone else to approve of us. Don't misunderstand. I hope you come to feel the love of the Pah wraiths. But if you don't, it's your loss. No offence. I know what I believe. No. (Others step up to form a protective wall in front of Dukat.) I only hope that Mika and I can live up to the faith you've shown in us. If I'd known, I would have. It is. We prayed together many times. He wanted to be sure. Yes. Yes. I'll stay with her if you want to go. This is his child. That's why you tried to kill Mika. (Benyan throws his pill at Dukat, and others follow.) False gods! (Dukat beams out and the crowd goes silent. Fala sits down and takes his pill.)
