Of course. O'Brien. It's been a long time. How're you doing? Is that a fact. Oh, about eight years now. I settled on Volan Three. Yes, the new treaty really puts us in harm's way, but I run a ladarium mining sluice. As long as the Cardassians need ladarium for their warp drives, they leave me alone. That's what got me out of Starfleet. I'm coming back for another supply pickup in a month or two. And I'm telling you I don't have any idea what you're talking about. Since when is that a crime? We're old friends from the Rutledge. Of course it does. I wish there were something I could do to help. I haven't done anything. I don't have anything to be worried about. What is this? What for? What are you talking about? What's that got to do with anything? I never got along with them. Look, this is none of your business.
