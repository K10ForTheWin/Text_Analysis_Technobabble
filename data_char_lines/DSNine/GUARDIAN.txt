We've been trying to get Dax back to the homeworld to perform the zhian'tara for some time now. She kept putting us off, so the Symbiosis Commission decided to force the issue and send me here. Where is the zhian'tara to take place? I have preparations to make. I'nora, ja'kala Dax. Ahian'shee Lela tanus rem. Gon'dar Jadzia tor. Jadzia, zhian'tara vok. Tu Dax, zhian'tani ress. Zhian'par, Lela garu'koj. (He places his hands behind Kira and Dax's heads, and something flows from Dax through him to Kira.) I have a few questions for both of you. I need to make sure the memory transference is complete. What is the last thing you remember? Can you tell me the name of the person who supervised Lela when she was an Initiate? That's perfectly all right. It just means Lela's memories have been temporarily removed from your mind. Excellent. The transference seems to be complete. Unless either of you has any questions, I'll leave you alone for a few hours. It's late. I think it's time we returned Doctor Bashir's body to him. Activate the forcefield. As will I. Jadzia, zhian'tara vok. Tu Dax, zhian'tani ress. Zhian'par, Odo garu'koj. (The energy crosses and Odo's face and hair transform into a Trill.) [Sisko's quarters] There's no way to remove Curzon's memories from Odo without his cooperation. He has to give them up willingly. It'll take some time for her to adjust to the new balance, but she'll be fine.
