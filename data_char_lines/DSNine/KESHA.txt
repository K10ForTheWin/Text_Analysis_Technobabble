Nice to meet you. Thanks. (The song finishes.) Out of what? A makara fizz. Oh. Well, what are you having? I'll have the same. Jake says you're going to be the first Ferengi captain in Starfleet. He also says you're quite a hero. Don't be so modest. Jake's not the only one. Everyone on the station Okay. What? No, I wasn't wondering about that About your, you know. No. Yes. I mean, I'm not trying to say anything I think we should leave, Jake. It's all my fault. I didn't mean to stare. I'm really sorry if I made you uncomfortable, Nog.
