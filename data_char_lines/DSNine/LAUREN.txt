Mind your manners, Doctor. Genetically engineered mutants. Can't you tell? You'd be surprised how well it works. She's just a little cataleptic. There. Don't you look pretty? He's right. Oh, so you're a surgeon now? She's afraid it's going to hurt. You're in good hands. Very good hands. Don't get your hopes up, Julian. It's over between the two of us. I have a new man in my life. That gorgeous little Ferengi. Jealous? That's so sweet. (Bashir takes Sarina's hand and she gets up. They walk out of the cargo bay.) Would you leave him alone. Patrick, it's where it's supposed to be. (Bashir enters with Sarina.) I don't think I've heard a more beautiful sound in my life. You look so different. Quiet. You're the one who's tone deaf. (scale) Do ray mi fa so la ti do. Much better. Do ray mi fa so la ti. Do ray me do ray me. Fa mi ray Do ray me do ray me fa. Isn't Nog handsome? You need to lighten the load. What if we found a way to manipulate subspace? Could be very messy. Oh, we're not invited, Jack. Just her. It's all right. Come on, Sarina. Let's get you dressed. (Bashir is pacing as the other men wait and watch him.) Sorry to keep you waiting. Come on out. Come on. (Sarina comes out in a dress, with her hair fastened back a little.) Am I good, or am I good? [Quark's] Oh really? Huh. How nice for you. Go on, Julian. Tell him. There's nothing you can do for us. We're too far gone. All right, Julian. Leave her here with us for a while. We'll see what we can do. We have to tell him. Let's go. [Corridor] That way. We have to talk to you. We don't know.
(sultry siren lounging on a couch) You know, the handsome one. I'm going to make the best of it. See the way he's looking at me? (Bashir's bio on a PADD) He's in love with me already. It's him. (Jack grabs the PADD and jumps on it.) Hello. I know what you're thinking, Julian, but I'm not that kind of girl. Tell me, Doctor, what kind of enhancements did your parents have done to you? He turned out all right. I turned you down, didn't I? Very good. And you didn't even use your fingers. He's a mutant, just like the rest of us. How'd you manage to hide it for so long? Thanks for scaring him off. [Sisko's quarters] (After dinner) We complained and two very cute Engineers came by and said there was nothing wrong. Too bad. Who's he? Ashamed is more like it. Looks like a man who doesn't sleep. Someone close to him. Not the king. He's still alive. Peace talks. Could be interesting. I don't know, but they're willing to give up a lot to get it. The mizinite deposits on Holna Four alone are enough to keep their shipyards running for years. Nothing on the first planet but some simple protozoids and trinucleic fungi. The second planet has some cormaline deposits, but they're common enough. Not that I can see. They wouldn't want to build a base there. It's not an optimum situation. It's a binary system, there's a lot of ionic interference. (Bashir reads Sarina's PADD) There's no evidence of anything like that. All those admirals. We need music. A waltz. (The Blue Danube starts up, and Patrick dances with an imaginary partner.) Care to dance? (Lauren actually gets up off her couch and dances with Bashir. Jack goes over to Sarina, who walks away.) Coward. I meant her. (Jack cuts in with Lauren then the doorbell rings.) The Chief doesn't like any of us, do you Chief? His wife's away. He misses his friend. It's all right, Julian, go play with your friend. We'll be fine. Yes, you do. You're not going to like it (Later) I was hoping you were going to find a flaw. It's kind of a relief, in a way. I mean, who wants to wave a white flag? How? They could take the Alpha Quadrant in a matter of weeks. There wouldn't be more than two billion casualties. So how do we contact the Dominion? [Guest quarters] Don't interfere, Julian. Are we supposed to thank you? Nine hundred billion people are going to die. Believe me, I wouldn't mind if our predictions turned out to be wrong. Jack's still furious, but I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye. (She kisses Bashir.)
