(a woman) First of all, I want you all to know that the provisional government has taken the Skrreeans' request for immigration very seriously. The debate in the Chamber of Ministers became quite heated at times. Though I suppose you could say that about all of our debates. Yes. I was sent here to tell you that the Ministers in accord with the Vedek Assembly have decided to deny the Skrreeans' request. I am sorry. After what the Cardassians did to our planet, we can barely take care of our own. It used to be, before the Cardassians got their hands on it. Under ideal circumstances, perhaps you could. But what if the circumstances aren't ideal? What if we go through another long winter? What if your crops fail? What if the famine that has been plaguing Bajor continues to spread? What then? I'm afraid we aren't. We ran a series of projections to see whether a Skrreean settlement could survive on the northwest peninsula. The results were not encouraging. Do you really think we could stand by and do nothing? We would feel obligated to help with food, with clothing, with whatever it would take. I'm afraid the decision of the provisional government is final. The Skrreea will have to find somewhere else to live.
