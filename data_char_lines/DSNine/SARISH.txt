Sarish Rez, the First Minister's adjutant. Don't forget to mention the transit subsidies you just allocated. Tell them they can expect the price of transport to Bajor to start dropping within a few months. And remember, enunciate. If Shakaar cancelled his public appearances every time someone threatened his life, he would never leave his office. I know all about the True Way and what they're capable of. Absolutely not. Nothing is going to keep Shakaar from meeting those delegates tomorrow. Bajor's effort to join the Federation hinges on what happens over the next few days. It will be. But I already know what he's going to say. I didn't know myself until a moment ago. It's not often that people get a chance to talk to the First Minister. Besides, have you ever met a Bajoran who didn't have a fervent opinion about everything from Prophetic interpretation to farm policy? Is that Vedek Tonsa? I hear he's an excellent springball player. I think I'll see if we can arrange a game. I'm terrible. But it will give me a chance to talk to him about supporting Shakaar in the Vedek Assembly. (Sarish moves off and Kira goes over to Odo.)
