(pregnant girl) Are you really a doctor? I've never met a doctor before. They say there's a woman in Nykalia who makes a medicine that helps people withstand the pain of quickening so they can live longer. I'd go there, but Nykalia's so far away. Not for another two months. We never know when the quickening will come. Ekoria. Did you come here to help us? I do. And I know others who would welcome it too. (to curious children.) Go. Go on. I'm sorry I can't offer you more space. Whatever you need. (Dax picks up a painting.) My husband did. He died last winter. It's what he imagined our world used to be like. He painted a mural similar to that on a building near here. He traded a good pair of boots for the paint he needed. He wanted to show people the way things were, he thought it might give them something to work toward. All right. What's happened? Is that a good thing? I hope you two are hungry. Good. (Ekoria takes jars from a case she had kept in the sideboard.) It was supposed to be. Nothing. Do you like Takana root tea? I've been saving it for the hospital, for my death. Something tells me I'm not going to need it anymore. [Ruined town] (Bashir is failing to get red-vein people to help his research.) I don't understand why you need people who've quickened to make your cure. He can help us. Listen to him. Does it matter? He can find a cure for us if we help him. What's wrong? Maybe you should go home. Maybe my people don't deserve your help. It's more than that. We've come to worship death. I used to wake up and look at myself in the mirror, and be disappointed that I hadn't quickened in my sleep. Going to Trevean seemed so much easier than going on living. Not since the baby. My little boy. Can your machines tell me what he's going to look like when he grows up? Maybe he'll look like his father. I want to be here for him. To hold his hand when he takes his first step. Kiss his knee when he scrapes it in a fall. Doctor? Dax wanted me to tell you that Epran's white blood count is up another twelve percent. It is? I do. I did from the start. I don't really know why. Me? I was just trying to be kind. It doesn't bother you? But death comes to everyone in the end. Kuka-who? What's that? Why were you so determined to keep him together? Where's Kukalaka now? He's going to take care of you. You're going to be all right. (The scanner makes the red veins spread.) His heart stopped. His heart stopped! I'm glad you got a chance to see it before you left. (She's quickened) I thought I'd make it. I really did. Don't be. You gave me hope. I haven't felt that since before my husband died. Goodbye. What is it? I'll wait. (And one morning.) What is that smell? As long as I don't have to drink it. I've been better. I'm not surprised. Feels like he's turning somersaults in there. I'll never make it that long. Two weeks. (And later, one night, Trevean is painting the salve on her lesions.) Trevean. Am I dead? No. He deserves a chance to live. Trevean means well. He's a kind man, in his own way. (And now Ekoria is giving birth.)
