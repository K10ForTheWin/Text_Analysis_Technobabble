No other crew. Standard Danube-class runabout. Some modification to the phaser array and shield generators. Science and medical officers are low priority targets. I submit we execute this one and use the other in a tactical exercise. Move. [Captain's office] Take the pain. Show Goran'Agar we're still Jem'Hadar. (Goran'Agar prods one soldier, who winces in pain.) What is this? How long will this take? Your escape plan was flawed. Even if you had killed the guard, you never would have reached the runabout. I know. You're not like the other human. You don't like helping us. (A little sign lights up in the cavity - transporter power on line.) Good. I don't like it either. Slowly. Now put it down. (Arak'Taral bends down to check the cylinder and O'Brien jams a power cable into the cylinder's former connection. Bang! Arak'Taral turns round and O'Brien beams out. A weapons shot scorches the bulkhead.) [Jungle] (O'Brien uses his tricorder and runs off.) [Laboratory] (Late evening or night.) He's escaped. Using their ship's transporter. They planned this together. He's lying. He's been lying for days. There is no cure here. Even if there was, he wouldn't give it to you. Alive? I knew you once. Trusted you. Obeyed you without question. But now you're like this human, weak, soft, inferior. If being free of white means becoming like you, I don't want to be cured. (Arak'Taral leaves) Spread out. (One kills the tricorder and get thumped by a branch which flies out at him.) [Laboratory] (Bashir is doing an experiment when O'Brien bursts in) You caught him. I shouldn't have doubted you. Should we kill them ourselves or let the others?
