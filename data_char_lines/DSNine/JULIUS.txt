(Siddig El Fasil) Incredible. White Rose Redi Tea. What an appalling concept. I doubt that. No self respecting Englishman would. You're paying him four cents a word? If he's getting four, Kay and I should at least get three. I beg your pardon? The latest Galaxy. Don't do us any favours. I think we can do something with that. Of course you will. You have an affinity for garbage, don't you? How I long for a gun. Very admirable. Ad nauseam, dear. Calm down, dear boy. We're writers, not Vikings. I think you should print your own stories. You know, through a private publishing house. A nice, elegant, little volume. Fifty to a hundred copies. I think it makes it more poignant. What do you think, Benny? It's a smashing title. Wish I'd thought of it. (Benny is let in.) Not yet. Pabst is still at the printers. It's about time. Try to stay calm, Benny.
