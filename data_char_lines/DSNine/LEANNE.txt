Jake! Hi! I came back early. You know, I was just thinking about you. Yeah. I passed by the Klingon restaurant and I was thinking about the time you and I and Orak were eating dinner We stopped seeing each other a few weeks ago. Yeah. So, are you doing anything tomorrow night? Oh. Really? If you do cancel, would you be interested in dinner? Great. How about eighteen hundred at the Klingon restaurant? Definitely. I'll see you then. My father used to take me to the wilderness preserves on Vulcan, so for years I thought their planet was like, animals and plants everywhere. I had no idea there were people on Vulcan. Excuse me? I suppose you want me to sit here and cut your food for you, too? I hope you and your friend enjoy your holosuite. Come on. (Leanne and Riska leave.)
