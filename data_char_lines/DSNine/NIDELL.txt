You'll have to ask Gideon. It's his creation. Commander, can I help you with something? I don't understand. Commander, I don't know what you're talking about. I've never met you before tonight. Commander, obviously you have mistaken me for someone else. Commander. Lieutenant Dax told me. Soon. I just wanted to say goodbye and thank you. It'll be good to get home. For the rest of my life. I've been gone too long as it is. I wish that I could remember Fenna, what she did, how she felt, but I can't. I'm sorry. Tell me one thing. What was she like?
