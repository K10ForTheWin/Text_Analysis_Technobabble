I disagree. Following your suggestion would do nothing to enhance our goals and would result in a significant loss of life. We have all suffered losses at the hands of the Alliance. Nonetheless, logic dictates caution in the face of a superior enemy. And what do you propose we do? You realise it is highly unlikely that anyone assigned to such a mission would survive. We heard your fighter was destroyed. The Alliance said you were dead. Mister Bashir is not convinced that you can persuade your former mate to join our cause.
