Oh, it's not that. Business was good. (Oh look, it's Barbara Bosson) My husband and I ran this place for nine years. Before that, we had a shop on Bajor for seventeen. But a few months ago he passed away, and my heart just not in it anymore. No. It's so much nicer to work next to someone else. You understand. [Racquetball court] (Bashir misses a return) What do you think? Are you proposing to me? (Martus offers her an earring) It's beautiful. And these are wonderful. Where did you find them? I've never seen anything like them. Don't think I didn't see through you right from the start. Well in case you've forgotten, I still hold the lease on this place. I want you out of here by tomorrow, and take those damn things with you.
