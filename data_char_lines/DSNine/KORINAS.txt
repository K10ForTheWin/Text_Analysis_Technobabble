Welcome to Cardassia Prime, Commander. Excuse me. (to soldier) Secure that console while the human is here. Anything else classified level four or above should also be secured. I'm sure you can understand that although we all respect Gul Dukat's decision to bring you here, we must take some precautions. Since you are here to provide technical expertise on the Defiant, I suggest you begin by briefing us on the ship's defensive capabilities. Please, describe for us in detail the weapon systems of the Defiant, beginning with the ship's phaser array and I wondered if you were going to share that little detail with us. The Obsidian Order has known for some time about the loan of a cloaking device from the Romulans to the Federation. Until now, the Order had not considered this one cloak to be a threat against Cardassia. Commander Sisko, you should be commended. I only wish we had someone with such keen tactical instincts who could have prevented this invasion of our territory. [Bridge] No. You'll send no ships to the Orias system. That sector is under direct control of the Obsidian Order and you will not enter it. That matter's classified. Any warship sent into the Orias system will be destroyed. What I am saying is that the Obsidian Order will take whatever steps are necessary to protect the Orias system. And so will I. (A short time later, Dukat returns to the room.) They will never reach Orias. You can count on that. Why are you asking me?
