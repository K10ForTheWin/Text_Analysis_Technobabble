Thank you, Major. [Kira's room] (Kira sits on her bed and hears a thump, then another one. She takes a weapon from her chest of drawers, listens, turns out the lights and opens the door.) [O'Brien's quarters] (Someone moves.) You know these people, Major? Yeah, yeah. I'll be outside if you need me. Major, no! You'll vent the whole corridor! (Kira punches him too, but the baby intervenes and brings her to her knees. Then she passes out.) [Infirmary]
