Get his food card. You got a problem? You look upset. If we've done anything to offend you, please let us know so that we can be sure not to do it again. Really? I never would've guessed. But let me be the first to welcome you. Would you like a piece of this? Gimmies. No sense of fun. In that case, you'd better look somewhere else, new boy. Enjoy your stay. And in a few days I know you're going to feel right at home. Bye [Bridge] Hey, gimmie. I'm talking to you. Let me see your food card. Because I said so. What? Oh, well, when you put it like that. (BC swings at Sisko, Bashir takes on another man. Then a bystander decides to do something.) Get his card. Get his food card. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on, let's go. Everybody put your hands on your head and face the wall. I can do anything I want. Now, against the wall. Well look who we've got here. Way to show initiative, new boy. Take him and throw him back there along with the rest of our guests. I think I am a making a political statement. Maybe if we're lucky, I might even be able to stage a nice little photo op. I hope that meets with your approval. All right! I've waited a long time for this. And I know I won't be disappointed. Ain't that right, new boy?
I've waited a long time for this. And I know I won't be disappointed. Ain't that right, new boy? Hey, what are you looking at? If you're trying to find a way out, forget it Bernardo. You ain't going anywhere. None of you are. I was going to let you think about that for a little bit. Now, everybody, against the wall. Sit down over there. Move! Move it! If any of them moves, shoot'em. Maybe, maybe not. You think I didn't know that? All right, let's use the benches as barricades. We'll stack them up against the windows. It's too bad. I kind of like watching this place burn. (Vin points his gun at BC.) You. You're dead. (Sisko knocks Vin out of the way as the shot is fired, Lee screams, BC aims his weapon at her) Shut up! That's enough! I said shut up! Hey, nice tackle, Bell. You ever play any football? Really, I'd hate to be a catcher and seeing you barreling towards home plate. Hey, you, get up. Oh, nice mouth. All right, you get up. I said get up. Relax. I just want to see what they're saying about us on the Net. I need his access code to log on. Don't make me ask you again. After you. Smart boy. Move. Get back there. This is great. We're on every channel. I bet they're even watching this in China. Why do they sound so surprised? When you treat people like animals, you're gonna get bit. Hey, who said you could come in here? You know this gimmie? Go join your friends. Hey, Bell. You're really missing something over here. [Chris's office] I've got one question for you two. What are all these gimmies doing here? And who invited you? Look, last time I checked this was my party. That means I get to decide who's on the guest list and who isn't. What's that supposed to mean? One. Me. And that's enough. All right, all right, you made your point. Just keep them out of my hair. Don't have to worry about that. I've got it all figured out. And just to prove I'm not such a bad guy, I'm going to let you two in on it. It's simple. We trade the hostages for our freedom. We get amnesty, a handful of credit chips, and a flight to anywhere we want. Personally, I'm thinking Tasmania. Errol Flynn was born in Tasmania. Look, you guys go where you want and I'll go where I want, all right? Well let them get their own hostages. Why don't you have them throw in a couple of silk shirts, maybe a penthouse in Singapore. Jobs? You guys want jobs? When are you going to get it? There are no jobs. Not for us, anyway. All right. All right, we'll do it your way. I'll log onto the Interface and I'll tell them that we want the District closed. What? Is there something wrong with me? I can be as eloquent as the next guy. I knew it! I knew this was a waste of time. They don't care. No one cares about us. What did you say? I really think we should kill this guy. (A woman's voice comes from the terminal.) Get up. Let's go. They want to see a hostage, let's show them a hostage. (It's Lee.) Take a good look, lady. I've got five more just like her. And if we don't get what we want, they're going to get hurt. Have I, Detective? Good. Why would I mind? Go ahead. I have to admit, the thought has crossed my mind. It might alleviate some of the stress I'm feeling. No kidding. Let me ask you something. You think it looks better like this or like this? (BC turns down the brim of his hat.) Give me one reason why not. You really going to shoot me, Bell? I don't think so. I thought we were on the same side here. You gimmies. No sense of fun. Listen up, everybody. A couple of dims just brought us a little present. (Dax is brought in, minus comm. badge) I don't know about you fellas, but I'm in love. You know her? Can you believe it? It's the story of my life. All the good ones are taken. Allow me to introduce myself. Biddle Coleridge. Hey. You crawled in through the sewers? You must really like these guys. It's too bad. I really think me and her could've had something special. [Processing Centre - Lee's cubicle] I've been up on the roof. It looks like another National Guard unit arrived. There's something's going on out there. Hey, kid. (Gives him his hat) Yeah, I thought so. Looks good on you. Now get lost. (Danny leaves.) What the hell. It's probably raining in Tasmania, anyway.
