Done. I did it exactly like you showed me. Should I test it? I doubt that. E-J-Seven? What's wrong? Maybe you left it in Ops. This still seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through to find one tool. Scanners are ready. Level three, section five. Looks like something in a power conduit on level twelve, section eight. Over here, Chief. (There's molten metal on the floor) It must have been melted by the conduit's plasma flow. It doesn't look like the airlock systems have been tampered with. I already have. Everything's normal. Did you know him well? Not really. Bajoran and Starfleet officers don't really socialise that much. I don't know. I guess we just keep to ourselves. You're not like the others. You know. You don't put on any airs. You're just nicer. You sure? Good night. (Neela leaves and O'Brien lets out his breath) Vedek, they found out about the runabout. I have no way to escape. But if I go through with this now, I will be caught and executed. The Prophets spoke. I answered their call. The Prophets spoke! I answered their call! (Odo bundles her away. Kira storms over to Winn as the monks lead Bareil away.)
Aye, sir. Just give me a second. I'll run a diagnostic.
