Relax. Breathe. It won't be long now. (Shakaar enters.) You shouldn't be feeling any pain. Well, it appears you're not going to be having the baby today. You were in labour too long. For whatever reason you weren't able to fully relax. Your system had to stop producing endorphins before they accumulated to toxic levels. It could be a few more days, or a few more weeks. If you want, you can go see Doctor Bashir and have him Nerys, return to your quarters and rest. I'll come by and see you later. (to Shakaar) You. Be punctual next time or don't come at all. (to O'Brien) And you? Practice. [Science lab] (Mora is watching Odo trying to coax baby into shifting, and shaking his head.) The baby has turned. It's time. Awake, child. Shh. Here he comes. That's it, Nerys. Relax. Let it come. That's right. Breathe. (Whaa!)
