Where was she? Come here, sweetie, beside me. Here. They've cut everyone's rations. The Cardassians don't care whether or not we survive. They won't be happy until we're all dead. Come here, sweetie, come here. Have some soup. It's for the children. They're hungry. I can't remember the last time I met a Bajoran who wasn't hungry. I'm Kira Meru. And this is my husband, Taban. My son Reon, my son Pohl, and my daughter Nerys. What is it, honey? What is it? Tell me. (whisper) She wants to know what your name is. But my children! I love you. Don't let them forget me. How? I don't believe this. (A banquet is laid out on the table) Fresh moba. Do you know how long it's been since I've seen fresh moba? (They start eating.) Nice? Look at this. Katterpod beans, hasperat, veklava, a pot of deka tea. We could live on this for a year! Sick from too much food? That would be a change. If only Taban and the children were here. The Cardassians said they would take care of them, so maybe they will. Then what? I suppose that's possible. I failed to show a Cardassian soldier the proper respect. Maybe. But most aren't quite so evident. Why do you keep doing that? Helping me. First at the refugee centre and now here. Well, you have one now. [Wardroom] (The women are dressed up in highly revealing dresses.) What of our families? Are they all right? I It's nothing. The Prophets. I never realised they had such a sense of humour. When I was a child, I dreamed of having enough food to eat and pretty clothes to wear and now look at me. I have everything I ever wanted and I feel horrible. I suppose if I can survive starvation, I could survive this. After all, we Bajorans can survive anything. Luma. I know. I wanted to get a message to you. Who? Hurt me? No, he hasn't hurt me. I wish I knew how to explain to you these past few weeks, make you understand. They're beautiful. (Meru and Dukat hold hands.) Yes. It's true. He's very different from what I expected. It's not that simple. That's not true. He's written to Central Command urging them to rethink their policy toward Bajor. He told me. He tells me everything. You just don't know him. He's promised to help them. He's going to send them food and medical supplies. I have not forgotten him. What do you expect me to do? Kick and bite every time Dukat comes near me? How would that help Taban or the children? A collaborator? Because I share Dukat's bed? Where're you going? I didn't expect to see you again. So would I. Can I get you something? All right. First thing we do is get you some new quarters. Something close by. Okay, Luma. (Meru puts the rod into a monitor.) Why?
