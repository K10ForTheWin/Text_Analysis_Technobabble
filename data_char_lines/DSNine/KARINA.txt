You have one of the Founders of the Dominion on this very station. He should be able to tell us everything we need to know about their intentions. Your own reports indicate that a group of changelings are the real source of power behind the Dominion. We shouldn't have to remind you of the importance both our governments place on continuing to carry out this agreement. It's the first treaty between Romulus and the Federation in many years. That includes any classified reports you may have made to Starfleet Command. Indeed, your emotional state would seem to indicate that our theory is correct and you did abandon the Defiant prematurely when it was attacked by the Jem'Hadar. Why were you in Odo's Quarters when the ship was attacked? About what? You are the only member of the Defiant's crew who was not taken prisoner. Why? Did the Founders believe Odo would react badly if you were harmed? Did they think you held some kind of attraction to him? An interesting theory, Commander. But that's all it is. A theory.
