Let's go. [Ops]
Acknowledged.
Excuse me. That soup. It's ours. Just what? We are all hungry. Like what you're doing now? That's what we were doing. Helping ourselves to some soup. We may have to take orders from the spoonheads, but we don't have to take them from you. (Thug two goes for Kira. She disarms him and throws him at his friend then picks up the knife. They both run off.)
There he is.
I don't know. Full security alert.
Doctor, help us.
That's great.
Infirmary. Aye, sir. [Corridor]
This way. Move quickly. Let's go. Come on. (Winn goes in the opposite direction.) Hurry up.
It's him. First Minister. (The handshakes begin.)
Our sea floor mining project is almost ready to go into operation. The Pan-Caribbean government did have some misgivings, but I think we've won them over. I hear you just came back from Christchurch? Europe is falling apart. You're lucky the police didn't find you first. If they'd caught you on the street without ID, you might have ended up in a Sanctuary District. Why would they? It's the only way to keep those people off the streets.
Stop right there. I'm going to get some sleep.
You two check over there. (They hide in the bracken and Kira passes out from the pain.) [Conduit 3]
Here they are. Welcome.
Yes, sir.
Get him off! (The music changes to burlesque and on come the aggressive looking showgirls.) Come on, step down, ya hack. Oh, honey. Show me, show me!
Stop her! (Kira jumps down onto Dukat, knocking him and the bowl of pills over. He drops his own pill amongst them.)
Yes, ma'am. (Kasidy picks up her bag, then Sisko enters.)
Dabo!
Somebody help us! Get a doctor! (Then suddenly it's all over and they're fine again. Jake and Nog are lead away by a Deputy. Keiko watches thoughtfully.) [Holosuite] (The programme is finished and Iduban is lying on the floor) That's him. I'm not drinking with that scum. Murderer.
Right away. [Bunker]
Report to the staging area.
under heavy fire from Tzenkethi warships. I don't know how much longer we can hold out. Can anyone hear me, This is
What's she doing? (Yassim is standing on the upper level, on the wrong side of the rail, a rope around her neck tied to the railing.)
Quark, this isn't what I wanted. (storms out.)
Trevean. Trevean, help me. (More people call for the quick and easy way out of their pain, and Trevean obliges them. The dawn rises on a ward full of shrouds.)
Down in the front!
