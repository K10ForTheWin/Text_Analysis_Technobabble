Your father and I used to sing that song when you were just a small boy. Did I ever tell you how your father saved my family's honour during our bloodfeud with the House of Duras? It is a good story! Your father was a great warrior. My family owes him everything we have. I wish there was some way I could repay him. The real reason? I suppose you have the right to know. You are a Klingon warrior and it would be wrong to keep you away from battle. And it's going to be a glorious battle! [Promenade - upper level]
