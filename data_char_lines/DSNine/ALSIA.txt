When my husband was alive, we ran the business together, and I managed to put away a bit of latinum every year just for myself. Now he's gone, well, I've got quite a little sum. Well, to be honest, it's not enough. Not for the future. Not for the way I want to live out my retirement. So, I've decided to invest it all. I can't believe I'm telling you this. I just met you but I feel like I can really trust you. It's like I've known you forever. I'm taking everything I've saved and I'm purchasing the mining concession on the entire Vlugta asteroid belt. (Odo is coming up the stairs) Not this time. My father was a stellar cartographer. Thirty years ago, he conducted a full spectrum mineral analysis of those asteroids but he never had the means to follow up on what he found. When his survey results become public, I'll get seven times my investment back overnight. I still can't believe I'm telling you this. My secret plan. I've been thinking about it for years. I never even told my husband. It must be all this Gamzian wine. It hasn't been easy. There's so much to keep track of, so much to do. It's true. We were just talking. Martus, I just received word that the Vlugta government has accepted my bid. They won't finalise the transaction until I commission a study on the effects of asteroid mining on inner-system navigation. All my money is committed to the bid. I can't afford the study and I only have a week to get it done. Ten thousand Isiks. I hope I can find an investor in time. Once I begin mining, I'd pay back ten times ten thousand. Oh, Martus, I don't know how to thank you. (Alsia kisses him and leaves) (Rom is checking canap√©s with a tricorder) Oh, Martus, you don't know how much this means to me. You won't regret this. You'll see. We'll both be rich. (She leaves with the box of money. He plays a machine and loses.) [O'Brien's quarters] (Miles is psyching himself up in a mirror)
