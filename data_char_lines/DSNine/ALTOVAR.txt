I'm willing to pay whatever's necessary. Name your price. That's my business. You're not going anywhere, Doctor. (Bashir shoots him with his phaser. No effect.) You're staying right here, trapped on this station, watching while I destroy you piece by piece. And when all the best parts of you are gone, when there's nothing left but the withered shell, then, and only then, will I put you out of your misery. (Bashir runs) You can't escape, Doctor. You can run if you want to, but you can't outrun death. (Wrinkly Bashir finds Kira's body) Everyone loses. [Promenade] (Bashir falls. There's a hand on his shoulder.) You've put up an entertaining struggle, Doctor. Now it's time to make things easy on yourself. Why not? Isn't that what you've always done? Remember, Doctor, I'm inside your head. I know all about you. When you were younger, you wanted to be a tennis player, didn't you. Don't lie to me. Not in here. You were good enough. But you knew your parents wouldn't approve of it. So you gave up and you became a doctor instead. But you loved tennis more. And what about medical school? You should've been first in your class. What went wrong? You mistook a pre-ganglionic fibre for a post-ganglionic nerve. But pre-ganglionic fibres and post-ganglionic nerves aren't anything alike. Any first year medical student could tell them apart. You purposely answered the question wrong. You didn't want to be first in your class. You couldn't take the pressure. Isn't it? Then let's talk about Lieutenant Dax. You like her, don't you? But she could've been a lot more if you'd tried a little harder. But you'd rather give up than fight, wouldn't you? Wait. Where are you going? [Infirmary] What do you think you're doing? Get away from that panel. Take a close look, Doctor. You're dying. Why can't you just accept it? You can't do this.
