Well, you should tell your friend to live a little. Life's too short to deprive yourself of the simple pleasures. I should know. No, but my life was too short. Still, I'm lucky. I continue to exist as part of you. Just as Jadzia will go on existing when the symbiont is passed on to a new host. We're part of something bigger than any one of us. I just feel lucky to have been chosen. Come in.
