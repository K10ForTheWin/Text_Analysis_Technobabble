So you're not afraid of Mister Worf? (Worf gets his blade against her neck.) Why did you select Worf for this mission? Mister Quark, is this necessary? Was there anything unusual about that? And that's unusual? [Wardroom] You're chasing the bird of prey, it cloaks. You anticipate your opponent's manoeuvre, so you give the order. The crew obeys. The ship comes about, and then your helm officer tells you. Now stop right there. [Wardroom] Do you give the order to fire? I'm not interested in whether you think it's a fair question or not. You're in command. There's a ship out there decloaking. You don't know what it is. [Wardroom]
