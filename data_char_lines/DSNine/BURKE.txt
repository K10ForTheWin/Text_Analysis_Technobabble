Medkit. Over there. Now. (Jake grabs the kit.) Hypo. Sit me up. Do it. I'm not going to die with my face in the dirt. Okay. (Burke gives himself a shot.) How's your head? You're lucky I didn't kill you. I thought you were a Klingon. Have you seen any? Klingons. Are there any patrols around? What about Starfleet? It's just you and me then. What are you doing out here? Why'd you leave the settlement? Lucky me. I could use the company. Here. Water. Go ahead. Probably would've leaked out of me anyway. Don't let me fall over. I want to go out looking up at the sky, not at the ground. You didn't see a crashed hopper around here, did you? They made it! My platoon. The Klingons had us pinned down. We couldn't beam out because they had a transport scrambler running. We called for a hopper. As soon as it set down, the Klingons came after us. CO ordered me and Brice to lay down cover so the squad could get up the ramp. By the time Brice got in, the Klingons were practically on top of us. The hopper was taking such a pounding, I didn't think it would make it off the ground. The hypo, where is it? Figures. With what? Kid, you try carrying me, my guts are going to spill all over your shoes. Forget it. Ran? The doctor. You left him. That's what you call it. And now you think bringing me back is going to make everything all right. Sorry, kid. Life doesn't work like that. (Burke dies coughing up blood, and Jake flees the crater.) [Engine room]
