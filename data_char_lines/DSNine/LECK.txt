I hope this is a secure channel. Very good. Who do you want eliminated? Then why call an eliminator? I work alone. I don't care about latinum. I enjoy a challenge. The Dominion? How can we be sure these schematics are accurate? No need to stand on formality here. Just call me Leck. Don't be ridiculous. We don't have a ship? Where? No one likes Liquidators. Did you say ship? I saw we weren't going to rescue her so I put her out of her misery. This isn't a ship, it's a closet. Because he doesn't trust the Dominion. And neither do I. Well, you have nothing to worry about. You'll have plenty of places to run and hide. (Quark enters with a manacled Vorta, the one who had his Jem'Hadar killed by Sisko and co.) Great, another closet. What you need is a new backbone. You don't seem to be too happy at the prospect of being rejoining your people. You heard him, move. Perhaps you can help me clarify something. What's the most vulnerable part of a Jem'Hadar's body? It's Gaila! (They open the storeroom door.) Oh, to stand once more in those rivers of muck. He said fifty. I don't. I just don't to be cheated. He's lying. They're in it together. You idiot. (Later, the corpse is on a bed with those forehead things blinking) Quark's right. Let's do it for Ishka. Let's do it for the Grand Nagus. Let's do it for Ferengis everywhere. This is the sloppiest, most amateurish operation I've ever seen. If you ever do something like this again, count me in.
Once again, Nagus, you have proven that you have the wisest lobes in all of Ferenginar.
