have entered restricted space you must turn around and leave immediately. That's impossible, Major we have strict orders not to allow any Skrreean vessel to land. I'm sorry, Major, but we have our orders. They come directly from General Hazar. Skrreean ship. Repeating. Return to the space station now. They've opened fire on us. Taking evasive action. We've been hit! The Skrreean ship exploded. I didn't even think we hit it.
We are within disruptor range. Sensors show multiple lifeforms on the surface. They appear to be in a liquid state. All ships report ready. All weapons charged. The first barrage is complete. Thirty percent of the planetary crust destroyed on opening volley. No change in lifeform readings. Our sensor readings have been confirmed by three other warbirds. There has been no change in the number of life-signs on the surface. Colonel, there are ships coming out of the nebula. Jem'Hadar fighters. One hundred fifty. Cardassian cruiser Koranak has been destroyed. Romulan warbirds Makar and Belak have lost main power. Main power's out. Switching to emergency backups. Four more Jem'Hadar vessels are closing on our position. (BOOM and fire breaks out. Garak leaves.) [Warbird Odo's quarters] (Garak knocks out the guard, takes his weapon and enters.)
