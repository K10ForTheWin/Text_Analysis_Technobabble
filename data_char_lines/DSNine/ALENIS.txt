Major My name is Alenis Grem. I'm doing a study on the Elemspur Detention Centre for the Bajoran Central Archives and I was hoping to ask you a few questions. Cardassian records clearly indicate that a Kira Nerys was held at Elemspur for seven days. I don't understand. I have the records right here. Kira Nerys of Dahkur Province, a member of the Shaakar resistance cell. You see? (An id photo pops up in the corner of the screen.) I know. That's why I called. The Major contacted me before she left. She was supposed to meet with me so I could show her the information I retrieved from Elemspur. She never came. I tried to contact the Major to reschedule, but she wasn't where she said she'd be. As far as I can tell, no one's seen her since she left the spaceport for Elemspur.
