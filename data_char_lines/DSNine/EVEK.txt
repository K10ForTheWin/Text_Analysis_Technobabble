(Cardassian Gul) The Federation merchant ship refused to be boarded! It was clear the Federation ship was carrying weapons through the Demilitarised zone. (Sisko and Dukat enter) Dukat. No one informed us you were coming. I see. I'm glad you're here to listen to this, Commander. A strange voice from a Federation runabout. Well, obviously they had their hands full. Unprovoked, was it? Do you deny that the Federation is engaging in organised terrorist activities against the Cardassian people? Deliberately attempting to undermine this treaty? Then perhaps then you can explain where the Federation ship came from, the one outfitted with photon torpedoes? They have a right to defend themselves against organised terrorist activities. On the contrary, we have the confession of the Federation terrorist responsible for the destruction of the Bok'Nor at your station, Commander. A forty three year old male human, William Patrick Samuels, born Bergan, Norway, Earth. Came to the Federation colony on Volan Two twenty years ago. Married, wife's name Louise, two female children aged fourteen and twelve. He was quite cooperative once we apprehended him on Deep Space Nine. (Hudson puts the data rod into a desk monitor) On the contrary, he confessed quite early in the interrogation procedure, far sooner than we expected. I believe he truly felt remorse. Bring him in. (A body is carried in on a stretcher) Unfortunately, he committed suicide in his cell. (Amaros leaps over the table and tries to throttle Evek. Hudson pulls him off)
