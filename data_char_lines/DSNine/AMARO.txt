(Male security) Don't worry, you play with your wrenches, we'll watch your back. [Runabout] (Nog follows the group in carrying a rifle.) Can I help you, Cadet? We should find them, say hello. (tricorder) This thing's not working. Well, we could always try sending smoke signals. Don't worry. I'll watch your back. You're going to have more than a headache if you don't do what the Chief wants. Is there a point to this story? I hope not. I want to get him myself. Stolzoff was my friend. We were at the Academy together. (Garak spots the second soldier and slides into the shadows) She was my sparring partner. The first time we faced off I remember thinking I ought to take it easy on her. She ended up taking me down so hard it knocked the wind out of me. That was the last time I ever pulled a punch with her. She had this one two combination, a feint to the right and a chop to the neck, faked me out every time. If that spoonhead gives me the chance, I'll just try it out on him. I think Stolzoff would have liked that. What does it look like? He asked me to get a coil spanner for him. I just turned my back for a second. He's out there. Garak. He stabbed me. (Amaro dies.)
