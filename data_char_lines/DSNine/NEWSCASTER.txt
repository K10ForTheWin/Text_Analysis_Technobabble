National Guard units are mobilising now and should reach Sanctuary District A within the hour. Governor Chen has issued a statement saying the uprising will be quelled and District secured. It's still not clear how this riot began, though rumours of mounting tensions have been filtering out of the district for weeks. Many of the district employees fleeing the riot have been reported injured and several have yet to be accounted for. There's been no official count of injuries among Sanctuary residents, however satellite pictures show a number of possible casualties. We'll have more on this story as information becomes available.
