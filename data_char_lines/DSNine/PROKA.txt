We didn't come here to cause trouble. Has this Garak filed a complaint? I wish they'd shown as much concern when they left my boy and dozens like him to fend for themselves. My wife and I felt that Rugal shouldn't suffer for crimes committed by others. That Cardassian should have minded his own business. To hate Cardassians? It shouldn't be too hard, should it? We told him the truth, Commander. The truth about what Cardassia did to Bajor. He needed to know, and for that I make no apologies. To us, he isn't even one of them anymore. He isn't Cardassian, he's Bajoran. And we love him just as if he were our own flesh and blood. [Quark's] It is not true. It is not true. Rugal will tell you. We have not mistreated him. Is this some Cardassian? What if I refuse? Go on, Rugal. We'll talk tomorrow. They won't hurt you. They're humans, not Cardassians. [Infirmary] You gave up custody when you abandoned him here. There is no more Cardassian law on Bajor It must be someone who is neither a Cardassian nor a Bajoran. What about you?
