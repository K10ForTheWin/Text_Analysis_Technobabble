Elemspur? I haven't thought about that place for a long time. I'll try and. Now wait a minute. I remember you. You were there, too, weren't you? Kiri something? I almost didn't recognise you. You used to wear your hair differently, didn't you? Longer? When the Cardassians dragged you out of our cell, I gave you up for dead. Glad to see I was wrong. Those were bad times.
