(the injured boy) Oo-mata! Oo-mata! Dongo patar meeoto fenta. Fenta! Vala. Vala! Ask him! That's because you sprayed that vapour on us! This isn't over yet, Big Ears! [Security office] (Nog is looking at the most wanted posters) Nowhere. To wash. That was very funny, what you did. Nobody's laughing. He doesn't sound sorry to me. (Tumak punches Nog and the fight starts. Jake pulls Tumak to the ground while the other two flatten Nog, who screams. Quark hears it from his upper level cafe and comes over) I thought we were welcome here. You don't want us here. You don't want anything to do with us. We don't want anything to do with you. Any of you! Is that big-eared troll really your friend? He's an idiot. I don't plan on being around here that long. Does he? Do you want to move there? Neither do I. [Guest quarters] (Haneek is pensive when the doorbell rings)
