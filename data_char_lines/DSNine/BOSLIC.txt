A pleasant one, I hope. I have some salvage for you, Quark. Oh, it's perfectly legal and it's really salvage this time. I think you'll like this junk, Quark. It's wreckage from a ship that crashed in the Gamma Quadrant. Three bars of latinum and you can have it all. I don't know. There's no time. Quark, you and I have been doing business for years. Don't you trust me? [Cargo bay] (The bay is stuffed full of strange large pieces of metal.)
