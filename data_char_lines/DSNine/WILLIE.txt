Hey, Benny. (A black New York Giants baseball player walks past.) (Michael Dorn) Catch the game? (He goes into a room.) Cassie, hear the game last night? Went two for four, robbed Snider of a tater. Should have heard the crowd yelling and carrying on. Would you please tell this fool to take his business someplace else? Suit yourself. But if you ask me, it's a waste of a very pretty heart. That's all right, I'll get another turn at bat. How about some steak and eggs? The hell I can. They can hardly get used to the idea of me playing alongside them. Living next to them? That's a whole other story. Besides, around here, when people look at me, it's 'cause they admire me. There, I'm just another coloured boy who can hit a curve ball. Now, if you will excuse me, my public awaits. (Willie goes to a table of four girls, and young lads come over for autographs.) Ladies. Oh, hi guys. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. You don't look so good. You sick or something? What are you doing till ten? Bottom of seventh, I'm up again. Oh two fastball, ham, into the left field bleachers. Had to be four hundred feet. Oh, but you got to admit, they don't tell like I tell it. Hey, man, did you hear the game last night? I went two for four.
