Commander, the Cardassian Central Command has gone on military alert in response to the kidnapping of Gul Dukat. This Security Chief of yours, the shape-shifter. Odo. Are you sure you wouldn't be better off with a Starfleet officer heading your security team. If you say so, Commander. Good. Keep me informed of your progress. And what is that? The Maquis are a bunch of irresponsible hotheads. I'm aware of that, Commander. We never should've allowed those colonists to remain on the Cardassian side of the Demilitarised zone. What about Commander Hudson? He's lived with these people. What's his analysis of the situation? You do that. And Commander, I want you to find the Maquis. Talk to them. Remind them that they're citizens of the Federation. That it is imperative that we preserve the treaty with the Cardassians. Are you questioning Federation policy, Commander? Personally, I think you're overstating the problem. Establish a dialogue with the Maquis. They're still Federation citizens. I'm sure they'll listen to reason. Good luck, Commander.
