I think so. (The tall, thin alien pushes Tauvid back into the room.) Where is it? Yes, you do. (to Sorm) Well? That's not good. Is it possible we have the wrong man? This is very embarrassing. Now listen to me. We know why you're here, we know who you came to meet, and we know what you were going to give her. So for the last time, where is it? You see? It was him all along. (Tauvid pulls his weapon but Sorm vapourises him) Look what you did to the carpet. (Scorch marks where Tauvid was kneeling when he died.) We wait for the woman. She might know where he hid it [Quark's - upper level] It's called hasperat. She's with that changeling security chief. They have the crystal. We've got to make sure she doesn't access it. You'll get over it. [Guest quarters] I talked to Draim. The woman asked to make a deal. She gives us the crystal, Draim lets her go. Don't be stupid. As soon as we've got the crystal, she dies. Just me. (Liar, liar, pants on fire.) [Corridor] Do you have it? I thought we had a deal. Your life for the crystal. Your turn. Indulge me. (So she goes through the same moves.) Very smart. (Arissa hands over the crystal.) Do you have any idea what's on this? Oh, don't go yet. You haven't met my associate. (Sorm steps out.) He was in a very emotional state when he agreed to it. The truth is, you really hurt his feelings when you left. You were supposed to secure the doors!
