(a female Dosi) This is a waste of time. We should be talking directly to Zek. Then why do you bother talking to this insignificance? Then bring us Zek. Are you implying that Zek is too important to negotiate with us? I control the interests so I want to supervise all operation. Then find another partner. Are you enjoying yourselves, little Ferengi? This? This is where opportunities are made. Then you thought wrong. This is all about profit. And like the Ferengi, the Dosi are very serious when it comes to profit. (Someone gets shot) Very serious. I'm not interrupting anything, am I? Are you sure? I'll come back tomorrow. But you seem to be busy. All right, then. Let me give you some advice. Inglatu will never sell you a hundred thousand vats of tulaberry wine. Not because he doesn't want to, but because he can't. I wish I could, but there aren't that many vats on the entire planet. Not necessarily. If you really want a hundred thousand vats of tulaberry wine, I can put you in touch with the right people. For a price, of course. The Karemma. An important power in the Dominion. Let's just say if you want to do business in the Gamma Quadrant, you have to do business with the Dominion. [Zek's ship]
