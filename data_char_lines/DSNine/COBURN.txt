(human male Admiral) There's one thing that still concerns me. Earth. You've left it a very tempting target. But what if you're wrong, and the Dominion doesn't commit its forces to protect Deep Space Nine? What if instead they launch a full-scale assault on Earth? If we follow the plan you're proposing, we'll never be able to get reinforcements there in time.
