I cannot tell you how grateful I am, Captain. The Klingons were going to execute me tomorrow. Of course, they say that every day. It's one of the little games they like to play. Oh, yes. I have to promise to stay away from the Klingon Empire. That'll be tough. And I have to create some kind of a special holoprogramme for you. I can hardy wait. I've never worked for Starfleet before. Oh. A personal matter. Something special for your eyes only. Something with, perhaps, five or six Orion slave girls and Garak is here? Oh. Oh. Well, that's different. I'll wait in my quarters. So, you are happy? Done. Who gets it? Well. It has been a pleasure doing business with you, gentlemen. Call me again if you ever need What? What do you mean? That isn't fair. You can't keep me here against my will! I haven't done anything wrong. We had an agreement. (Sisko pushes Tolar up against the bulkhead.) All right. It will pass. You'll see. It will pass.
