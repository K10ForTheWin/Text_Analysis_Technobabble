(a man) Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to bother you but tomorrow, after evening services in the Temple we're having my daughter's ih'tanu ceremony. She's turning fourteen. We were wondering if there's any chance you could come and give her your blessing. It would mean so much to us. Thank you, Emissary.
