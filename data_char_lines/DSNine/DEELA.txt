Yes. Yes, the Bajorans opened their hearts to many abandoned children. I don't recognise either of the names. What was it you were trying to find out about them? The Cardassians were still here. You'll never find anything from back then. I wouldn't know. I wasn't a volunteer then. I was in the underground. Our computers don't work. I can't get a technician to come out. We're not exactly a top priority.
