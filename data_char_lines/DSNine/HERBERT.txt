(Armin Shimmerman) Pabst! Pabst! Get out here. I'll give you one guess. They're stale again. Delicious, my eye. These are two days old and you know it. That's it, I quit. I'm going over to Galaxy. I bet that rag knows the difference between a doughnut and a doorstop. (Benny and Albert enter quietly) For that fantasy crap you write, you're lucky to be getting two. Let me see that. Heinlein, Bradbury, Sturgeon. Quite a lineup. Add Herbert Rossoff to them and it'd be complete. Why should I believe you? Okay, I'll stay. Oh, I bet you can. I can see it now, the lonely little girl befriended by empathetic aliens who teach her how to smile. It's enough to make you go out and buy a television set. Next. Be that as it may, that is the worst piece of garbage I have ever seen. I'll take it. The picture may be garbage, but the story? The story will be art. (A picture of Deep Space Nine) Oh yes, if the world's not ready for a woman writer, imagine what would happen if it learned about a Negro with a typewriter. Run for the hills! It's the end of civilisation. Would someone please shoot me and put me out of my misery? You're a dog. Bless you, my child. It's a damn fine piece of writing is what it is. And Deep Space Nine is a very intriguing title. The master of understatement. What he really means is he wishes he had half your talent. Douglas, you're not going to stand there and tell us you don't like this story. And men from Mars are? Congratulations, Douglas. That's the most imbecilic attempt to rationalise personal cowardice that I've ever heard. What's that supposed to mean? You calling me a red? I'm not going to stand here and let some craven fascist call me a pinko and get away with it. That's because he is a robot. No offence, Albert. Hold on. Making it a dream guts the story. What about the other Sisko stories? You can't make them all dreams. Hey, Benny. Long time no see. Douglas? Magazine? What!
