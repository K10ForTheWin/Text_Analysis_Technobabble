Gentlemen. I am Faren Kag, the village magistrate. This village is in great jeopardy. I only hope you're not too late. [Sirah's chamber] (A very old man lies in bed) Has he shown any sign of improvement? You must help him. Others? It is. If he dies, we all die. [Quark's back room] The Sirah, how is he? Is there anything you can do? But we need him. The Dal'Rok will be here soon. It's a terrible creature that lives in the woods just north of the village. Every year at the end of harvest it appears. Yes, it always comes for five nights. This will be the fourth. And only the Sirah is strong enough to defeat it. If what you say is true, this village will be destroyed tonight. [Corridor] The Sirah has left us, but the Prophets have sent us his successor. A new Sirah to tell the story. A new Sirah to protect the village. [Quark's] These gifts are for you, Sirah. Is there a problem, Sirah? Of course. (The women leave) You must send for them. So they can live here with you. Then who will tell the story? But there is no one else. The Sirah chose you. But what about the Dal'Rok? Without your protection, he will kill us all. You must tell the story. May the Prophets grant you victory, Sirah. What is this? You have no right to wear those clothes. You had your chance to prove yourself. You failed. That's right, because you won't be allowed to endanger the village a second time. Now take off those robes. Sirah, it's time you were getting ready. The people will be assembling soon to hear the story. [Commander's office] The Sirah! The Sirah!
