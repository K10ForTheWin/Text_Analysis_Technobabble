Ma. Ma. Ma. Ma. Ho muh. Home. Home. Home. Molly. Molly home. Daddy home Molly. Mommy home Molly. Starry stars. Home? Home! (She picks up the picture of the picnic.) Home. Home. Molly home. Mummy, Mummy, Daddy. (Then runs back and turns a cartwheel.) (distraught) Home! Daddy, home. Home. (Bashir hypos her.) Lupi. Home? Stars. Your home. Molly loves you. (Keiko cries and Molly steps through into the past, where the portal is still lying at an angle. She hears whimpering. There's a grubby little girl nearby who is wearing her bracelet.) Molly? There. (Meanwhile, in their future, O'Brien powers up a phaser. Molly 2 is leading little Molly to the portal.) Mommy, Daddy there. (Molly 2 hands Lupi over and Molly steps into the vortex.) Molly home. (And she ceases to exist, because just as O'Brien raises the phaser, little Molly steps out and runs to her parents.)
