I'm Doctor Hanor Pren of the Trill science ministry. Allow me to introduce you our team leader, Doctor Lenara Kahn, and her brother, Doctor Bejal Otner. Major Kira, Commander Worf, Commander Dax. Two minutes, maybe less. Once the wormhole forms, we can shut down the tensor matrix. We'll also need to download our parameters for the matrix into one of your computers. All right. [Bridge] Well, that explains the seven percent falloff in AFR ratios I keep seeing. Must be a problem with diagnostic sub-routines. I have a recalibration unit in my quarters that might solve the problem. Oh, no, no. I need a break anyway. (Pren leaves. Dax and Lenara are alone together.) They're very friendly today. They had dinner last night. Alone. I shouldn't have to say anything. I'm picking up a subspace distortion. Probe's ready for launch. Activate the drone. (A wormhole opens)
