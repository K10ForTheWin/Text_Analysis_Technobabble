He wasn't very friendly when we located him. (The handcuffs are removed.) Just the one on the jaw. The rest he got thanks to the Orion Syndicate. No. There's no evidence of that. It could have been an accident. We pull a dozen bodies a month out of that river. You think they're all Syndicate murders? If we hadn't interfered, you'd be dead. When your mother called us, we already had word that a Starfleet Intelligence operative was trying to infiltrate the Syndicate. It didn't take long to realise that it was your friend. We found him being beaten up by a pair of Nausicaans. The Syndicate would never kill the widow of an operative. The only thing holding them together is this loyalty they show to operatives and their families. Mrs Tigan, please contact us if there's anything else we can do for you.
