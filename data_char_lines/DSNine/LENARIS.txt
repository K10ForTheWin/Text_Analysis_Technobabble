Hold. (Kira and Shakaar walk down the slope.) Set a perimeter and watch the hills. Nobody fires until I give the order. That's far enough. Shakaar? We've met. I've wanted to thank you for a long time. I had a brother at Gallitep when you liberated the camp. Well. I take it from your calm demeanour that I've walked into an ambush. I should have stayed up on the ridge line, never come down into the valley. I think I should tell you I've been in worse situations. You know about that? If you know about Pullock Five, then you should also know I won't give up without a fight. If you're here to ask me to surrender, you're wasting your time. Cease fire! Cease fire! Lieutenant. Take this man's weapon and get him off the perimeter. Now, I believe you were saying something about wanting to walk out of here? You know that's impossible. Neither did I. So, what do we do about it? [Winn's office] They're not my prisoners. I've consulted with the other army commands, and he has their full support.
