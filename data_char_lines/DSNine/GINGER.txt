(Blonde) Surprise! Look, it's the piano player. We saw you perform tonight. Melissa thinks you're adorable. You know, I once played on the same bill with Liberace. He has the sweetest dimples. We're going to see Shecky? He plays the piano and he's funny. Kind of like Victor Borge.
There you are. Vic, sweetie, are you ready? Jimmy and Peter are about to go on.
