Aye, sir.
Sir, up here. One of the Ferengi's holosuites is in use. [Holosuite] (Sisko, Li and O'Brien in uniform around a table.)
There is a perimeter alert in the Almatha sector. Gul Toran of the Sixth Order, and he's identified the vessel. It's the Defiant. The Defiant is attacking outpost sixty one. Sir, another perimeter alert. Outpost forty seven has detected a cloaked ship with their anti-proton beam. The Defiant has decloaked and begun to attack the outpost. We've lost contact with outpost forty seven. Incoming message from Gul Toran. The Defiant has recloaked and it's last know heading was one four eight, mark two one five. There's an incoming message from the warship Kraxon. They say they've found an unusual neutrino signature in their sector. It looks like radiation from a damaged warp plasma relay. No. But they're scanning the area with their anti-proton beams. The Kraxon reports that the neutrino signature has just phase-shifted, and is moving now at warp speed directly toward the Orias system. Three more ships have just appeared in the Orias system. Cardassian warships. Keldon Class.
You. Come with us. (They grab Dax.) Nothing. Yet. Latinum? Where is it? Tempting offer. Maybe next time. This one's been selected. Don't move. (Sisko, Odo and Garak are arrested violently.) [Terok Nor - Holding cell] (The cells are crowded and noisy) We just got the word. Your execution's been scheduled for nineteen hundred. That's two hours from now.
