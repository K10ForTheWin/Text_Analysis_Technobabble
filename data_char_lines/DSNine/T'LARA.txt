This hearing will come to order. We are here to consider the request of the Klingon Empire that Lieutenant Commander Worf be extradited for trial on charges of murder. Advocate Ch'Pok, you may present your charges. I will hear formal evidence beginning tomorrow afternoon at fifteen hundred hours. [Promenade] The question of Commander Worf's motive is relevant. I will allow you to explore this issue, but only as far as logic permits. You may call your first witness. (The first witness is Dax.) The captain is correct. Without a properly executed search order, or the permission of the defendant, any information you have accessed from his private database may not be admitted into evidence. Yes or no, Commander? Restrain yourself, Advocate. Captain, since you are also acting as defence counsel, if you wish to add anything to the record, you are free to do so. Call your next witness. [Quark's] Any objection? Advocate. Advocate, you are stepping well beyond the bounds of protocol. This will stop or I will hold both of you in contempt. Captain Sisko? Very well. I will not compel you to testify, Advocate.
