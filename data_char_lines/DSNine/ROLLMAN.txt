Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Major. I'll stay in close touch with the situation. Ben, that Bajoran woman you have working for you interrupted a staff meeting to tell me how she disapproves of your handling of this asylum matter. I think you have a problem there, Commander.
I know who you are. Listen to me very carefully. Return to DS Nine immediately. Turn the ship around and go back. You will not be harmed. (O'Brien cuts transmission)
