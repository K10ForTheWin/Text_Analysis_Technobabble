This will be an informal hearing, so I'm going to start with some informal advice. I am one hundred years old. I do not have time to squander listening to superfluous language. In short, I intend being here until supper, not senility. Understood? You seek the extradition. Make your case. Thank you, I've already read the warrant and charges. The crimes described are thirty years old. What took you so long? Fine. Sit. Commander, the warrant is in order. On what grounds do you ask that I deny extradition? It would have been easier on me, Commander, had you not raised that particular point. But the penalty for these crimes on your planet is death, and that is rather permanent. So before I grant extradition, you will convince me please, that the person named in your warrant is the person who is standing here now. [Commander's office] Excuse me. It also seems rather convenient to have you with us. How do you come here? And do you know the accused personally? We accept you as an expert on Trills. Proceed. Mister Tandro, you have made your point. Gentlemen, I said this would be an informal hearing, not riotous. We will take a two hour recess. (Later) The answer seems simple enough to me. Split her down the middle. Send the symbiont back to stand trial and keep the host here. Oh, what a surprise. Please enlighten me. I see. Proceed, Commander. Any more witnesses, Commander Sisko? You know where the witness stand is. Following a one hour recess, Lieutenant Dax will take the witness chair. One hour. (Renora leaves) Lieutenant Dax, you're either two hundred years older than I am or you're about the same age as my great granddaughter. At first I wondered which of those you were. Now I am bothered by the likelihood that you may be both. Let's finish this, Commander. And you are? Mister Tandro, you will want to re-examine your extradition request. Until then this hearing is adjourned. [Promenade - upper level]
