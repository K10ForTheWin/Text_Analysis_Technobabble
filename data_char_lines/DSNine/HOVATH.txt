None. I'm here. It's still two hours before nightfall. Sirah. There are more gifts outside for you. I was his apprentice. Why ask me? Surely the Sirah must have taught you all you need to know. You are not the true Sirah. I am. (pause for gasp and adverts) For nine years, I studied with the Sirah, learning the secrets of the storyteller, only to have you come along and take my place. It was his way of punishing me. Three nights ago, the Sirah allowed me to tell the story. But when the Dal'Rok appeared I was unable to control it. Several people were injured. With this. The stone is said to be a fragment of an orb from the Celestial Temple. Many years ago, this village was deeply divided by hate and mistrust. The first Sirah knew that unless he could find a way to unite the people, the village would destroy itself. So he used the Orb fragment as a catalyst to give their fears a physical form. Yes, but they don't know that. It's a secret which has passed from Sirah to Sirah. The story helps focus the villagers' thoughts. I know if I had another chance, I could control the Dal'Rok. I have every right. It won't happen again. I do. No, Faren is right. These people will never accept me as Sirah. Without their support I could never control the Dal'Rok. You have to. Something's wrong. Wait, there is no need to run. A new voice appears to challenge the Dal'Rok. The Dal'Rok is a fearsome enemy. The mountains tremble with its fury. But our prosperity is its misery. Our unity is its vulnerability. And our strength is its doom. (Out come the lights against the cloud.) Look, the Dal'Rok trembles. It fears our strength. It fears our determination. It knows it cannot stand against us because the village is united. We are as one. (The cloud shrinks to nothing and the wind stops.) You see for yourselves the Dal'Rok is defeated. This village is safe for another year.
