This is Internment camp three seven one. You are here because you are enemies of the Dominion. No talking. It's time. I've been looking forward to this. Today, we train against a worthy adversary. Observe, analyse, remember. Soon we will face his people in combat. The lessons you learn here will ensure victory. Victory is life. Begin. (Worf is the first to hit the floor, but he soon gets his own back.) [Barracks] He was our youngest and least experienced. I promise your next opponent will provide more of a challenge. [Promenade - upper level] Until tomorrow. I never do. And that is something you will never understand. Prepare yourself. I've found you a worthy opponent. Right in front of you. Victory is life. Enough, Klingon. You have proven your worth. It's over. I yield. I yield. I cannot defeat this Klingon. All I can do is kill him, and that no longer holds my interest.
Cardassians are all alike. You talk too much. I give the orders here. Release me or die. This is Internment camp three seven one. You are here because you are enemies of the Dominion. There is no release, no escape, except death. [Ops] Very well. You will be sheltered in barracks six. You are free to move about the compound. But remember, beyond the atmospheric dome there is nothing but airless vacuum and barren rock. Leave the dome, even for an instant, and you die. I've been waiting for another Klingon. (In the central of the association area is a fight ring. Jem'Hadar versus a Klingon.) Enough. It's over. But for you, it's just beginning. (The Jem'Hadar leave the prisoners.)
