Last night alone we had dozens of beatings. They're everywhere, then we go looking for them and they're nowhere. Probably. We've got to put a stop to this before it gets out of hand. The provisional government is bringing troops into the capital, (Quark enters) That will put an end to the Circle. You keep your eyes open up there, old friend.
Can I help you?
You two. What are you doing? I've not been informed of any computer problems. I do not know you. What is your name? How long have you been aboard, Commander? My words were ill-chosen, Commander. Perhaps I can help in your investigation.
(female) Completely disabled, General. Organic? Yes, sir. The primary sensor array was sabotaged, sir. As soon as we tested it, the subnet shorted out. General, the security net is back online. Not picking up a thing, sir. General, the enemy has attacked our position at airlock fourteen. Surveillance cameras have been sabotaged. Four, sir.
Preliminary tachyon scans are negative. Shields up. Going to Red alert. [Runabout Mekong] Enemy ships within range. Ready to fire at your command. I'm getting casualty reports from decks four, five, eight and seventeen. We also have a plasma leak in our port nacelle. Aye, sir. Damage control team to level seven. Our tactical control systems are down. We've lost all power to phasers.
Computer, lights. This was Ibudan's quarters. Feel free to look around. That's what he requested, but only one passenger was logged in. He probably just wanted larger quarters. If there's anything else you need. Of course. I'll get you a copy of the ship's manifest. (The officer leaves)
Captain, we never meant for things to get out of hand. We never accused you of being a shape-shifter, Mister Sisko. We were just carrying out our orders. All family members of Starfleet personnel are required to submit to blood screenings. No exceptions. Sir, that's not necessary. But sir.
