(very non-human) What are you going to do? Raimus told you to get the merchandise. Who should I bill this time? No, we billed them for last night's dinner. I will, in a minute. (O'Brien secretly points something at the comm. booth, and electricity leaps to Krole's dataport.) Look at this. Fused. (The dataport attachment.) I can't go to Raimus and ask him to pay for a replacement. Any feedback? Well, we'll see, won't we? (Krole plugs himself in.) Flith, go stand over there. I want to see if he really fixed this. He looks fine. You look fine, too. All right. I've accessed the bank's data files. I see it. You make it sound so easy. I'm past the lockouts. Stand by. Go. Faster. I can't hold the matrix open much longer. The lockouts are closing. I'm out.
