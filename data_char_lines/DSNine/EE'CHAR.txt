Here. Eat this. It'll help you feel better. It's chee'lash fruit. I'm the one who should be thanking you. I've been alone in here for six cycles. I know. It's a wonder I'm not insane. But you find ways to survive. Let me guess. Sedition? It looks like we're going to be in here together for a long time. My name is Ee'Char. Hello, Miles. Welcome to hell. [Corridor] For later. Oh, you find ways. I'd exercise, tell myself stories, draw eseekas on the ground. Geometric patterns. Drawing them is a way to relax your body and occupy the mind. Helps me. It's not easy. Here. This is a good spot. Start by drawing a circle. (O'Brien copies him) Now gaze into the circle. You want to learn or not? Relax your mind. Imagine that the circle encompasses your whole existence. Let it become a part of you. Now without thinking, allow your hand to make a mark inside the circle. Now expand on the mark. Let it grow organically until it becomes a pattern. You look like a reeta-hawk picking at a corpse. Awk! Awk! What, awk? Well, after six years in a place like this, you either learn to laugh or you go insane. I prefer to laugh. Sleep well, Miles. And if you feel like laughing in the middle of the night, go ahead. I'm a heavy sleeper. Tell me about Keiko again. About how much you like her eyes. Well, I like hearing about her. If I had a beautiful wife I'd talk about her, believe me. Besides, talking about her always relaxes you, and your pacing is getting a little distracting. Yeah. Since when? You didn't need to do that. Miles. Try to be calm. Miles! Miles! (Ee'Char grabs Miles and slams him against the wall, covering his mouth.) Listen. Be quiet! [Promenade] Miles. I've never really been gone, have I? That's all I ever was. But I'm real to you and that's all that matters. I can't. I'm your friend. You need me. You're wrong, Miles. You need me now more than ever. (Odo and Quark watch O'Brien.) [O'Brien's bedroom] (O'Brien is getting dressed when he sees Ee'Char's reflection in the mirror.) What are you doing? Miles, as your friend, I have to tell you I'm worried about you. Then why am I here? You should listen to him, Miles. He cares about you just like I did. Don't make the same mistake with him you did with me. Where are you going? Miles, please, don't do this. Go back there and talk to him. He wants to help you. That's right. We're both your friends. You know sooner or later you'll have to tell someone about me. You can't run from me forever. (Ee'char is in the next corridor) You want me to leave? I'll leave. Send me away. Don't you see? If I keep coming back, it's because some part of you keeps bringing me here. (And when O'Brien turns around, Ee'char is gone.) [O'Brien's quarters] Why did you do that? You need to concentrate more. So am I. Not unless you have a hiding place I don't know about. They've never let us go this long without food before. Then we die. I'm going to sleep. Maybe I'll dream about food. No. Just hungry. Now who's acting crazy? (They fight.) After all I've done for you. You ungrateful (O'Brien throws sand in Ee'Char's eyes and gets his hands round his throat. They roll around on the floor until we hear a cracking noise. O'Brien goes to the rag full of food and looks at it.) Miles. Be well, Miles. (Ee'Char walks away and vanishes.) [Corridor]
