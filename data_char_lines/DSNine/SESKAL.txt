You expect us to attack our own people? Are you going to ask him or not? It's a legitimate question, Garak. Well, if you won't ask him, I will. Odo, when you were the Head of Security on Terok Nor, what did you think was going to happen to the Bajoran prisoners you arrested? Ah. Well then, why didn't you resign in protest? (Kira throws her plate across the room.)
Orbital traffic control is asking for our security clearance. Yes. The transporter room is standing by. Good luck. (Kira, Garak and Damar leave) [Cave] (They beam in onto an upper ledge to the sound of weapons fire and shouting. They see Cardassians being shot by Jem'Hadar.) We're under attack! I can't lower the shields. Lock disruptors and return fire! Transfer the auxiliary power to (KaBOOM) [Cave]
