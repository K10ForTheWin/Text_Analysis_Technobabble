Good news, I take it. Excellent. Well done. I knew if our people stopped killing each other and worked together, we could put an end to these horrible weapons. This is a symbol of the new future we have embarked upon. At first we had questioned Doctor Nydrom's decision to bring in outside help. Obviously it was the right thing to do. We're all very grateful for your assistance. But eliminating the harvesters is only half the task. We must make certain all scientific data concerned with them is wiped out as well. Not quite. We shouldn't rest until the entire Kellerun and T'Lani supply of harvesters has been destroyed. We're sorry you had to share in our misfortune. It was a terrible accident. It appears one of your officers, a Chief O'Brien I believe, inadvertently tripped a security device. A lethal pulse of radiation flooded the room, killing everyone. I was able to return to the ship almost immediately after the accident. The first thing I did was to check the internal security sensors. They recorded the entire incident. We assumed you'd want to see for yourself. On the contrary, both he and Doctor Bashir will always be considered heroes to both the Kellerun and the T'Lani. Without their help, we never could have destroyed the harvesters. Not all of them. It's not enough to simply destroy the harvesters. We have to be sure no one can ever recreate them. As long as the knowledge exists, there's a danger it may be used. That's a risk we refuse to live with. Can we overtake them? Unfortunately, Commander, your officers are the only two people left who've seen the data concerning the development of the harvesters. Their intentions are irrelevant. The fact is, the threat remains as long as the knowledge exists. We'll do whatever we have to do to ensure our safety. He leaves us no choice. He must know his phasers can't hurt us. The man must be crazy. It's over. It can't just have disappeared. But we saw them die.
