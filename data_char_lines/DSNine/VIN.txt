Okay buddy, come on, rise and shine. Come on. Well, look what we have here. Who am I? Do you believe this? Sleeping Beauty's asking me questions. Up. What are you, an anarchist? There's a law against sleeping in the streets. Though I do like the matching pajamas. All right, let's see some logo. ID. Identification. UHC Card? Transit pass? Oh, perfect. Just what we need. Two more dims. Yeah, probably from the last time you were in a Sanctuary District. How do they find us? (We pan down the Trans Bay tube 2 subway steps to an unconscious Dax, who still has her comm. badge unlike Sisko and Bashir. After the opening titles, she is woken by a passerby.) All right, let's go. Bring them. Hold it right there. (to Bernardo) If you want to go home, go home. What do I care? Shall we? [Chris's office] (Meanwhile, Dax is seeing how the other half live, using a pointer on a touchscreen.) Left hand. Other hand. Look straight ahead. Now stand over here. Yeah, yeah. Save the commercial. No ID, no fingerprint record, no Interface account. It's like you two don't exist. Yeah, well, let's see. You don't have any ID, you don't have any money, and you're both dressed like clowns. You figure it out. (Vin gives them clipboards with forms) Please fill out these forms. Answer all questions to the best of your ability. If you cannot speak English an interpreter will be provided. If you cannot read, questions will be given to you verbally. If there is any part of this form you do not understand, ask one of our staff for assistance. Now sit down, shut up, and fill out the forms. And if you've got any problems, don't come to me with them. I got one word for you, pal. Plenty of overtime. Hey, for a dim, you're pretty smart. Now go back and take a seat. Oh boy. (A calendar on the wall says today is Friday 8/30/24, temperature 15 degrees, and Sisko is thinking.) Hey, I hate to break up your intimate conversation, but you're next. [Processing Centre - Cubicle]
Drop your weapons. What's so funny? I know you. I picked you up the other day. Leave her alone. Get lost. What are you doing? Sit down. Why should they? You're all a bunch of losers. You heard me. I called you a loser because that's what you are. And this time, you're going to lose big. Check your e-mail, buddy. You're a loser, too. I just want these guys to know what they're in for. I bet the National Guard's already has this place surrounded. Sooner or later they'll come rolling right in here, and you people aren't even going to slow them down. Hey, leave her alone. Yeah, then you and I can see how tough you really are. Hey! [Processing Centre - Lee's cubicle] You trying to scare me? If you're so concerned about our welfare, why don't you let us go? What do you want me to say? That I feel for them? That they got a bad break? What good would it do? Let him see it. (Bernardo hands over the photo.) Nice looking bunch, huh? Biddle? I didn't say a word. Best ball club I ever saw? The ninety nine Yankees, no doubt about it. Come on. Tennis? It's up to you, Bell. That's all they had going for them. Stop shooting, damn it! We're okay! (There's a red dot on Vin's chest, so Sisko steps forward.) I'm a hostage, you idiot! What's wrong with you people? You could've gotten us all killed. Do I look dead to you? Yeah? Well you certainly did a good job. (Bashir goes to tend to Sisko) Leave him alone. You go pacify Second Street. Officer Calvera and I can handle things in here. Give me that. (A gun for Bernardo.) How is he? Gotcha. How could we have let this happen? I don't know. All right. They saved our lives back there. Give me your ID cards. We'll switch these with two of the casualties. As far as anybody knows, you both died here. Is that okay with you, Bell? My pleasure. Anything else we can do for you? Name it. I would've done that anyway. First officer's log, supplemental. Upon returning to the present with our missing crewmembers, we were relieved to discover that the timeline had been restored. [Sisko's cabin]
