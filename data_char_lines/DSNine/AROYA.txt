Here I come. (A Bajoran woman comes out, trying on a new dress.) What do you think? Oh, well then, put it on my account. I'll wear it to work. I own the Celestial Cafe, the new Bajoran restaurant overlooking the Promenade. I watch you walk by every morning when you're on patrol. Oh nine thirty seven. You're very precise. I was hoping one day you might stop in when you're not working. I do, and I hate to eat alone. Think about it. Oh, and next time you're on the second level, don't forget to say hello. (Aroya leaves) There you are, Odo. I've been looking all over for you. I heard about what happened. I'm so sorry. I know it won't be easy, but eventually you'll see how being a humanoid has its advantages. If there's anything at all I can do, just let me know. (Aroya leaves)
