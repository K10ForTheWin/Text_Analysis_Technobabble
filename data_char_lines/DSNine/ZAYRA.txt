It's just that the murdered man, Ibudan, I spoke to him yesterday about an hour before it happened. Quark's. By the dabo table. It was after his scuffle with the shape-shifter. He told me that he was scared. He was afraid that Odo might kill him. Maybe so. All I know is, an hour later, Ibudan was dead. [Ibudan's quarters] (On board a Bajoran ship docked at DS9.) What do we know about him anyway? He's not one of us. You know what really bothers me? This shifter was the last Chief of Security when the Cardassians were here. Why is he still Security Chief? I can't believe you're defending him, Quark. You're his worst enemy. Security, huh? [Ibudan's quarters] (Bashir is vacuuming up samples of debris in the room) [Ops] We're not saying whether he's innocent or guilty, Commander. All we're saying is isn't it reasonable under the circumstances that he Shape-shifting freak. (Odo retreats to the security office while the mob gathers outside.) Freak! Murdering shifter. (leading the chant) Shifter! Shifter! Shifter! Shifter! (Phasers are being handed out.) He's right. How do you get a rope around the neck of a shape-shifter. We condemn him because of the evidence.
