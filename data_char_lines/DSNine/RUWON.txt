(heavy-set male) I am Ruwon. This is Karina. We're ready for your report on the Dominion. We are not interested in your accommodations, Commander. We are here for your intelligence briefing. Nothing else. The Dominion represents the greatest threats to the Alpha Quadrant in the last century. We need more information on its military capabilities. How many ships do they have? Where are they deployed? What are their plans for the future? Are they planning an attack? And Odo is a changeling. I fail to see the distinction. We find that hard to believe. Commander, we allowed you to place one of our cloaking devices on the Defiant in exchange for information regarding the Dominion. Now you have the cloaking device and we have very little. Very well then. We want to see every piece of information Starfleet has on the Dominion, no matter how insignificant. Then do it. [Promenade - upper level] You seem very agitated for someone who's proclaiming her innocence. Why didn't Odo try to help the rest of the Defiant's crew? Do you often have personal talks with the changeling? We're trying to determine the nature of your relationship. Has Odo ever shown some kind of physical interest in you, Major? I think you're lying, Quark. All of it. I think it's time we left.
