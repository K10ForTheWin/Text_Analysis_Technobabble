Okay then. In the ship? See you there. Bye. (Elizabeth Lense walks straight past Julian as if she never even saw him) [Bajoran ship] Yes? You're Bashir? Well, I thought you were Andorian. Someone pointed out an Andorian to me at a party and said that that was Julian Bashir. It was New Year's Eve at Bruce Lucier's, four years ago. Yes. (Bashir sits.) I must've gotten you mixed up. All these years, I thought you were someone else. No, I was backstage waiting to give my speech. I was so nervous I almost passed out. So. You gave me quite a run for my money. If it hadn't been for that pre-ganglionic fibre I know that if you hadn't got that wrong you would be valedictorian. Seems like a long time ago, doesn't it? Actually, it ended up being more of a charting expedition. Sometimes it would be months between planetary systems. You wouldn't believe how excited I would get if we actually found something living, even if it was just moss under a rock. Don't take this the wrong way but, there were times when I regretted not taking your assignment. I read your paper on the immuno-therapy project you've been doing on Bajor. It was brilliant. I really envy the opportunity you have to work on that kind of long-term project. On the Lexington, it was collect your samples and then on to the next system. What's happening on Bajor? Were you able to get the T-cell anomalies under control? I'd love it. (So they leave together, smiling. Leaning over the upper rail - )
