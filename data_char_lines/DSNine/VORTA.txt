I hope I didn't get you gentlemen out of bed. Is that the extent of your security precautions? If you say so. So, this is Bilby. He seems capable enough. I wanted to see for myself. You procured the disruptors for us. We're going to ask you to do something else. Something very important. I hope so. We'll contact you when it's time. Raimus. Which one is it? Wait. Don't tell me. Let me see if I can guess. They say you can tell a traitor by looking in his eyes. Do you think that's true, Bilby? If you ask me, none of them look particularly trustworthy. Him. (pointing at O'Brien.) He was going to be my second guess. Well, now that that's out of the way, shall we discuss the matter at hand? So accommodating. He reminds me of a Jem'Hadar. And you'll use the disruptors you procured earlier. It's all right. Very astute. Do you know much about political affairs? Well then, allow me to enlighten you. The Ambassador has been advocating that the Klingons break off their alliance with the Federation and concentrate on defending the Empire against the Dominion. Chancellor Gowron, on the other hand, is adamantly committed to the alliance. Exactly. The Ambassador will be seen as a martyr and his cause will gain strength. If all goes well, the Klingons will retreat into their own territory and then all we'll have to deal with is the Federation. I'm glad you think so. Needless to say, it is very important that the Dominion's part in this remain secret. I never realised how much the Dominion and the Orion Syndicate have in common. It seems that in both organisations, loyalty is everything. [Alley]
