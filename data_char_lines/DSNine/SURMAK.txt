This is Doctor Surmak. And you are? Ah yes, the old Cardassian mining station. How can I help you? On what? I have no idea what you're talking about. (Transmission ends) [Commander's office] This is Doctor Surmak. I have nothing to say to you (And as he stands up Kira beams him aboard the runabout) This is outrageous. I demand you return me to my office immediately. Major, this is kidnapping. Turn this ship around or I swear you'll spend the rest of your life in Kran-Tobol Prison. Why come to me? No, I had practically nothing to do with it. Dekon Elig created the virus. I was merely his medical assistant. That seems like a lifetime ago now. I was only in the underground for six months before we were captured. I am not responsible for this. I don't know of any antidote. If Dekon made one, he never told me. I sympathise, Major. But I don't think I can help you. Meaning what? First thing I need to see is your Doctors' viral characterisation research. He was beginning to develop an antidote series. Let's take a look at that. I think you'd better sit down, Major. [Docking port five] (Jaheel is on the floor with his ship on fire behind him. Odo hauls him through the airlock to safety) Virus protein sheath. Nucleotide sequence. Yes, that's right. It's an adaptive, synaptic inhibitor. Dekon was brilliant, no doubt of that. I think we've found your antidote, Major. [Docking port five]
