Mister Webb, I'm Detective Preston from the SFPD. It's urgent that I speak with you. I'm afraid it's department policy in these types of situations, but it does give us a chance to talk one-on-one First, I want to see the hostages. I need to make sure they're okay. You said you weren't going to hurt them. I need to know I can count on that. I'd say so. Look, if you don't mind, I'd like to speak with Mister Webb again. Your friend has quite a temper.
