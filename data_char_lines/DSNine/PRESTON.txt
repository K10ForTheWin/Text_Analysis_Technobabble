Mister Webb, I'm Detective Preston from the SFPD. It's urgent that I speak with you. I'm afraid it's department policy in these types of situations, but it does give us a chance to talk one-on-one First, I want to see the hostages. I need to make sure they're okay. You said you weren't going to hurt them. I need to know I can count on that. I'd say so. Look, if you don't mind, I'd like to speak with Mister Webb again. Your friend has quite a temper. It's been a long night for all of us. You guys must be exhausted. Breakfast for ten thousand? That's a lot of take-out. But in the interest of friendship, I'll do what I can. Now, how about returning the favour and letting me have one of the hostages? Not at all. You'll get the food either way. Giving up one of the hostages would show good faith. Besides, you'd still have five left. Which is what? That's asking a lot. Obviously I can't make any promises, but I will see to it the Governor hears your demands. The Governor assures me that if you let the hostages go, he'll reduce the charges against you to incitement to riot. The Governor intends to form a committee to look into the problems facing the District residents. I wouldn't say that. But change takes time. Gentlemen, if I were you I would seriously consider taking this offer. The Governor is not going to let this situation continue forever. Governor, I understand your concern, but I think the use of force would be premature at this time. I am aware that there have been disturbances in other Sanctuary Districts, but we have to think about the hostages. I know I've heard the rumours too, but that's all they are, rumours. If you just give me another chance to talk with Webb and Bell, I. Yes, sir. Of course. We'll do our best. (She puts down the phone.) The Governor's made up his mind. We move in at oh five hundred.
