Humans! I never thought I'd see another normal face again. Barry. Call me Barry. I'm a merchant. I deal in gemstones, kivas and trillium mostly. May I? You know what Cardassians drink in the morning? Fish juice. Hot fish juice. Raktajino. After six months, I was hoping the Klingons would invade. At least they know how to make coffee, even if they are foul-smelling barbarians. Sorry.
