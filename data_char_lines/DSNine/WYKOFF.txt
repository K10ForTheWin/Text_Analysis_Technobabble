Mister Russell. (Sisko is holding a pencil.) Mister Russell, put it down. I said, put down the pencil. Put it down, Mister Russell. (Played by Casey Biggs, aka Damar.) Mister Russell, you promised not to write on the walls. I thought we agreed that you weren't going to write at all. That you needed to rest. You were doing so well, Benny. Making real progress. We were all so proud of you. We're going to send you home as soon as you're well. But you're not fine. People who are fine don't write on walls. You're not listening. The stories have got to stop, Benny. They're too dangerous. To you. This world you've created, this Deep Space Nine. Captain Sisko and Kira and the others. None of it is real. It doesn't matter, Benny. The Prophets don't exist either. They're all figments of your imagination. Get rid of them. It's the only way that you're going to get well. Now give me the pencil, Benny. It's over. Just let it go. [Desert] (Sisko is sitting with his hands on the box.) Take it, Benny. I'm offering you an opportunity few people ever get. You can wipe away all your mistakes. They're only words. Meaningless words that no one cares about. Get rid of them and you can walk out of here a free man. (The last line on the wall says 'Sisko reaches for the Orb box and ) Go ahead. Save yourself. (Benny holds the paint roller close to the writing.) [Desert] It's for your own good, Benny. Wipe away the words. Destroy them before they destroy you. [Desert] No! (Benny punches Wykoff and the male nurse, picks up his pencil and writes 'Opens it.') [Desert] (Sisko obeys. The glow of the crystal orb shoots of into space, then) [Limbo] (Sisko watches the energy shoots past DS9 and WHOOSH! the wormhole reopens.) [Bajoran ship bridge]
