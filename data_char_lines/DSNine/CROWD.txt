We believe in you, Sirah. Help us, Sirah. Save us, Sirah. (He goes up a rocky promontory as a strong wind starts to blow) The Dal'Rok. The Dal'Rok. We can do it. The village is strong. The village is strong. (Light particles come from the village and attack the cloud) The village is strong. More powerful than the Dal'Rok. Drive it away. Drive it away! Drive it away! (The cloud shrinks and vanishes.) Sirah, just a moment. Sirah, please come back. [Sirah's chamber] (O'Brien is checking every item and ornament when Hovath opens the door) There he is. Sirah, you'll save us. Tell the story. (O'Brien goes onto the rock as the wind picks up.)
Blessings on the Kai. May the Prophets guide you.
Dabo! (And another spin.) Dabo! (Mardah hands the winnings to the lucky punter and Jake blows her a kiss.) Dabo! (The winner takes his money.)
Dabo!
Dabo! (O'Brien's body is on the table.)
Dabo!
Dabo! (The never ending darts tournament continues.)
Dabo! (Quark dashes away.)
Dabo!
