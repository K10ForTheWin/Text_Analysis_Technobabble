Cadet Shepard reporting as ordered, Captain. Yes, sir. Record, sir? We were told that there was not going to be any written record. No, sir. The briefing officer, sir. She didn't give us her name, sir, but she did say there would be no record of our actions and that our role would have to go unrecognised, at least for now. With all due respect, sir, that's not true, sir. The mission went perfectly. If anything, it was easier than the simulations. I'm not lying to you, sir. I was there. I was at Planetary Operations the whole time. If anything had gone wrong, I would have known about it. Yes, sir. We assembled on the Eastern Quad at seventeen hundred hours on the evening of the twenty third. Yes, sir. After assembly we were beamed aboard the Lakota. Once aboard we received our equipment and the necessary codes, and were transported directly to the Division of Planetary Operations in Lisbon. Oh four hundred hours exactly, local time of course. Our contact inside the DPO gave us access to their computer control network. From there we used the access codes we were given, bypassed the security lockouts, and downloaded the disordering protocols into the network. It was a pretty impressive sight, sir, watching those relays wink out one after another. After that, all we had to do was sabotage the restart sequencers and get out. Like I said, sir, it was all by the numbers. [Sisko's restaurant] (Nighttime.)
Aye, sir.
