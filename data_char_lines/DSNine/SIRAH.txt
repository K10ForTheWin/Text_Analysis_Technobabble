The Dal'Rok. Hovath. The time? You should have wakened me. Help me get dressed. The Prophets sent you, didn't they. No, there's something wrong. It must be your companion. Bring him to me. Because you are not the one I have been waiting for. Come. Closer. (takes O'Brien's hand) I knew. I knew the Prophets would not fail us. You may leave now. Both of you. Your concern touches me, Doctor. But I am now in the hands of the Prophets. The Dal'Rok wakes. But we are ready. In the shadow of the night, he hungers. With a hatred of the ancients, he rages. From the twisted pit of chaos, he approaches. (a cloud has appeared from nowhere) The Dal'Rok's anger is like a wave crashing down on the village. The weight of its fury threatens to crush us all. The Dal'Rok thinks the village is powerless to defend itself. (Lightning flashes) But the Dal'Rok is mistaken. The village is strong, much stronger than the Dal'Rok can ever imagine. With our strength, our unity, we shall drive the Dal'Rok (The old man collapses and the stream of light stops. The Dal'Rok's lightning blows up a building.) Where is my successor? No, the one whom the prophets sent. Yes, you. Say as I say. The village shall not be destroyed. Quickly. Louder, so they can all hear. Despite our fears, we shall stand our ground and face the Dal'Rok.
