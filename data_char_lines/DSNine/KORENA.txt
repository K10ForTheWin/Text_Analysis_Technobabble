I'm back. (Not quite as far in the future. Korena is an artist and Nog is in red TNG uniform and Tony is out of the age makeup.) Nog. I didn't realise you were here already. I was trying to finish a painting before the light changed and I guess the time got away from me. You too. Did you start the grill? Blackened redfish fresh from the bayou. I suppose you're going to ask me to chew your food for you? I'm going to get some champagne. I see you've got another pip on your collar. You keep that up you're going to make captain by the time you're forty. Well, why don't we get to the point of today's little celebration. Coming to bed? (taking the pen from his hand.) Neither am I. Do you mean it? (There's a blue light.) What was that? (Sisko is lying behind the couch.) I talked to someone at Starfleet Science. They're going to get a team here as soon as they can. I never thought I'd have the pleasure of meeting you. We were married in New Orleans, in your father's restaurant. I have a feeling you might want to see these. They're Jake's. (Korena takes two books from a shelf - Anselm and Collected Stories.)
