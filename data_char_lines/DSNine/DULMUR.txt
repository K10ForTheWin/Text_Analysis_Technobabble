I'm Dulmur. (An anagram of Muldur, and yes - ) Where's Captain Sisko? [Captain's office] Just the truth, Captain. The beginning. Captain, why did you take the Defiant back in time? A time loop. That you were meant to go back into the past? Good. Is that a joke? We hate those too. All right, Captain. Whenever you're ready. Orb? Be specific, Captain. Which Enterprise? There've been five. His ship. The man was a menace. What was the date of your arrival? A hundred and five years, one month, and twelve days ago. What was the Enterprise doing? [Orb cabin] Your men could've avoided that fight, Captain. How do you know that? For all we know, we could be living in an alternate timeline right now. So, your men were arrested. {Enterprise briefing room] And that's when you returned the present? However, I don't think there was any harm done. Probably would have done the same thing myself. [Ops] You'll be receiving our report in about a month. But based on what you've told us, I don't think you have anything to worry about. Goodbye, Captain.
