(J G Hertzler) Okay, friends and neighbours. Let's see what Uncle Roy has for you today. This is Mister Pabst's favourite. Honeymoon on Andoras. (A bug eyed monster climbing over the ledge of a building, where a buxom beauty is sunbathing.) What? So I had too much sauerkraut on my franks that night. What can I say? Thank you. These Cardassians, I like the way you describe them, especially the neck ridges. I'm going to do some sketches for you to take a look at. Make a nice cover.
