(the other Klingon) Go on. What are you waiting for? (Verad puts a box on the floor and opens it.) You Ferengi, you think you're so clever but you're stupid. Go right ahead. Stupid Ferengi. [Ops] Enough of your whining. Why bother? She'll be dead in a few hours anyway. Why should I? She let herself be slaughtered like a mindless t'gla. If she wanted to live, she should have fought back. Then she is a fool and she deserves her fate. So the little human has some spark after all. (Yeto takes the device and waves it over Jadzia's belly while Bashir gives her a hypo) Stop whining or I'll put you out of your misery. I'm not your nurse.
