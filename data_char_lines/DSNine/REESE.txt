Does that include the Bajoran security detachment, sir? Aye, sir. The replicators have been secured in the ship's hold, sir. Me, sir? No, sir. It's just that it's unusual for a junior officer to be left in You can count on me, Commander. Yes, sir. (Reese leaves the airlock. Eddington takes off him comm. badge and puts it on the bulkhead before the door seals behind him.) Captain's log, supplemental. The Defiant has returned to the station but it seems that Commander Eddington is still one step ahead of us. [Ops]
Take it easy, Vargas. Find one and you disappear. You're wasting your breath, Vargas. It's not the Captain's problem. He's leaving. They're out there. You're supposed to be listening for the Jem'Hadar. Then shut up and listen. There's something wrong. They're not firing. Holograms. And pinpoint our positions. No one asked your opinion. Right. Don't shoot. It's me, Reese! Jem'Hadar patrol. She's dead. The Ferengi found the encampment. It's three kilometres south of here. Two columns. Any ideas? Captain. The kid did all right. [Base camp infirmary] This is their camp. This is ours. There are mountains to the east and west which means they have to come through this ravine to get to us. Make sure it's lots of movement. We want that ravine full of Jem'Hadar when those Houdinis start to go off. That should take out a third of their forces. They've become a whole lot friendlier. Power packs. Relax. When they get here, you'll know it. (Reese moves along the line.) Power packs. (Next to Sisko, Kellin is flicking his rifle sight up and down.) You alive? Captain, are you with us? Those were our orders, sir. [Bunker] (Sisko is staring at the Dominion device, the cause of all this trouble.) Children. Let's go.
