What's your pleasure? You're the second person today who's ordered that. What is it? An older man. A human. I don't know. He left about an hour ago. I think he said he'd be back. We don't have any Klingon beverages. Would you like something else? Okay. What'll it be, boys? And don't ask for raktajino. If I have to say we don't carry that one more time The Klingons. Over there, and over there. All right. You boys have had enough.
Good evening.
