Calm down. I just don't want you to get upset. It's only for a few weeks, Patrick. Stop it, Jack. He's just trying to scare you. Don't listen to him. I told you why I brought you here, remember? To meet that doctor, Doctor Bashir? He was genetically enhanced when he was a boy, just like all of you. It's going to be all right. Doctor Bashir is going to work with you for a while, that's all. Just think of it as a little vacation from the Institute. It is happening, Jack, and you're going to have to try to make the best of it. Give me the PADD. (He drags the broken plastic across her hand, cutting it.) You're not sorry, we both know that. You did it on purpose because you're upset. But there are better ways of dealing with being upset. All right. Well, I'll see you all in a few weeks. (Patrick comes in for a hug.) Patrick, it's fine, it's fine. Go on. (She goes over to a silent, ghost-like girl standing by the door.) Bye, Sarina. (Sarina turns and examines the bulkhead.) [Corridor] It's nothing. Just another run in with Jack. Like I said in my report, don't turn your back on him.
