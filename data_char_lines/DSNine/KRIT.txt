Tell me, you like surprises, Quark? I like to think I'm pleasant. You think I'm pleasant? Then I guess this qualifies as a pleasant surprise. My brother and I were business associates of Morn's. I understand you inherited Morn's estate. He borrowed some money from us, and we'd like the estate to repay the loan. One thousand bricks of gold pressed latinum. We shook hands. And I'm sure he'd want you to honour his word. I hope you're not saying you don't have the money. So you do know where it is. We're not? What can we expect? What sort of percentage? We can't accept less than eighty. We'll take seventy. We can't take less than sixty. Fifty. I'm glad we were able to come to an understanding. We'll be watching you, Quark. Don't try anything. What's your hurry? My brother has something he wants to say to you. He feels terrible. That's nice of you to be so forgiving, Quark. My brother has a nasty temper. It comes out when things don't go our way. That's why I'm hoping things start to go our way soon. Do you understand what I'm saying, Quark? That's good to hear. Quark. We've been looking all over for you. That's good news. We were getting worried. (Doorbell.) Expecting anyone? Don't answer it. (Lock picking noises.) Whoever it is, get rid of them. We'll be over there. Well look what we have here. Royal family? What kind of lies you been telling him, Hain? Nine years. I can see that. Yes, but then he ran off with the latinum. Not you, us. It should look like an accident. We don't want anyone asking questions. It's still a lot of latinum. It wasn't us. Put it down, Hain. My brother may be slow, but if you pull that trigger, he'll kill you. Nahsk? What are you doing? (Krit backs away. Larell and Hain turn on each other.) We're family. Just put the gun down. (Nahsk fires at Krit who can now dive behind a barrel. Larell fires and misses and everyone goes for cover. Quark dives inside the crate and the hatch closes behind him.) [Crate] (We can see flashes of weapons fire through the crate hatch.)
