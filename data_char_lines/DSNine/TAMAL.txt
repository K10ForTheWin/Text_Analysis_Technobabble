Right. The rest of the team's ready. The Maquis ships are heading for the border, Tom. Squadron Baker has arrived at their checkpoint. We took six hits on the port shields. There's been some minor damage to the outer hull but all systems are operational. It looks like two plasma conduits blew out. Deck three, section fifteen. Crew quarters. The cloak is operating within normal parameters but the plasma conduit damage has caused a slight neutrino leak in the port nacelle. The Cardassians might be able to detect it even through the cloak. We're approaching the first cruiser. They'll be in phaser range in fifteen seconds. We've been hit on our starboard shield. (Boom) Shields holding. Torpedoes locked on target. Tom, three more cruisers have just appeared in the Orias system. That makes five ships ahead of us and ten behind. Incoming message
