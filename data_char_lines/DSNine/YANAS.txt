We've been worried about you. Well that's a relief. I'd hate to have to start calling you Curzon. Oh? Ezri Dax. Of course it is. I haven't been away from Trill that long. The important thing is you're doing well. I'll do everything I can. Now. When are you coming home? Ezri, you haven't been home in three years. Ezri Tigan. Dax. You tell your commanding officer that your mother is a very difficult woman, and that she refuses to help look for Mister O'Brien unless you're allowed to return home right away. Ezri, goodbye. I'll see you when you get here. [Corridor]
