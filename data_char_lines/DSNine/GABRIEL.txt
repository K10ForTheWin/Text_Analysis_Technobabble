(a boy) Are you the son of Mogh? Is it true you can kill someone just by looking at them? They're here! They're here! The Klingons! (A group of people with varying amounts of ridges, including none.) I'm going to be one of them someday. I'll ride a wild torga and go hunting, and only come to the settlement to trade furs for the things I need. Miranda, is something wrong? Everyone's so quiet. To the fields. It's time for planting. (They walk on to where everyone is getting the young plants ready for the ground.)
