This is Commander Kaybok of the M'Char. What is it you want? We have orders to search all vessels attempting to leave Bajoran space. For shape-shifters. Each ship will be scanned, its cargo searched, and its crewmembers and passengers subjected to genetic testing. On the authority of Gowron and the Klingon High Council. We assumed you would welcome our assistance. How can we have evidence until we conduct our tests? I have my orders. (transmission ends) Captain, this is outrageous. We are your allies. Kltrek im stram. Gowron will hear of this.
