So, you are the leader of the aliens. Federation? It matters to me. Such a noble purpose. There'll be no reward for our release, you know. A fool who always manages to outwit you, Shel-la, as I have proven over and over again. We're listening. The two of you seem to have discussed this plan in detail. Explain why you choose to ally yourself with the Ennis. One of your people fired a weapon at us. I think you're lying. I don't know the alien, but I know Shel-la. I know how his mind works. I promise you this is an Ennis trick to lure our entire population out of hiding so they can be slaughtered. Then the Ennis are surely willing to make the first gesture of peace. Let them bring all of their people out of hiding first to prove their honourable intention. No more than I would let an Ennis go free. (So Zlangco gets speared in the stomach and a general fight breaks out. Shel-La gets skewed too and Bashir knocks Sisko out of the way before he gets hit over the head.)
