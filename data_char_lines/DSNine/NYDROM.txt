Coming up to full power. Muon generator now at full power. It took ten years to perfect the harvesters. We've only been trying to eliminate them for a week. The genetic integrity of the sample is holding steady. I'm not reading any genetic disruption at all. The results are identical. The harvesters have been destroyed. (Sharat enters - a different race to Nydrom) Ambassador Sharat, I'm pleased to inform you that we have found a way to eliminate the harvesters. Yes. And let's not forget, we couldn't have done it without the help of our friends from the Federation. Then it's finished. The last cylinder. I believe that you should have the honour, Doctor. It's ironic, isn't it, that the war would finally come to an end up here, above T'Lani Three, a planet whose entire population was decimated by harvesters. I hope this will be a lasting peace. (Two armed men from the same race as Sharat enter) What is this? Weapons aren't allowed up here. (He gets shot. Everyone dives for cover as the gunfire continues. The scientists are massacred, O'Brien tackles the one about to shoot Bashir and gets his weapon. Bashir goes for the other one, and a shot blows up the console with the harvester cylinder in it. A drop of stuff lands on O'Brien's arm. Bashir knocks the man out and they check the others. O'Brien locks down the doors.) The last cylinder. I believe you should have the honour, Doctor. The harvesters have been destroyed. We must make certain that all records of their existence are wiped out. Then it's finished. (O'Brien takes a drink from his mug) No. Maybe you should try cutting the power. Then it's finished.
