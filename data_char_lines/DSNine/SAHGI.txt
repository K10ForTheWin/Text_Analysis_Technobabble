(little girl) Peldor joi, Emissary. Come on, you guys. Mommy, look. Isn't it pretty? (Odo enters) Emissary! My mother says all the Orbs are dark, that the Prophets have abandoned us. You have to find them, Emissary. You have to ask them to come back.
Excuse me, Emissary. I wanted to congratulate both of you. Everybody's talking about it. Can I be one of your dais bearers? For the bridal procession. I know you can only choose fifty one girls, but it would be such an honour for me. People are saying it's going to be the biggest wedding Bajor's ever seen. The Emissary's getting married.
