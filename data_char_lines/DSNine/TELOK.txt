Intendant! (a Klingon) This Terran was caught trying to stow away on one of the freighters leaving the station. After four years as a personal guard for the House of Duras, I was ready to do anything to get out of there. You never knew if Lursa and B'Etor were going to do (His arm is jolted by one of Sisko's crewmen and his drink is spilled.) Clumsy fool. (knock the human down) Stupid Terran pig! (But the Terran brandishes a sharp knife at Telok. Sisko shakes his head so the knife is put away again.) What's wrong, Terran? Lost your nerve? Afraid to die today, eh? (Telok spits in his face. The Terran looks at Sisko who signals 'no'.) Get out of my sight. (The Terran gets out, and Sisko goes to stare Telok in the eyes when the Intendant enters, identically dressed like Kira but with her head band on.) Stop right there. [Quark's] Intendant. The new Terran killed the shape-shifter and O'Brien tried to help him escape.
