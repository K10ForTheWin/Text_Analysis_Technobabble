Perhaps you didn't hear me. There are no Bajoran prisoners left in Cardassian hands. There are, of course, people being detained at the Justice Ministry for crimes against the state, but that is a discussion for another time. Now, I would like to discuss what you've called war reparations. We would be willing to pay for the destruction of all Bajoran property incurred during the occupation as long as you would be willing to return to us all Cardassian property and equipment left behind on Bajor. I can provide you with lists of material, equipment, as long as we have an agreement in principle that anything of Cardassian origin does still belong to the Cardassian people. Good. Shall we take a recess? (Turrel leaves.)
