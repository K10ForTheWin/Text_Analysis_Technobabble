(older, stouter) They're from Starfleet. The uniforms have changed, or have I just forgotten what they looked like? My name is Joseph. Vinod's the one playing with the sharp object. Our group was on its way to settle on Gemulon Five over ten years ago when our ship developed life support problems, and we had to land here for repairs. We've been stuck here ever since, and I guess you are too now. After ten years, this is our home. Well, we still do. Come, we'll show you. Vinod, run ahead and tell your mother we have guests. Come. [Compound] (A former spaceship is the main building. The people are in simple home-made clothes for agrarian living.) Commissioned the Santa Maria. Now, we just call it the Cabin. Alixus, meet Ben and Miles. A runabout. Is that some kind of new Starfleet vessel? I was the engineer aboard the Santa Maria. On Deep Space Nine? Without a functional tricorder, it was virtually impossible to track down the source. We threw it away. Well, since none of it worked, to us it was merely useless junk taking up space. Well, we all had to abandon our dependence on technology. Removing every trace of it, well, that made the transition easier. I was the last convert. But as time passed, I realised Alixus was right. She was helping us discover a new philosophy of life together, because we needed one to survive. And I'll tell you, every one of us is better for it. We're more committed to each other. We are truly a part of each other's lives. We've renewed a sense of community that man left behind centuries ago. The new herb doesn't seem to be helping at all. Please. We've searched everywhere for the right fungus or root that would draw out the infection. Do you really think you could? What? Why? A botanist? Really? Maybe you'll bring her someday. That's okay too. (A man is being released from a metal box out in the glare of the sun. He's shaking and cannot stand on his own.) Get him into the shade. (O'Brien and Sisko go to the box then follow Joseph and the group to a shaded area) [Compound] Here, Stephan, chew these. They'll help you regain your strength. He stole a candle. Since yesterday. Alixus, I'm sure he only wanted to get to the medical equipment that might have saved Meg's life. Miles? What are you doing here? With what? There's nothing I can do, so please don't ask me. We told you there are astetine deposits. And you want me to look the other way while you leave? Miles Then it was no accident we developed life support problems near this planet. Miles, this is our home. Whatever Alixus may be guilty of, she did give us our community. I'm not sure if we'll leave the device on or off now that we know it's there. And we'll have to decide if we want to establish contact with the outside world. But Alixus is right. We have found something here that none of us is willing to give up. Come. Come. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® and related marks are trademarks of CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Wait until you see the size of the eggplant I'm getting out of my garden this year. As big as Crenshaw melons and twice as heavy. (Everyone say Hi! to  Brock Peters, previously seen as Admiral Cartwright.) I sent her home to Portland. Your sister's got her own life to worry about. Besides, she never puts enough cayenne pepper in the jambalaya. Which means she has no business in the kitchen. It'll be good to have you home again, Benjamin. Jake too. Whatever you do during the day is your business. But at dinner time, you better get yourself down to New Orleans. No son of mine is going to eat that replicated slop Starfleet calls food. Not if I have anything to say about it. Oh, let's not start that again. The doctors say I am a medical marvel. At the rate things are going in another year or two I won't have an original organ left in my body. They'll write me up in the medical books. Just point me in the direction of a party and a pretty girl and I'll show you how good I feel. Make sure you call me as soon as you and Jake get here. Your rooms are always waiting and ready for you.
It'll be good to have you home again, Benjamin.
You did what? You mean you didn't leave my grandson at the mercy of a vicious, bloodthirsty enemy? Then it's certainly just as bad as it sounds. Oh, so now you're going to blame this on Jake. I don't care who's responsible. It's wrong and I want him back. You think he's all right? When? Tell them you want to go get your son. All right. It's been three weeks since I've poisoned anyone. Are things really as bad as the news service claims? Well you certainly know how to comfort a frightened old man. I raised you to be a chef, for all the good it did me. You know, there's something I just don't understand. You're always telling me that space is big, that it's an endless frontier filled with infinite wonders. Well if that's the case, you would think it would be more than enough room to allow people to leave each other alone. I'd better be going. The lunch crowd's coming in. You watch yourself, Ben. And bring me back my grandson. I love you.
Well, it certainly is big. (Kira leaves.) I heard about Quentin Swofford. I'm sorry. I didn't come here to be entertained. I came to see you and Jake. Well, I figured it was now or never. Besides, I've been worried about you. Last couple of times we've talked it seemed like you were carrying the weight of the entire Alpha Quadrant on your shoulders. Just say it, son. So what do you want to do? I see. No one is indispensable, son. Not even you. Whatever decision you make, I'll support. Of course, if Quentin Swofford was here I'd bet he'd have a few things to say to you. I'd say you have some thinking to do, and I've got a dinner date with my grandson, so you'd better get to it. (A man in a 1950's suit walks past the door. It's Rene Auberjonois.) Who? Thank God. Visions? Does this have something to do with those Prophets you're always telling me about? Seemed like forever to me. How're you feeling, son? I'm done packing. Transport leaves at eight in the morning. I've got to get back to the restaurant. My customers have never gone this long without me. The question is, what are you going to do? I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith. I'm full of surprises, aren't I? And so are you. Sounds like that dream you had helped you sort things out. That's a scary thought.
If I were you, I'd order the crawfish etoufee. And if it's good enough for you, it's good enough for him. I think table five is ready to order. Customers seem to like it. Look, I'm worried too, but he's got something to work out. Best we leave him alone. Ask me what? Where'd you get that? No one at all, you hear me? She's no one at all. [Las Vegas lounge] (Worf can't sleep.) You should be in bed. I already told you. She's no one. Leave it be, Ben. That's impossible. You couldn't have. I'm sorry, but I don't want to talk about it. No! Her name was Sarah. I met her in June of '31. It was in Jackson Square. She was, without a doubt, the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. Two months later, we were married. It's a little bit more complicated than that, Ben. You see, Sarah was your mother. (During the break, Sisko makes hot drinks for them both.) Sarah and I were married for two years. She seemed very happy. I certainly was. Two days after your first birthday, she disappeared. She left me. I've asked myself that question a thousand times. I never did come up with the answer. It took me three years, but I found out. She was living in Australia working as a holo-photographer. You can't. She's dead. She died in a hovercraft accident about a month before I tracked her down. I loved that woman and she loved me. I know she did. I wanted to, many times. But you were so young when she left. I thought that might make it easier, but it didn't. I know. I'm sorry. But you see, you and your stepmother were so close. She made you laugh like nobody else, and I didn't want anything to get in the way of that. She said the same thing. Life is full of choices. You make them and hope for the best. Sometimes you're right, and sometimes you're not. I made a mistake. I still don't understand why the Prophets would send you a vision of Sarah. Well, from here on out, I hope the Prophets keep their noses out of my business. Just my gumbo recipe, but I'm taking that to my grave. [Promenade] Beautiful night, isn't it? You thinking about Sarah? I know you do. I came out to give you this. (a locket on a chain) It was Sarah's. I want you to have it. I think she would have, too. There's some kind of writing on the back. (Sisko takes it under the door light to see.) What's the matter? What does it say? I still don't understand why Sarah would have a locket with Bajoran writing on it. I don't recall her ever mentioning Bajor to me. What is it? Sounds like you've reached a dead end. But it could be anywhere. Where do you begin to look? Today's special is shrimp creole. Ah, actually, it's barbecued shrimp. (Sisko and Jake enter.) Excuse me. Where were you? They told me you were released from the hospital two hours ago. And the Bajoran that attacked you, who was he? I don't suppose I can talk you out of going to Tyree. I figure you can handle them. But if the cult knows you're looking for the Orb of the Emissary, chances are the Pah wraiths do as well. And that does worry me. [Quark's] (A Klingon ship is leaving.) I am going on vacation. To Tyree. Apparently it runs in the family. Oh, nothing I hate more than turning away a customer. (He pulls back the net curtain to reveal a petite brunette Trill Ensign.) I'm sorry, we're closed. Oh, you're in luck. (opens the door) Five more minutes and he'd have been gone. (Sisko is at the piano again.)
Sarah was your mother. Some accident. The main thing is the control panel's all cleaned up, so if one of you would like to get back into the pilot's seat, it would sure make me feel better. Not that I don't trust the computer. Do you need to lie down? Well, it's time for my nap. (Joseph leaves.) And miss all the excitement? Not a chance. (gasping) Never better. [Dominion briefing room] We started this together and we'll finish it together. I owe it to Ben. (On a steeper slope, Joseph stumbles.)
