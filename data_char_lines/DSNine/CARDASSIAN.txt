This is Cardassian navigational control post twenty four. Identify yourself. According to our scan, your subspace field emitters appear to be malfunctioning. Do you require assistance?

I said go! [Corridor] (Up on Terok Nor, the women are being assigned quarters in pair. Kira spots the pattern and changes places so she ends up with her mother.)
Combat stations. Enemy ship approaching. (It's the Defiant on Weyoun's monitor.)
Legate Damar, please report to your quarters.
We're with you!
