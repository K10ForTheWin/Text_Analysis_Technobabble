Not yet. (A Klingon pushes O'Brien against a bulkhead, another points his disrupter at Odo. Everyone say Hi! to Tim Russ, soon to be Tuvok of Voyager.) No questions. You see? The ever-helpful Federation. So predictable. The Empire is governed by doddering fools and frightened old women who aren't worthy of the name Klingon. Mareel, the comm. badge. You, shifter. Inside. Now. Or this one dies. (Yeto seals liquid Odo in the box and hands it to Mareel.) Let's go, ally. [Infirmary] That depends on you. Yeto, get the Ferengi. Any more questions? Mareel, the box. Put it in your stasis chamber. Now. Or I will destroy it. Don't bother. Now! (fires his disrupter at the ceiling) Get to the centre of the room. (to O'Brien and Bashir) Get with the others. Move. Your turn, little man. I said no one moves. You'll have to ask my employer. Get it. Enough stalling. Take them to the Infirmary. No talking! (T'Kar kicks O'Brien's shoulder. Sisko wrestles the Klingon. Kira takes on Mareel but is easily beaten. Sisko knocks down T'Kar then faces Mareel with a phaser.) Pathetic. The storm's decreased another fifteen percent. Yeto, report! The doctor? Impossible.
