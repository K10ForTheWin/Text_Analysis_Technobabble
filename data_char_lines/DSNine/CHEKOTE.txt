I think so, Commander. How's it look? Are you preparing to withdraw? Damn. That's a hell of a turn. How can these Bajorans get in bed with the Cardassians? Then you're saying it's a genuine political revolution internal to Bajor. But internal to Bajor. The Cardassians might involve themselves in other people's civil wars, but we don't. The Prime Directive applies, Ben. Would you say our people on the station are in danger? : There's no other choice but to evacuate. We'll have to worry about the long term political implications down the road. That's an order, Commander. [Ops]
