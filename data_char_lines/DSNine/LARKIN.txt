You heard him! Cease fire, damn it! (woman) Who told you to open fire? They look like Jem'Hadar to you? I gave the word to hold your fire. That Starfleet officers were beaming down with supplies. Sorry, Captain. A little breakdown in communications. He was killed ten days ago. So was Commander Parker. I am. Lieutenant Nadia Larkin. Vargas can show you. Welcome to paradise, Captain. [Bunker] (There's a two story plus piece of equipment in the big cave.) There it is. The only reason anyone gives a damn about this place. It's the largest Dominion communications array in the sector. One thing's for sure, they're determined to get it back. I know our orders, Captain. But maybe Starfleet Command isn't aware of our situation. We've been holding this place for five months. That's five months of fighting off repeated Jem'Hadar attempts to get it back. When we landed here, there was a hundred and fifty of us. We're down to forty three. Lucky us. (On the ground floor, someone is working on the array.) Damn it! [Base camp] (Someone has been killed.) A hundred times. It doesn't help, not with Houdinis. They hide in subspace and appear at random. Don't worry about us, Captain. Yes, sir. You heard the Captain. Sir, what are your orders? Well, you're not going to learn anything with a tricorder. We jam their sensors, they jam ours. That's how it works. Except they have an advantage. They know where we are. All things considered, I'd still rather be in their shoes. (Sisko runs to the other end of the line.) Here they come. (Six Jem'Hadar unshroud. They shoot them down easily. More appear and get themselves shot too.) Without risking any casualties. Smart. Get a stretcher. Let's get him to the infirmary. Right away. Let's go. This is close enough, Nog. It's time to go. (A lot of Jem'Hadar are moving out.) Let's go. (On the way back, Nog hears something. They start to retreat then Larkin gets shot in the back, Nog in the leg.) [Base camp]
