I'm not. I'm just looking at something. I was just looking at a lizard when I saw it. The Rubber Tree People? And they still use firewood instead of magnesite fuel like everyone else. Sacred land? Huh. The Sky Spirits must have taken a wrong turn somewhere. [Moon surface] Why do your Sky Spirits choose a place where it rains all the time? And it's hot, and there are so many bugs. Sorry, Sky Spirits, I will never make friends with bugs. I'm sorry I can't be what you want me to be. No one chooses for me. I choose my own way. And if that makes me a contrary, I'll have to live with it. I'm leaving the tribe, Father. I got to know a lot of the Starfleet officers patrolling the Cardassian border. I asked Captain Sulu if he would sponsor me at Starfleet Academy. I told him I had your approval. I kept him as far away from you as I could. Our tribe lives in the past. A past of fantasy and myth. Other tribes have learned to accept the twenty fourth century. Why can't ours? I know. That's why I have to leave. I ask for your blessing, Father. (Their guides call to them. They have found a wooden structure in a small clearing.) [Jungle] NEELIX Maybe we should just leave them alone. (Antonio speaks in his language. Kolopak replies, then holds up his hands and speaks to anyone that might be hiding in the jungle. Faces appear in the foliage.) Father. (Chakotay runs for the weapons, but a well aimed spear stops him. Kolopak drops his backpack, takes off his hat, kneels and clears a piece of ground. The tribal leader comes forward to watch Kolopak draw the combination of spirals and lines in the soil.) No, thank you. (The women leave him. Kolopak's transformation is complete.)
