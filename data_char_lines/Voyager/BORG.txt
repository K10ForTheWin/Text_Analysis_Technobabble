We are the Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile. Negotiation is irrelevant. You will be assimilated. Unacceptable. Our space is vast. Your passage would require too much time. We need the technology now. Species 8472 must be stopped. Our survival is your survival. Give us the technology. State your proposal. You have entered grid nine two of subjunction twelve. Proceed. We will begin. (A Borg grabs Janeway and pushes her to her knees. Another grabs Tuvok.) A neural transceiver is required for maximum communication. We will work as one mind. The neural link is temporary. You will not be damaged. Your primitive communication is inefficient. Irrelevant. You must comply. Elaborate. Species 8472 has penetrated Matrix zero one zero, grid nineteen. Eight planets destroyed. Three hundred twelve vessels disabled. Four million, six hundred twenty one Borg eliminated. We must seize control of the Alpha Quadrant vessel, and take it into the alien realm.
