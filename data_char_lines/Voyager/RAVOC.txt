Tri-lobe regression complex? Polar-affective disorder? Dysphoria syndrome. According to your work, the condition is very rare. Engrammatic resequencing is typically indicated. Resequencing is a radical procedure. No. That's what we're here to do. [Supervisor's office] Yes, sir. I've been thinking. This is the second person we've admitted with dysphoria syndrome in two days and they both work at the power plant. Maybe we should issue a health alert, examine the rest of the workers. Sir? I'm sorry to have bothered you. I'm a doctor. You can trust me. Well, you've come to the right place. Hansen, Annika. You've been a patient here before. You were treated for dysphoria syndrome. These disturbing thoughts you mentioned. Would you characterise them as hallucinations? We're conducting studies to determine that. Fortunately, we have one of the foremost experts on the condition working here. Doctor Kadan's very busy. Wait here. I'll find him. (Ravoc leaves. Seven promptly hacks into his computer.) [Jaffen's apartment] She was a voluntary patient. There was no reason for security to stop her. She accessed sixty four restricted files, all of them for people diagnosed with dysphoria syndrome. According to the records, those patients were all admitted on the same day, and you're listed as the attending physician in every case. You've never mentioned it. Everyone of them was discharged to the main Power Authority. That supervisor you were talking to, that's where he worked. That plant worker, Amal Kotay. He claimed that his friends had been abducted and put to work after having their memories altered. You're making false diagnoses. Selectively changing what people remember, and then sending them to work at the power plant. Why? We're doctors. We're not supposed to harm patients. By altering their memories? You're profiting from this, aren't you? I'll report you. Well, Criminal Investigations, then. Does everyone know about this?
