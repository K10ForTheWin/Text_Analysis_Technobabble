If you two can catch any. Come on, B'Elanna, let's go. Here. (Elizabeth takes a sandwich out of a box.) Your mom wasn't sure you'd be able to come this weekend. (The boys see some worms on the ground.) I'm glad you made it. No, I mean it. Hey, stop it. Stop. It was a stupid joke, Dean. He's always doing stuff like that to me. (B'Elanna growls and runs off.) B'Elanna, wait. [Sickbay] Uncle John? I. It. (B'Elanna comes out of the bushes.) It was our fault. Flying fish?
