Captain. Each time we do this, I feel as thought I've left a few molecules behind in your Cargo bay. They've changed the rendezvous point again. Did they send the new coordinates? Meaning?  It's unusual, but not unheard of. There have been sympathisers before. Kashyk may be telling the truth. Devore soldiers undergo years of mental training to prevent that. I've given it some thought. There's a scientist named Torat. He's from a nearby system. He's rumoured to know more about the wormhole than anyone. He might help us, for a price. His species power their ships with a fluidic alloy that's difficult to find. I have some data on it's composition. We can't determine its exact position until we reach the system, but we know it will open in roughly six hours.  We're approaching the coordinates. I'm firing the torpedo. (The wormhole opens. They fly inside and it closes again.)
