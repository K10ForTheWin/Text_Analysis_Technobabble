Did you sustain any casualties, Captain? I'm pleased to hear that. We are projecting casualties at two million, if the worst occurs. I have deployed our fleet to intercept this missile in a matter of hours. And what would you have me do? Sit here and wait for death to fall from the sky? I'm sorry. We haven't had much sleep. We weren't prepared for anything like this. We are not a war-like race. We haven't devoted our resources to building weapons like yours. Please, I've always hated that title. My name is Kellan. I prefer that. I appreciate your efforts, truly, but the decision has been made. We have some good pilots, Captain. Perhaps they will surprise you. [Transporter room] What can be done in forty one minutes? Use your ship? To collide with it? Do you really think that would work? You would sacrifice yourselves to benefit a people you didn't even know two days ago? Your reputation in this quadrant isn't deserved, Captain. For what it's worth, you've made a friend here.
