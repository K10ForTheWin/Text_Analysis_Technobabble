Go away, old man! Can't you see? These are men of commerce. They have no business with your silly poems. And may I say, gentlemen, you both have very fine shoes. Well, the Sages say you can tell a great deal about a man from his shoes, and I can tell from your shoes that you're men of refinement, affluence. Well, you're obviously new in Takar. Perhaps I could interest you in some property. What about some transportation? The Sages say, 'Time's an asset.' And you shouldn't waste your assets walking everywhere you go. You'd be wearing out those fine shoes of yours. Oh, thank the Sages I found you. You can't enter the temple without wearing your ears. You're really not Takarian, are you? Nobody visits the temple without displaying at least one ear. (They see passersby with replicas of large-lobed ears on thongs around their necks.) If you're not wearing an ear, you could be fined, even arrested. You wouldn't want that to happen. As a matter of fact, I can. (The merchant lays out his roll of wares and looks at their fine footwear.) Captain's log, supplemental. I've been asked to join Lieutenant Torres and Ensign Kim in the science lab to hear what they've termed as very exciting news. [Science lab] Gentlemen, as the Sages say, 'Your goods are now my goods'. Perhaps I could interest you in some discounted mining futures?
