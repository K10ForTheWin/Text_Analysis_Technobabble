Who are you? What do you want?  She does.  An imbalance? Is it contagious?  Not before you tell me why you came here.  Then why are you carrying weapons?  Let me see one.  (Chakotay gives Ishan his hand phaser.)  And what is that? Some sort of scanning device?  But it didn't detect any lifeforms here?  Seismic alert. That wall is unstable. Be careful.  I want to know about the vessel which brought you here. Your  propulsion systems, weapons, sensors, everything. You have an  artificial implant in your arm.  I also want to know about your medical technology, scientific  advances, artificial intelligence.  You should expect no better treatment after invading Sakari  territory.  Yes, so you've said.  If they had been fully effective, you wouldn't have found  anything interesting enough to bring you here.  What?  You've seen the ruins?  Long ago, before I wan born.  My people never even knew who the invaders were or why they  attacked. It was all over in less than an hour. Some of the colonists  were fortunate enough to escape into the mines. We've lived here ever  since, where it's safe. If the invaders ever learned of our existence  here, they might return.  Agreed. But you will be supervised at all times.   [Cave] (Another  tremor is starting.)
