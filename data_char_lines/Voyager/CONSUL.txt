The Garan Mining Colony infected. We purified them. Your distress call received. Voyager infected. We are purifying you. No choice. No cure for the virus. Voyager's existence a threat. Your illness, our apologies. A cure? A chance. One hour. (Transmission ends.) Of course, of course. Purification will cease. My word. Many thanks to Captain of Voyager. Good health. (Transmission ends, and Janeway relaxes.)
