Good health, strong body, clear mind. Please make her quiet. And you. Your journey home short and safe. Captain's log, stardate 50425.1. Mister Neelix and I have completed our three day trade mission with the Tak Tak, one of the more unusual species we've encountered in the Delta Quadrant. We are en route back to Voyager. [Shuttlecraft] The Garan Mining Colony infected. We purified them. Your distress call received. Voyager infected. We are purifying you. No choice. No cure for the virus. Voyager's existence a threat. Your illness, our apologies. A cure? A chance. One hour. (Transmission ends.) Of course, of course. Purification will cease. My word. Many thanks to Captain of Voyager. Good health. (Transmission ends, and Janeway relaxes.)
