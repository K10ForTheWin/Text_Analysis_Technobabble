This is Commander Avek of the Benthan Guard. We're taking you into custody. Prepare to surrender the vessel to us at once. We do not negotiate with thieves. Surrender the vessel peacefully or we will use force. (They tractor his ship. A massive ship arrives and they leave quickly. A woman with long elaborate ear tips beams aboard.)
