It's almost curfew. Good night, then. Let her go. (Neelix and Torres beam out. Chakotay runs) Stop!  He turned into the access way. Be careful, he might be armed. To Be Continued... He's deactivated a safety field. Alert emergency medical, he may have tried to jump. (Chakotay attacks him, and gets his weapon, but gets wounded by the other security officer before he shoots them both and escapes.) {Bridge] I have an order to transfer this patient to Division six. We believe that he's mentally ill. I'm sorry, sir, but my orders are to bring him for immediate treatment. If you check that order, you'll see it's been approved by the Director of Investigations. (Chakotay is wheeled away strapped to a gurney.) You're sure? If you do see her, report it immediately. She needs to be hospitalised. (The security men leave.) Stay where you are. (He gets sedated by Jaffen, who takes his gun and shoots at the others. Janeway and Jaffen hide behind a console.)
Right away, sir. [Bridge] (Chakotay is running the ship from the helm. He has one other bridge crew, a young woman.)
Aye, sir. [Mess hall] (Kes is sitting alone when Tanis enters.)
Security to Commander Harkins. We've been isolated by the forcefields. Can you shut down the programme?HARKINS: I'm working on it.
Step away.
Aye, sir. [Cargo bay] (Three Kazon get out of the shuttle.)
Hold it! (The chase is on.) [Another street] (Kim is rugby tackled to the ground, then the security guard takes out his phaser.) Get up!
