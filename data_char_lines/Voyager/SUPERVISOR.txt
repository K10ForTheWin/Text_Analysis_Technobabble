Your authorisation and licenses please? Level six in thermal dynamics and quantum fusion. Well, Janeway, I'm impressed. Now if you can just manage to report to your shift on time. They're always looking for skilled workers. I'm surprised they didn't offer you a job. Well, it's easy to get disoriented when you're new here.

They process more than eight thousand Let me know if there's anything you need. You'll find we like to keep our workforce happy.  The specifications you asked for.  Qualification level three in micro-kinetics. You could use some improvement there. Level five in thermionic conversion. Good, We lost a thermionic specialist yesterday. Health problems. (Chakotay looks at a female human worker.) Someone you know? We have a diverse workforce. Our thermionic converters operate on a rotating frequency, so they have to be closely monitored. You'll be required to report your readings to the controller at a regular interval. Any questions? (Chakotay has spotted Janeway.) Are you listening to me? Carry on. (The supervisor leaves. Chakotay goes over to Janeway.) Maybe it's different where you come from, but here it's polite to say good morning. Eight five eight three. The man who was removed by security yesterday. He's been hospitalised. Well, tell them not worry. What can we do for you? Who? If you'd done your job the first time, we wouldn't have a problem now.
