When we agreed to be examined by this ship's medical officer, we didn't know that you were a primitive computer matrix. Does that include bloodletting? Maybe we can disable its speech subroutines. What is the status of our ship? The problem is your technology. Interference from your antiquated scanning devices shut down our propulsion system. Our injuries will have to be treated first. Is there someone other than this hologram who could help us? What is that? No. What you were doing. Do it again. Difficult to quantify. Maybe it's a fractal. What is the purpose of this music? Is it an encryption code of some kind? Why would anyone do that? Can't they do that through speech? We? You mean to say others aboard your ship are capable of producing this phenomenon? We wish to hear the Doctor. Does the Doctor sing rock 'n' roll? As am I.
