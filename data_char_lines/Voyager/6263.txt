Unit 3947, what can you report? Our sensors indicate that the humanoid vessel will require approximately one hundred and forty hours to repair. It is necessary for you to complete work on the prototype before that time. Our tactical subprocessors indicate a seventy nine percent likelihood that rescue will be attempted when sufficient repairs are completed. At optimal efficiency your engines are more powerful than ours. We will remain on full tactical alert. The humanoid may purposefully attempt to delay completion of the prototype hoping she will be rescued. If you fail, you and your people will die. (Unit 6263 leaves.)
