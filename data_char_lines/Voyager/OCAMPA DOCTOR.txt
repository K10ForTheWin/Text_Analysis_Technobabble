I hope you're feeling better. I know how frightening all this must be for both of you. I've brought some clothes if you'd care to change. You are not prisoners. In fact, we consider you honoured guests. The Caretaker has sent you to us. As long as you are not violent, you are free to leave your quarters. We really don't know. You must be hungry. Would you care to join me on the courtyard for a meal?  [Ocampa settlement] (It's an enclosed place with glass ceiling and lots of girders. The whumph of the energy packets from the array can be heard.) Our food dispensers are right this way. Our society is subterranean. We've lived here for over five hundred generations. Until the Warming began. When our surface turned into a desert and the Caretaker came to protect us. Our ancient journals tell us he opened a deep chasm in the ground and led our ancestors to this place. Since then he has provided for all our needs. Please forgive them. They know you've come from the Caretaker. None of us has ever seen him. This way, please. (They jump the queue for a food replicator.) In fact, he does. He designed and built this entire city for us after the Warming. The food processors dispense nutritional supplements every four point one intervals. It may not offer the exotic tastes some of our younger people crave these days, but it meets our needs. He never communicates directly. We try to interpret his wishes as best we can. We believe he must have separated you from your own species for their protection. From your illness. Perhaps he's trying to prevent a plague. From time to time, he asks us to care for people with this disease. It's the least we can do. Yes. Your condition is serious. We don't know exactly how to treat it. I'm afraid the others did not recover.  [Neelix's quarters] Large jugs of water have been arranged as a table centre piece and a banquet is laid out, half devoured. Steam is coming from the bathroom together with sounds that might be meant to be musical.)
