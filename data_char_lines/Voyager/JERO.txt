I've trimmed the sails but the sea is rough. Maybe we should return. We die together. Finally! Seven of Nine, did you find B'Elanna Torres? Unpleasant news delivered by the most pleasing of messengers. (Jero sits up to kiss Layna.) Seven of Nine, did you find B'Elanna Torres?  When a friend is lost, the mind is split in half, Divided between memory of the past and fear of the future. Harry Kim, Ensign. Only a boy when fate took you from the arms of blue green Earth. B'Elanna Torres, half Klingon, half Human. I am honoured to call you Yes. Everybody cries. I can't believe that. The audience won't believe it either. They'll either think Tuvok is an unfeeling monster, or that I am a bad performer. Captain? The last Tuvok scene doesn't make sense to me, and we still don't have an ending.  Our patron has arrived. He's not in a very good mood.  This final scene will ruin everything that we've done out there. We'll have to improvise.
