Jal Razik, First Maje of the Kazon-Ogla. I will speak to your captain. You are trespassing in Ogla space. Why do you orbit our moon? That is a lie. You are here looking for your Commander Chakotay. Quite simply. We killed him. He kidnapped a young man. During his escape, it became necessary to destroy his ship. No doubt you found the remains, so I suggest you depart immediately. Don't tempt me, Talaxian. I would just as soon open fire. If you've detected the extensive weaponry deployed on the moon, know this. With one remote command, I can cause that weaponry to self-destruct, destroying the surface of the moon and everyone on it.
