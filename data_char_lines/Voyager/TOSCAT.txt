I didn't meant to be rude but you should not be here. That won't be possible. We cannot interfere with the Caretaker's wishes. You don't understand. The stories of our ancestor's cognitive abilities are apocryphal. At the very least exaggerated. We should not dwell on what's been lost but on all that's been gained. You defied the Caretaker by going to the surface, Kes. Learn from the experience. Follow the path he has set for us.
