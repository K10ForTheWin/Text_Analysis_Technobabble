Can we go now? I want to go. He said it was a shuttle, not a ship. What's electro-turbulence? I'm hungry. What's rations? I want takka berries. That's when the Morrok comes. It lives here in the cave. (Tuvok gets out his tricorder.) It took the others. Jarren and Fayla, the other children on the ship! By the big tree, when we went to sleep last night. Jarrin hurt his hand. Uh huh. Please can we go? But the Morrok! I can't help it. I'm scared. It's like this big, black cloud with lots of thunder and lightning all around us. Even when your shuttle crashed? But what if there was this big hairy tardeth coming after you? Let me have it! But I want to sit next to you. (Corin looks at the back of Tuvok's head.) Tuvok? Why do your ears look like that? Why? What are you doing? Tuvok? Do you have any children? But I want to know! What are they like? Tuvok? I have to scratch my nose. Is it a ship? We have to go! What are you doing? They bring children here for the final ritual. Then the Morrok takes them away. Is it true? Is that what really happens? Aren't you going to sleep? Maybe the Morrok doesn't show up on the scanners. Okay. (All three come up to Tuvok.) I'd like to hear a story. Tell us one about the fire beast of Sullus. Don't Vulcan's tell bedtime stories? What's that?
