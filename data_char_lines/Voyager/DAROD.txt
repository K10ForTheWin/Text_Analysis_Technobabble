I haven't seen any woman. Yes.  You'd be welcome to use our transmitter if we still had one. The Mokra confiscated it this morning. He stayed inside with me then got transported up to your ship. Don't you think there are people in there I'd like to get out? Any sane person would tell you it's impossible. I've heard about you, old man. You're the coward. What are you doing with this lunatic? Has he been telling you stories of his brave deeds? They're just fantasies. Taking him along on this rescue mission of yours is just suicide. All right, stay with him. Go up to the prison. Get yourself killed. There are access tunnels on the north side. They'll get you in a little closer, but they're guarded. They're not free. That's worth some weapons. I can have someone meet you on the street in three hours to make the trade. He'll be wearing a blue vest. Watch for him. I'd wish you luck, but what you'll need is a miracle. (Later.) Back this way. I'll show you. (Further on, they hear footsteps.) Guards! No one will forget what he did here today. I'll make sure of that. [Bridge]
