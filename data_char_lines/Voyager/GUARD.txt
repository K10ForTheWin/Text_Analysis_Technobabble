Hey, calm down. It's all right. Now, what's the problem? Shh. Now, calm down. You've been reading too many of those Dark Storm tales, young fellow. There's no such thing as demons. Ah, ah, ah! Run along now. Have a confection bar and calm down. All right everybody, back to your business. Nothing else to see here now. (The young boy leaves and the crowd disperses.) Oh, sorry about that. Who knows what gets into their heads, huh? Come in on the continental transport? Is, er, that what they're wearing in Kalto province these days? There's one right over there. I hope the rest of your stay with us is more enjoyable. (The guard leaves them.) Is there something I can do for you?
You. Come with me. You asked to contact your ship. The Prefect wishes to discuss your request. Stop! Quickly, now. In there! What's going on here? If she's too weak, I'll take her back to the barracks. What are you doing? Come with us. You! Why are you talking to that prisoner. Why wasn't I notified? I've never seen you before. Very well, take him. But from now on I expect to be notified in advance of all transfers.
Get up. (Tuvok and Torres are arrested. A guard takes Janeway's comm. badge then a little man comes running up.) You girls aren't supposed to come down here any more. I didn't say that. If my Lieutenant saw you here I'd be in trouble.
You're coming with us. Hurry up. Go.
Have your identification ready. All the way out. Let's move. (The gates close behind Dathan.) [Corridor] (Kes finds Torres passed out in the corridor.) Sanric. Farran. (The young woman speaks to Korenna.) Move along Lishan. Alaris. Dathan Alaris! (Korenna goes to the gate.)
Autarch!
Excuse me, sir.
