Have your identification ready. All the way out. Let's move. (The gates close behind Dathan.) [Corridor] (Kes finds Torres passed out in the corridor.)  Demelos! Sanric. Farran. (The young woman speaks to Korenna.) Move along Lishan. Alaris. Dathan Alaris! (Korenna goes to the gate.)
Excuse me, sir.
Autarch!
Their ship's returned. One of the patrols took another prisoner. No, sir. (He points his weapon at Verin.)
 Was es ist, Fr√§ulein? Kommen hier. (He helps her go inside.) [Kapitan's office] (The Kapitan is a human, and an SS officer.)
You. Come with me. You asked to contact your ship. The Prefect wishes to discuss your request. Stop! Quickly, now. In there! What's going on here? If she's too weak, I'll take her back to the barracks. What are you doing? Come with us. You! Why are you talking to that prisoner. Why wasn't I notified? I've never seen you before. Very well, take him. But from now on I expect to be notified in advance of all transfers.
You're coming with us. Hurry up. Go.
Get up. (Tuvok and Torres are arrested. A guard takes Janeway's comm. badge then a little man comes running up.) Check this one here. (The guard hammers on the door.) Open up there! Open the door, open the door now! Break it down! (Janeway and Caylem escape through a hole in the wall. The guards break in.) [Market place] (Janeway taps gently on the shop door.) Get down there. (Darod is marched past at gunpoint.) [Tunnels]  Three more hours. There's nothing going on around here. Wake me if the Lieutenant shows up, will you? (Janeway approaches, skirt split to the thigh and hair loose.) You girls aren't supposed to come down here any more. I didn't say that. If my Lieutenant saw you here I'd be in trouble.
Hey, calm down. It's all right. Now, what's the problem? Shh. Now, calm down. You've been reading too many of those Dark Storm tales, young fellow. There's no such thing as demons. Ah, ah, ah! Run along now. Have a confection bar and calm down. All right everybody, back to your business. Nothing else to see here now. (The young boy leaves and the crowd disperses.) Oh, sorry about that. Who knows what gets into their heads, huh? Come in on the continental transport? Is, er, that what they're wearing in Kalto province these days? There's one right over there. I hope the rest of your stay with us is more enjoyable. (The guard leaves them.) Is there something I can do for you?
