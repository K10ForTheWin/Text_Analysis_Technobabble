Good day, gentlemen, good day. Anything in particular you're looking for? Anything I can help you with? Spindle bearing, spindle bearings. No, can't help you with that. No. Long voyage ahead? I might have something that could ease your journey. Ease it considerably. Rhuludian crystals. Ingesting just one of these will make days of tedious travel seem like moments of exquisite rapture. The price is surprisingly Wix. You have the supplies? Completely. Yes. I have it right here. (Sutok steps behind some containers then shoots at them. Wixiban returns fire and hits Sutok.)
