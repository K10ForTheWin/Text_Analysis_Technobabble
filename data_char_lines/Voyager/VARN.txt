Is this a typical Federation vessel? Most of your technology is outdated. Is this a typical Federation vessel? It is my home. So if my ship joins your Federation, Voyager will help me fight my enemies? My enemies have sophisticated weaponry. What will I have to do to join? And you would use that influence on my behalf? I'll have to discuss this with my shipmates. If we were to apply now, could you assure us we'd be accepted? I'll do whatever is necessary. And in the middle of the battle, the Polonians warned me to cease hostilities or face destruction at the hands of your Federation. You allowed my enemies to join. Your Federation is a fraud. I demand reparations. Enough! If you will not reimburse me, I'll seize your ship. (Varn's bigger ship grabs Dala's in a tractor beam.) Tell them to stand down. Stand down, Voyager. I paid for my Federation membership. The Delta Flyer belongs to me now. Yes. I have. (Varn shoots at Voyager.)
