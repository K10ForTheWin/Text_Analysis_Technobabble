Welcome to Earth. I am Admiral Bullock, and I will be your Commanding Officer for the next six months. Questions, comments, bring them to me. Problems, talk to Lieutenant Kinis.(a Vulcan.) Larsen, you're assigned to the Federation Council, Deputy Liaison Officer. Young and Raskin, report to Orbital Flight Control. You'll be monitoring incoming vessels from the Bolian sector. (Someone is watching and taking photographs of the people. It is Chakotay, with the EMH's holo-camera. A short time later, he is scanning a stand of bamboo. The gardener walks up to him) Sir, a starship is approaching. It's Voyager. High-minded ideals are one thing, but your actions tell a very different story. You infiltrated our re-creation, captured and killed one of our people. You created biological weapons to infect our species. You are allies with the Borg. The Borg are irrelevant. It's the humans that pose a threat. Immaterial. Any information regarding our species has no doubt been classified by Starfleet intelligence. It's a trick. We were only trying to defend ourselves. Don't answer her. She's manipulating us. Commander. Enough! We must not negotiate with these creatures. Sir. You've been seduced by them, both of you. We can't risk trusting them. Welcome to Terrasphere Eight, Starfleet Command re-creation. I am Admiral Bullock and I'll be acquainting you with our facility. Questions, comments bring them to me. Problems talk to Lieutenant Kinis. Commander Tuvok, you wanted to examine our thermionic generators. I'll take you there personally. Ambassador Nelix? Neelix. You'll be joining the Lieutenant. He'll familiarise you with our environmental control technology.
