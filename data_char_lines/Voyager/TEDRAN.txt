I appreciate your hospitality. Are all your guests treated so well? State your demands. I understand what the Vaskans want. More of our territory, more resources. But what do you want, Captain? Why are you doing this to us? To reach your home, you would destroy ours? No, I would not. No. (Pseudo Janeway takes a phaser rifle and shoots the woman in the back.)TEDRAN: We will prevail. (She kills Tedran, too.)  Take as much of their technology as you can. Back away.(Tuvok does so. Tedran and his team leave with Seven and a crewman.) [Pseudo Bridge] pTUVOK I know what you're doing. An alliance with these aliens. You expect me to believe that? You plan to use this ship to destroy us.
