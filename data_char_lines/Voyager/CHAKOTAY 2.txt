Captain? Aye, Captain. [Voyager 2 - Sickbay] We analysed the sensor logs from our trip through the plasma cloud. We couldn't find anything unusual until we ran a quantum level analysis. Remember that subspace turbulence we hit just before we left the cloud? Well, watch what happens. (Voyager's outline blurs.) If the same forces were at work inside the plasma cloud, they may have duplicated every particle of matter on Voyager. So what do we do? They've got everything below deck five, and I don't know how much longer we can keep them away from the Bridge. We're outnumbered two to one.
