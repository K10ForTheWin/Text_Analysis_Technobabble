Aye, Captain.
Sorry.

Aye, Commander.
Bridge to Mister Neelix. You have an incoming transmission. Yes, sir. [Neelix's quarters] LAXETH
Oh, God. Stop it. [Corridor] Neelix, over here! (Something rushes along the tunnel to the cave entrance. Hogan screams. When Neelix and others get there, he is gone.)

Captain Janeway. I'm receiving a transmission from Lieutenant Tuvok, audio only. Acknowledged.
Transporter room two is secure.
