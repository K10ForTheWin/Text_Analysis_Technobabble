Sir.
Yes, Captain.
Thank you.
Oh, God. Stop it. [Corridor] Neelix, over here! (Something rushes along the tunnel to the cave entrance. Hogan screams. When Neelix and others get there, he is gone.)
Sorry.
Be my guest. (Tuvok takes it off him at the door.) [Deck 13 corridor] What is this?
Setting coordinates. Aye, sir. [Delta Flyer]
Aye, Commander.
Yes, Lieutenant. Yes, sir. [Bridge] (The transwarp hub is going KaBOOM. The Sphere is firing at Voyager.)
Yes, sir.
 Here you are, Lieutenant. Â (Torres takes the PADD.)
Did you see that? [Briefing room]
Yes, ma'am. (Braxton beams in. A Kazon weapons hit to Voyager makes him stagger. His foot catches the crewman's elbow and he falls to his knees.)
I'm here for my physical.
