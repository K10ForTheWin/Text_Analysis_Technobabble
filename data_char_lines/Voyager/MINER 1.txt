They're going to be here any moment. I want to make a good impression. Orek will be pleased that we took the initiative. Welcome to Telsius. I'm not familiar with Earth. You're a long way from home. Yes. We've had a shortage of dilithium for the last two months. If we can't replenish our supply we may be forced to suspend work. Yes, but we are authorised to conduct trades in his absence. I'm afraid the only commodity we have is, er, bolomite. Orphans? We only have ten kilotons left. Give us an hour to finalise the arrangements. The bolomite is ready for transport. We thank you for your generosity. Er, Captain,Â we haven't received the dilithium yet. Captain, we haven't received the dilithium yet
