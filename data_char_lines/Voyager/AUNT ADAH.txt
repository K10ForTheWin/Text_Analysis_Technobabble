Come up here. Come on, now. I have a pitcher of lemonade and some sugar cookies. (Every crew person has a tricorder.) Oh, you poor things. You must be tired out. Come on and sit down and rest awhile. Have a cold drink, hmm? Now, just make yourselves right at home. The neighbours should be here any minute. Oh! Why, here they are! (A group of people arrive.) Now we can get started. You're all invited to the welcoming bee! Have some nice fresh corn on the cob. Fresh corn on the cob. Corn on the cob. Corn on the cob. Oh, we don't mean you any harm. I'm sorry if we put you out. Why don't you just put your feet up and get comfortable while you wait? Isn't anybody hungry? Come on now, make yourselves at home. I'm sorry if we put you out. (Kim and Paris walk around the house. A dog follows them.) Very well. Since no one seems to care for any corn, we'll have to proceed ahead of schedule. (The barn wall disappears to reveal a high-tech room that goes on into the distance. Chakotay, B'Elanna and Tuvok are lying on narrow ledges with a long needles sticking into their abdomens. Just as the farmers and Voyager crew vanish we see that all the Maquis are there. The next shot is of Janeway having her stomach skewered and her passing out. Paris is next to her and across the aisle Kim screams.  [Engineering] (The crew wake up.)
