You're home now, Harry. Spiced hatana. I prepared it myself. Harry, try some. And a third. We'll all be joined with Taymon tonight. What do humans call it when a man and women are joined? How unusual. I hope you come to our ceremony. The joining is complete. (His wives lead Taymon away. The lights come on.) It would have been much easier for you if you hadn't seen this. We must nucleate a large number of cells to collect enough genetic material for conception. Any father should be willing to sacrifice himself for the sake of his children, for the continuation of his race. It's true male children are very rare here, and that we seek out new DNA to sustain our race. We need males of other species, like you, who can be transformed into compatible mates. You'll be celebrated for your contribution. This won't work. You're too important to us. Whatever happens to me, they won't allow you to leave. (Kim pushes Malia into the other two, then runs out.)
