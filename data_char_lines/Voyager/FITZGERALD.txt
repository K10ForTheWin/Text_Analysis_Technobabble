Oh, leave it alone, Seamus. Can't one day go by without you making an ass of yourself? No, this is the first. Oh, go on. Are you suggesting that Fair Haven's going to go the way of Killmannin, just because we have a few new folks in town? You're not the only one. At first I thought we had an epidemic on our hands, but this is no fever. They took you? Where? What did they want with you? Oh, Lord. What does that mean? How did you get away? I wonder if this is how things started in Killmannin back in '46. Under normal circumstances, I'd agree with you, Michael, but these aren't normal circumstances. We don't know what the spirit folk have in store for us. What are you doing?
