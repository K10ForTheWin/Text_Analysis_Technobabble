Hi She doesn't look like a corporate hit man. This ship will never sink. Right, Dad? I'm Jason, by the way. The Millennium Gate. The world's first self-sustaining civic environment. Believe me, you don't want to be licking stamps for the next two days. Yeah, but my dad doesn't believe in computers. We don't even have one. Dad? Easy for you to say. I have to go to school with their kids. They said they'd build a new one, a better one. I didn't think you'd mind. You've got some really great games on this. Oh, yeah. I got vaporised on level six. Cool. Coffee? Bloomington. All the suppliers in town are boycotting us, so he went up there to place some orders. Alexandria Books, may I help you? I pay the bills too. Dad's not very good at accounting. You have any kids? Not a priority? She died. I was really young. I don't remember her much. Dad says none of the great heroes grew up in a nuclear family. Hercules, Achilles, Odysseus. They all grew up with single parents. It's okay. I don't know. The Millennium Gate could be pretty cool. They showed it in science class one time. Must have been great. We are not living in a heroic age, that's what my dad says. Dad. I mean, he's a pain sometimes, but he's pretty cool. (phone rings) Alexandria Books, may I help you? That's all right. First call Hey, Dad you're famous. (A picture of his confrontation with Moss is on the newspaper front page.) No one here but us galliforms. What's going on? But I thought you were staying here for a while. Aunt Pat's. Happy New Year. [Street] Shannon! It's Dad. He won't leave the shop. There's all these people outside. The police are there. Please, won't you talk to him? He'll listen to you. Where are you going? And what's this about I'll see you in Ohio? What's wrong with this place? I thought you liked us. Then why are you leaving?
