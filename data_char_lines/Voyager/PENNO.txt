 By your coverings, you're a novice, defender. Do I tell the truth? Which contingent? Tell us, did you and your allies drive the nemesis from the trunks? Marna tells the truth, Chakotay. You are welcome among my neighbours. We have no means to signal your people. The restock unit. It's not very near. At least ten thousand footfalls through the thick of the trunks. Yes, please, Chakotay. Rest until the new light. Come, neighbours. Let's give defender Chakotay some quiet. (They leave Chakotay to lie by the fire.) Thank you. Walk well, defender Chakotay. Karya! Be sturdy, my daughter's daughter. We'll glimpse each other again in the Wayafter. No! Karya! A defender. Mark, neighbours, a defender! Defender. Karya. (Karya runs up with her garland.)
