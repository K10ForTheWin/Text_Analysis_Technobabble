Well, that shouldn't be difficult. We're all friends here. (A very short woman bumps into Kim's legs as she pirouettes.) Why talk when we can dance? (Torres and Kim are bustled towards a dais with a pink guillotine, an executioner and the little dancer. The executioner tests the blade by chopping a piece of wood in half.) Let him go. Only a matter of time, yes. I do. I know. Bring them here. Bring them here, bring them here, bring them here. You're like me, a little of this and a little of that. (He produces a bunch of fake flowers for Torres. She throws them on the floor.) Oh my, what a temper. That's from your mother's side, isn't it? Yes, you see, I know everything. This is my world, my festival. And you're here without an invitation. You will talk to me! I speak for them, and I speak for you now. You don't understand that yet. You don't accept it, but you will. A virus, a virus. He thinks I am a virus. A virus, a virus. Well, perhaps, I'll be a virus today. (sneeze) Oh, this one's got a mind full of technical and operational thoughts and ideas. Harry knows viruses. I know you came here to get them and take them away. But if you do that, we'll all disappear. Ah. See the technical mind at work. It seeks diagnostics, data analysis. Well, here's some more data for your mind to analyse and diagnose, Harry. Yes, I am merely what has been created and is being created by his brain, his brain, her brain and now yours and yours. (A giant comm. badge appears on the Clown's grey outfit. Then a monitor appears on a wall.) What? What's this doing here now? This is your work! If you leave, one of them will die. One of them will die. Try it and see. If you leave, he dies. I cut off their heads. Of course it's real. As real as a nightmare. Heart attack. Now, what might cause a heart attack? Hmm. Unmanageable stress, perhaps? Unmanageable fear? The fear of losing a head, perhaps? Very wise of you, my technically minded fellow. Now, get rid of it completely. It's an intrusion. It's ruining the party. No mistake. A mistake if you refuse. Trying to get the better of me? Trying to trick me? I know everything you know, Harry Kim. I know how much you miss Libby. I know how you can never hit that G sharp in the Mozart concerto. Do you think I don't know you're trying to defeat me? Would I? I have only one demand. To exist! Well, I've come to a decision with the help of my friends. You, leave. You, stay. And tell your beloved Captain Janeway that if we die, they die, including you, dear Harry. You, who becomes my best friend as of today. Because she would never kill you, would she, Harry? No. She's like a dear old mother to you, isn't she? Go! (Torres goes to the monitor.) [Cargo Bay 1] Thinking about escape, are we, Harry? Naughty, naughty. I don't like those thoughts. We're going to have to do something about them. He can! You don't think about it anymore. Oh, but he's new, and you're old. New and old. Old and new. Well, then, the answer is to simply make you old, Harry. (And Kim is now a wrinkled, grey-haired old man.) Are you afraid of growing old, Harry? Is that what you fear? Being cared for by nurses? You don't like being helpless, do you, Harry? You like to take care of yourself. Yes, I know how you hate to feel like the baby on the crew. (Kim is a crying baby in a Starfleet uniform. The Clown picks him up.) Oh, what's the matter, Harry? Oh, does my costume frighten you, huh? Kootchy-coo. Yeah. Oh, look at little Harry fly. Whoo! Whoo! There he goes. Whoo! Whee! All right, that's enough. (He puts the baby down and Kim is back to normal.) When your only reality is an illusion, then illusion is a reality. Oh, I thought we were going to be friends. Didn't want to do this, Harry. No, I didn't want to bring this up in front of the others, but I know what really scares you. I know when you were nine, your parents took you to that colony, the radiation disaster, humanitarian mission. You visited a hospital. You remember. You wandered off by yourself where you weren't supposed to be. (Acrobats fasten Kim onto a gurney.) You saw people and things you weren't supposed to see. Sick and dying. Keep repeating. The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. And how about There's no place like home. There's no place like home. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Try clicking your heels together three times. Oh, but your legs are restrained, aren't they? Just like that little girl you saw on the operating table. (The Clown is now a surgeon.) The doctor called for a scalpel. She looked at you, her face filled with fear. Fear. Fear. Fear. Do you remember? Who are you? You're different. I don't know anything about you. You're not on the system. How am I supposed to negotiate if I don't know what you're thinking? Release the hostages? Simulated brain? Simulated? It won't work. It's a lie. Tell him, Harry. Liar! Viorsa, get over here! Tell him. Liar! After all this time, do you think I can't tell when you lie? Would leave me at your mercy. No! They stay. Who is she to tell me what I have to do? She would never kill Harry. I won't let them go. No. And if that one gets sick and dies? No, I need them all. Now go away, and tell your Captain Janeway I'm disappointed. I expected more from her. Go away. Go away. I want to be alone. I can't help it. I'm feeling sorry for myself. You people. You wonderful people. My friends. You do know how to make a man feel better, don't you? Okay, then, what shall we play? Ah, the insect game. You again? You're the one who ruined my mood. You and your sweet captain. No simulated brains. I want real brains. I already have a cloaking device. Thank you anyway. (The Clown wears a cloak.) Harry, is this possible? I don't know if I believe you. I don't know yet, but I'll know soon if you're telling the truth. You can't fool me. What does she want in return? And don't say the hostages because I'm not giving them up. (In the background items start to disappear.) She's such a warm and noble person. I'd love her to come to one of my parties someday. What if I promise to take really good care of my guests? We could be more than friends. We could be colleagues. I'm really not such a bad fellow. You tricked me! It's an attack! It's an attack! Red alert! Red alert! You! You warned them! You told them how it could be done. Take him! (The characters grab Viorsa.) You're next! You're next! [Cargo Bay 1]  We've won. We've won. We've won. Start the music. Start the music. Celebration! Celebration! Celebration!  [Sickbay]  You understand, don't you, Harry, that we will have to punish you for your captain's little trick? To the winner go the spoils, and you are the spoils, after all. We can talk about that later. For now, enjoy yourself. (The EMH appears, and the music and conga line stops dead.) Well, you certainly know how to bring a party to a halt. I bet. Ultimatum? Ultimatum? She would give me an ultimatum? Did Napoleon give an ultimatum after Waterloo? Did Chulak of Romulus give an ultimatum after his defeat at Galorndon Core? We won! We give the ultimatums around here. And scramble the brains of all my guests, including Harry? I don't think so. What are her terms? One? Never! I won't agree! I need more time. Time to think. Two! Let me keep two. She would choose to be with me? Yes. [Cargo Bay 1] EMH Sparkling. I want everything sparkling for her arrival. Sparkling. (Kim goes to the recall screen.) Ah, ah, ah, ah, Harry, not so fast. They can't have you until I have her. No more tricks. (Janeway lies in a pod and Kes puts a blinkie on her forehead.) Oh. Oh, she's coming. I can feel the system beginning to scan her brain. This really is such an extraordinary gesture she's making. I am so moved. You don't quite believe it yourself, do you? Sacrifice herself? You can be so cruel, Harry. You don't appreciate my hospitality. (Janeway appears. All the characters have disappeared.) You're here. You're actually here. I don't believe it. You show remarkable trust, Captain. How could you be so sure I would keep my word? Finally, someone who appreciates me. Am I blushing? Yes, yes, of course. You may depart. Farewell, my friends. Do come back and visit. I'll always be here. [Cargo Bay 1] (The Kohl woman takes a deep breath.) I can't wait to get to know you, to make you a part of me. An eternity of anticipation. And then the fun begins. [Cargo Bay 1] Fear is the most honest of all emotions, Captain. Now, now, don't even think about leaving. I'm not going to let you go, not after all this. Mirror? Don't we make a beautiful couple, Captain? Could have fooled me. Pardon? But, but, I, I feel you. You, You're on the system. She tricked me. No. She lied. That was very un-Starfleet of her. What will become of us? Of me? I'm afraid.
