Good morning. I have a meeting at eleven hundred hours with the head of Starfleet Security. She doesn't like to be kept waiting. Let's get this underway. Lieutenant Lasca? Yes, Lieutenant. I've looked over your specifications. It's an interesting design. But how do you propose to address the dilithium fracture problem? Tetryon plasma tends to disrupt subspace. Is there a problem, Ensign? Ensign, are you ill? Well, unfortunately, Ensign, I'm leaving for a three week tour of the Cardassian border in a few days. It will have to wait until after then. (The Admiral and senior officers leave.)  You claim to have Voyager security protocols because you were an officer on Voyager. Lost in the Delta Quadrant. And Ensign Daniel Byrd. You say that he's taken your place on that ship? And this is all because reality has been changed somehow? But you don't have a single shred of evidence to back up your claims. (An aide brings the Admiral a PADD.) Mister Kim, why did you travel to Marseilles, France this morning? You have poor taste in friends. Thomas Paris is a convicted traitor and a Maquis sympathiser. Now, what did you talk about with him? His help to run a shuttle simulation. Why? We're here to find the truth, Ensign, whatever that might be. You have that right. We will be monitoring your movements until further notice. I believe you know the restrictions. No off-world travel, and if you tamper with the anklet, Security will be immediately alerted and you will be formally charged. Do you understand? We'll be spending a lot of time together, Ensign. And I assure you, we will get to the bottom of this. You're dismissed. [Outside Cosimo's Coffee Shop]
