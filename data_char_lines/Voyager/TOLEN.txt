Now I understand. No right? This is my home. You come into my home and steal my wife, and I have no right? We'll see what your captain has to say about this. When I'm finished with you, you'll never wear that uniform again. So, from the other side of the galaxy. That's a long trip home with a damaged collimator. We have to stay one step ahead of our neighbours the Numiri. Did you bring your ship's specifications with you? Splendid. Why don't we begin to look it over at my home this evening? My wife would be delighted to have company for supper. Come on now, Neeka, stop that racket. They're friends. That's better. That's better. What a good doggy. What a good doggy. Oh, dearest, are you dressed? We have guests. I should have called. I just don't think of the common courtesies. She's really wonderful about, er, tolerating my dreadful manners. Yes, dear. I apologise. Oh, Lidell, this is Ensign Harry Kim and Lieutenant Tom Paris. They're from the other side of the galaxy. You're absolutely right. Do you have enough to feed us all, or shall we go out? Wonderful. Gentlemen, make yourselves at home. I'm going to put on my slippers. Lidell will take good care of you. (Tolen leaves the room.) Nothing too fancy or exotic around here. We're very simple folks. We enjoy an occasional guest. I think Lidell would prefer us to entertain more often than we do, yes? She's far more social than I am. I'm afraid she gets a little bored here sometimes. I'm so consumed with my work. I'm afraid she's right. We are at war, after all. By the way, how did you get past the Numiri patrols? Well done! Finished already? (Lidell leaves the table and puts her dish on the floor.) Well, we do have a lot of work to get done. Perhaps we should begin. Now I understand. No right? This is my home. You come into my home and steal my wife, and I have no right? We'll see what your captain has to say about this. When I'm finished with you, you'll never wear that uniform again.
