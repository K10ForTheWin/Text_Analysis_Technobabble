You seem like a lovely young woman. But you were the most stubborn six-year-old I've ever met. Your parents left you with me for a weekend, and you were so angry you locked yourself in my guest room and refused to come out. Oh, I coaxed you out eventually with a strawberry tart. You couldn't get enough of them. Of course, you didn't hesitate to point out if they weren't perfectly ripe. No, I'm very glad you did. It's wonderful to see you again, Annika.
