I hope we're not imposing. For us, too. This is a fine ship, Captain. I think we can arrange something. What are you offering in exchange? I'll speak to my supply officer. Dilithium? We can get that for you, too. I'm under orders to escort you out of Annari space immediately. You've been supporting our enemy. A shuttlecraft matching your hull composition fired on one of our ships several days ago, and we recently detected two human bio-signatures on a Kraylor warship. If you don't leave immediately, we'll be forced to fire on you. Then we'll escort you at impulse. You have five minutes to lift off.
