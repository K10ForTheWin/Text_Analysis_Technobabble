Invaders from the Fifth Dimension. Invaders from the Fifth Dimension A portal. Invaders from the Fifth Dimension. The Fifth Dimension. Intruder! Invaders! Citizen of the Fifth Dimension, you will be destroyed. You (The alien shoots the Robot, who flails around and disarms him. The alien flees.) Damage. Damage. Require maintenance. Help. Help. Help.
