This isn't a musical instrument. It's an atmospheric sensor. The frequency of the chimes indicates changes in weather conditions. That's exactly right. Are you a scientist? I'd be happy to. First, you have to initialise the sub-harmonic mode. (She switches on the hand device and Kim moves it around the struts and wires of the weather station. Janeway selects a blue patterned fabric.) That's a very noble story. Stories can be whimsical, or frightening, or melancholy, or many other things. But noble stories are the ones that can most affect our lives. May I have your permission to tell others this story? : But stories are an essential part of every person's being. I would never share one without permission. You do? Come with me. I know a private place where you can tell me all your stories. (Eudana takes Kim to a raised circular dais, which is lit from below.) Stand close to me. Alastria. (Eudana and Kim beam out.) [Alastria] The woods of Alastria, my favourite place. I usually come here when I want to spend time alone but, tonight it seemed right to bring you. Now, tell me your stories. All of them. The dawn zephyr. The erosene winds, passion winds, come just before the dawn. The erosene creates euphoria. Because this is a binary system. But Alastria has two. I told you. Alastria. A system far from Sikaris. Do you have to ask all these questions? Alastria is about two and a half billion times the distance between Sikaris and it's sun. Now, feel the breeze. It's still night on Sikaris. We have plenty of time. You'll see in a minute. We're here. Jaret is right. I know how much it means to you to get home. Please, listen to him.
