You're mistaken. This is more than a dream. It's my reality. And you're no different than the others. The waking species. For centuries, you've come and found us in a state that you call sleep and tried to destroy us. But not anymore. Now we are in control. One by one, you will fall asleep and enter our reality, where it is you who will be destroyed. As long as you're asleep, you're no threat to us. Leave our space. Once you're beyond it, your people will awaken. There's a six planet system less than a parsec away. It marks the nearest border of our space. Then wake yourself, and pray you never dream of us again.(Chakotay taps the back of his hand three times.) [Sickbay] Captain. Ensign Kim. Commander Chakotay. I'm glad to see you all up and about. I think you'll find that impossible. It appears you're learning more about my people after all. Prepare to surrender your ship. I won't need to. (A troop of aliens appear on the bridge. Tuvok's phaser does not work.) It's no use. We've taken every deck. The ship is ours. [Cargo Bay two] Stop, stop. Your weapons are useless against us. You're confused. Shoot them. (The first two aliens fire. No effect.) You sound very sure of yourself, Captain. Have you thought about what's happening to your bodies in the waking world? How long do you think they'll survive without nourishment, without physical activity? Your bodies are withering away as we speak. You can't stop it. Who's going to help you now, Captain? If you are there, you'll be killed, too. I think you're lying.
