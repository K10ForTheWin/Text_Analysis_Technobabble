No visual change either. Send it again. You're tired. The prime numbers and the elemental constants, then we'll stop. Do you doubt that? So you weren't one of those children that had the entire series of Sky Ship Friends? Not in our home. My grandfather wouldn't allow it. He told us that the Sky Ship was a palace where an Evil Protector lived. He said that bad children were sent there to be punished. At this point, I'd be happy to see anything, evil or not. Can you boost the signal? Any beings capable of building that Sky Ship could have destroyed our world long ago. They're not causing the tremors on purpose. If you truly believe that, why did you join this project? So do I. How could they possibly speak our language? What, what should I say? Good friends in the Sky Ship. I call you that, hoping, at least, you're not enemies. [Briefing room] ASTRONOMER
