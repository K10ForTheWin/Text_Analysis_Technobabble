I suppose tests make sense to her. You're welcome to wait with us. Oh, she's just determined. She wants to get on with it. Oh no, she knows what she wants to do. She's not the kind to sit around when she has a mission to accomplish. (Janeway tries to open the door at the other end of the room.) Oh, don't feel bad. You wouldn't believe some of the things people have done to themselves on their way to seek the spirits. Real is such a relative term.

Take Kes back into the shrine and trust the spirits to return her soul. If you believe you're ready, then you are. There's no more to it than that.
