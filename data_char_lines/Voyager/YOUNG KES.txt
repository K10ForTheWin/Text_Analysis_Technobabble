Who are you? What is this place? You're my father. Listen to me, something terrible's been happening to me. There might not be much time so I've got to explain this quickly. Please try to believe me. I've been living aboard a starship called Voyager. Listen to me. I did go to the surface, or rather, I will go there, and the people aboard the ship are going to rescue me from the Kazon and take me with them. No, there's no time. You've got to believe me. One moment I was this old woman and then, and then Father, please. [Ocampa Medical Centre]
