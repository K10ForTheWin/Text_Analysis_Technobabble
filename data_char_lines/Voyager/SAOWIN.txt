Could you tell me where to find Mister Kurros? (A sleek machine beeps at him.)SAOWIN: Wait! (The place shudders slightly as a giant water-dweller moves in his tank beyond the wall. A small humanoid in a long gown speaks gently.) Thank you. No. You accomplished in days what our scientists failed to achieve in decades. We owe you our lives. I have some bad news. Our bernicium mines were destroyed in the last series of quakes. The ore's buried under sixty gigatons of rock. We can't get to it. We hoped you'd accept this instead. A rubidium geode. Priceless. The only one ever found on our planet. I'm sorry, this is all we can offer you. Please, we need the ore to repair our replicator systems. Without it, we'll be unable to feed our people. No! I'll have the ore transported at once. This, this was all a misunderstanding. Yes. Oh! Pardon me. [Ready room]
