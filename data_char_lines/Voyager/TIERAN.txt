I will admit that you surprised me. Who would have imagined that such fierce determination existed within that deceptively frail body. My dear, why should we be enemies? Why waste the energy in conflict when we could achieve so much more by cooperating. You're already a part of them. You and I have killed together, remember? And you will continue to serve my will. You really have no choice. Wouldn't it be wiser to join me? To take advantage of all I have to offer. You may find that you enjoy having power. I assure you, it is the finest aphrodisiac there is. So, you insist on making this a battle. How foolish. Brave words. You've been an annoyance to me, nothing more. I've suffered pain all my life. It's going to take more than headaches to stop me. And I don't ask for any. What I need from you I already have. Your body and your mind. You may resist and try to fight me, but eventually I will defeat you. I haven't existed for two centuries to be brought down by a child!
