You are in Kazon-Ogla space, Federation. (Everyone say Hi! to  Aron Eisenberg.) No one who violates Ogla space leaves. I am not your son, Federation. I am your executioner. What am I doing here? What? You should've let me die. What? Why do you want to know my name? I'm called Kar. Kill me. Please. Because there are worse things than being killed by your enemy. (The tiny shuttlecraft is dragged into the massive Kazon ship.) [Kazon trophy room] (Chakotay and Kar are thrown into an area hung with skins and trophies.) I was ready, Haliz, ready to kill or die. I felt the flames touch my skin. It was this fool, this Federation, who doesn't even have the courage to kill his enemies. He pulled me out with that transporter we've heard about. Like the Nistrim and the Relora before you, you come into our space, showing off your uniforms and displaying the markings of your Federation with no respect, as if you own this part of space. But it belongs to us! I tried to kill him, Haliz. (Haliz knocks Kar down.) I want to see Razik. Tell Razik I demand to see him. What are you doing? You see this? This is debris from a Nistrim frigate. The man you are demanding to see destroyed it, killing more than one hundred in a single shot. Before that, his name was only Ra. Now he is called Jal Razik. And this tunic belonged to a Relora warrior. He was killed by the bare hands of another Ogla, called only Hali. Now that man is called Jal Haliz, one of our greatest fighters. And this bracelet belonged to the man who killed my brother, my brother, Jal Kanal, who earned his Ogla name by dying bravely in battle. But I, I will never earn my name in life or in death, and I have you to thank for that. [Bridge] It was not my fault. It was his technology! No. No excuses. No. Please. (Razik kisses Kar, who bursts into tears.) If I stay here, I'll die without a name. And Razik taught me only cowards die without a name. Maybe not, but that's a chance I'm willing to take. I'll show you how to disable the weapons systems. [Shuttlecraft] (Kar and Chakotay fly away from the Kazon ship.) Will Razik be all right? No! Their ship is much clumsier at lower speeds. We should try to outmanoeuvre them. I can give you the shield frequencies of their ship. We can hit them back easily. You'd rather die in your sleep a wrinkled old man? That's Tarok, where the Ogla conduct training exercises. It worked? In battle? That wasn't a battle. We didn't even shoot back. And now I'm stranded here with you. You don't You don't know what you're doing. Get down. (Kar throws a stone and a beam blasts it to atoms.) A proton beam. They're hidden everywhere, along with biomagnetic traps and disruptor snares. I told you, the Ogla train on this moon. I was here myself last year with Razik. I know that you're in my territory. And if you want to live to become that wrinkled old man, you're going to have to do what I say. What are you doing? What for? They won't come. They'll think you're dead. Maybe I should kill you, and steal your technology and deliver it to my people. Then they'd have to give me my name. You won't stop me from earning my name, Federation. Did you have to earn it? Then your name means nothing. I should respect you because you wear that uniform? What did you have to do to earn your uniform? I suppose they don't expect you to prove your battle skills. You're saying that my name and your uniform mean the same thing, but you're wrong. I must protect my territory. Territory is power. Fine. What do you mean? You were awake? I am a coward. If you are my friend, then you're my only one. What happens to me now? Where do I go? I would be a goven, an outcast. Each Kazon sect I meet would cut one digit off, and send me away. It changes every day. Yesterday there were eighteen. To do what, dress in a uniform? And the closer you get to your home, the farther I would be from mine. If only you had killed me. [Tarok] The Trabe. The Kazon shared their homeworld, if you can call it sharing. They had everything, we had nothing, until we took it from them in the revolt, twenty six years ago. (The tricorder beeps.) What is it? What are we going to do? But how? Why are you doing this?  I've been waiting for you, Razik. I only came with him so I could have another chance to kill him. That's what I've been hoping for, Razik. But you taught me well. I know what you're going to say. You've said it so many times before. In battle, there are no second chances. (The Voyager group enter.) (to Chakotay) But you are not my enemy, he is. (Kar shoots Razik.) My name is Jal Karden, Kazon-Ogla. You are First Maje now, Haliz. My life is yours. Kill me if you wish, or let me live and I will follow you into battle whenever you command. The Federation does not belong here. If we meet again, I will not hesitate to kill you.
