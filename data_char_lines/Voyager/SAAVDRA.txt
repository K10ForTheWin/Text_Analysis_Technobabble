That was before the Nakan started shooting. Civilians with particle weapons.  What do our spotters report? Once we've disabled their shield generators, we'll deploy units five and six. They may be unarmed, but they won't be happy to see us. Don't provoke them. I want to come out of this with zero casualties on both sides. Once we've secured the village, take the colonists there. Get them aboard. Do your best to reassure them. Make them understand that this is a temporary relocation. That they're going to be back there in a few weeks. Understood? Problem? I promised Command we'd have this colony secured today. I'm sorry. But when this mission's over, how does a week on Toranius Prime sound? Compared to this place, it's paradise. [Briefing room] Transport's on approach. Stand aside. They were never here. We disabled their shield generators, entered the colony and they were gone. They will if we all keep to the same story. Then you say nothing. In self defence. No, they won't. Move away. I said, move away! [Mess hall]
