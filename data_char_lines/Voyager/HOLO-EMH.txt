Please state the nature of the medical emergency. Nonsense. You have second-degree phaser burns. Please have a seat on biobed one. You require treatment. Twenty cc's nitric acid. A little proverbial salt in the wound. (Paris screams in pain. Tuvok disarms the EMH, who then hits him and starts to strangle him.) You're looking well. It was a pleasure treating you. Don't hesitate to call again. (The Holo-EMH throws them both out of his Sickbay.) [Holographic Corridor]
