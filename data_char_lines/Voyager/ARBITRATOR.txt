You've made a persuasive argument, Commander, but there's a flaw in your logic. As you point out, the law says that the creator of an artistic work must be a person. Your EMH doesn't meet that criteria. This hearing is in recess until tomorrow. [Briefing room]  That only proves the Doctor's programme can be modified. That's hardly commendable behaviour. [Astrometrics lab]  You'll have my decision in two days. [Astrometrics lab] ARBITRATOR  We're exploring new territory today, so it is fitting that this hearing is being held at Pathfinder. The Doctor exhibits many of the traits we associate with a person. Intelligence, creativity, ambition, even fallibility. But are these traits real, or is the Doctor merely programmed to simulate them? To be honest, I don't know. Eventually we will have to decide, because the issue of holographic rights isn't going to go away. But at this time, I am not prepared to rule that the Doctor is a person under the law. However, it is obvious he is no ordinary hologram and while I can't say with certainty that he is a person, I am willing to extend the legal definition of artist to include the Doctor. I therefore rule that he has the right to control his work.Â I'm ordering all copies of his holo-novels to be recalled immediately. This hearing is adjourned.
