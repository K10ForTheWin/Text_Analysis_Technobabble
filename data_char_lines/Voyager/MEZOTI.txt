If we're not analysing the nebula, why did we enter it? Is Voyager in danger? This has something to do with deck twelve, doesn't it? That's because it's haunted, isn't it? Naomi. If it's not a ghost, what is it? We're not faint of heart. So don't leave anything out.  What was it? What kind of stowaway? Was it non-corporeal? Maybe it was an inter-phasic species. Neelix! Snacks are irrelevant. Continue the story. Then what happened? [Cargo Bay two - then] NEELIX Stop interrupting. [Cargo Bay two - then] NEELIX The entity must have infiltrated her cybernetic systems and turned her against the rest of the crew. I'm not frightened, but Azan is.  Were you scared? Explain. I was afraid once. It was when we were first disconnected from the hive mind, before Seven rescued us. I couldn't hear anyone else's thoughts anymore. I felt alone. Yes.  What did the bodies like? After eighty years. Were they decomposed? Maybe they ate each other.  Captain Janeway served you nebular gas? The creature was that angry? I told you there was a monster on deck twelve. Naomi told me you always exaggerate.
 Hello? [Kobali Shuttle]  My designation is Mezoti. [Kobali Shuttle]  I'm eight. [Kobali Shuttle] My species is six eight nine. [Astrometrics lab]  Norcadian. What species are you? [Kobali Shuttle]  Explain.  I'll try, but my height may be insufficient. (She is right. In trying to reach up to the top of the screen, she rests her hand on another console and cuts off the transmission.) [Kobali shuttle] Are you going to report me to the captain? To wait in the Cargo Bay until you returned. I'm trying to talk to the woman. The one transmitting from spatial grid two three six nine. I could show you how to do it. It's not irrelevant. A wider variety of activities. Azan is using his neural interface to share information. SEVEN: Is this true? You will exercise punishment protocol nine alpha. (Azan and Rebi leave the table. Icheb stands.) I don't care. (Mezoti is creating a bust. Seven enters.) Can't you tell? It's you. Look. Here's your ocular implant, your nose, your mouth. This was more fun. Don't you like it? Your friend won't mind? Seven's letting us go to the holodeck by ourselves. She says we can run any programme we want. Do you want to come? Sounds boring.
It's a Teirenian ant colony. I infused the soil with a blue ion dye so it'd be easier to see the insects. The drones produce a fluorescent enzyme that's activated by the Queen. I like bugs. If you leave, who is going to help us with our science projects? I can't regenerate. I miss Icheb. If you find my parents, will I have to go with them? I hope you don't find them. Seven? What if the Borg try to assimilate Icheb again? But what if Icheb's on a ship? He was on a ship last time. No, he wasn't. A class one transport was detected in grid six four nine. One lifeform. Species, Brunali. [Astrometrics lab]
She's like us. (The other teen boy steps forward.) We could fix her. We're a Collective. One of these captives was attempting to disconnect the security field. He learnt his lesson. Why? A theta class planetoid. population two and sixty million. Binary suns. It's not adapting. Let Seven help. Why is it doing that? You left these. (She holds up Queen of Hearts.)MEZOTI:Â I like her. She looks like Seven of Nine. Your weapon won't work here. Dampening field. [Corridor] Irrelevant?  The other captives are gone. One mind, one voice. We'll find a new home. You'll see.  Do we have to regenerate now? My designation is Mezoti. It's a pretty name.
You can still come with us. Adapting to your absence will be difficult. I've been studying all available data relevant to this species, as you recommended. On Wysanti, it is not customary to say goodbye but, I think I prefer the human way. (Mezoti hugs Seven, then the twins do the same.)
