Another three hours. [Voyager 2 - Engineering] TORRES Understood. [Voyager 2 - Bridge] JANEWAY Understood. [Voyager 2 - Sickbay] JANEWAY So I ran a multispectral analysis on the subspace turbulence. It was more than just turbulence. It was some kind of divergence field. And the moment we passed through it, all of our sensor readings doubled. Mass, energy output, bio-signatures, everything. Every particle of matter on this ship seems to have been duplicated in that instant. So the antimatter on the ships wasn't duplicated. Both engines have been trying to draw power from a single source of antimatter. Right. Five times on forty seven different frequencies. I think so, but in order to get them to do that, we'd have to communicate with them first. It's the chicken and the egg. A rotating band pulse might do it, but it wouldn't be much more than a shrill whistle. Not much at this point. We can use the emergency encryption code for a short message. Not more than five seconds. But we aren't merging. In fact, we're going further out of phase! [Engineering] I'm not sure. I think the plasma flow became to turbulent. The divergence fields were so chaotic, we couldn't complete the merging. We've lost the comm. link as well. Captain, the antimatter leak? It's becoming a haemorrhage. If we don't start the proton bursts, we'll be completely drained in thirty minutes. I will, but remember, we have fewer than thirty minutes of antimatter left. Whatever you do over there, do it fast.
