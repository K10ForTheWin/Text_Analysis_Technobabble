The negotiations? Incoming transmission for Captain Janeway. Transport complete. USS Voyager. Intrepid class, fifteen decks of the most advanced technology you'll find anywhere. Dilithium powered warp engines, integrated bioneural circuitry, holodecks. As do we. Photon torpedoes, optronically targeted phasers, multi-spectral shielding. The process is complicated, but Captain Janeway has influence with the Federation Council. Captain, our latest orders from Starfleet Command. We won't be back here for at least six months. We have an additional problem. Voyager. [Bridge]  Voyager's charging weapons. Going back is too dangerous. No, she's not. And even if she were, we wouldn't be able to rescue her. We'd be captured ourselves. It's too late for that. What's logical is to get as far away as we can. Activate the shields. Our Janeway or theirs? How were you able to escape? [on viewscreen]: It's difficult to believe you weren't detected. Being cautious. How do we know this isn't a deception? You could be helping Voyager capture us in exchange for your own freedom. They're exactly where we left them. You're not in command here. I was right. You brought them here. We'll need at least ten if we're going to beam all that bolomite through the geostrata. We? In six years I've never known you to dirty your hands with menial labour. You don't trust us. It's all right. We'll all go together. That's the last of them. We can go now. If that's acceptable to you, Captain. I told you she couldn't be trusted. You're not transporting anything. (Zar tries to draw his weapon, and gets shot first. Mobar's phaser beam goes straight through Dala.) What did they promise you for betraying us? Where's Dala?
