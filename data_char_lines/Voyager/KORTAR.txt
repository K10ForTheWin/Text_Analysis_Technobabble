Is this the mongrel child you spoke of. B'Elanna, daughter of Miral. It's not your time. You've come close to boarding this ship many times. I remember the first. You were a child. Your mother took you to the Sea of Gatan. Your curiosity was as deep as the water. When your mother breathed life back into your lungs, she told you about me. Ah. You remember me. And as punishment, I was condemned to ferry the souls of the dishonoured to Gre'thor. (Torres spots a bat'leth hanging on a mast, and sidles towards it.) If you didn't still believe, you wouldn't be here. (She grabs the bat'leth.)KORTAR:  Foolish girl. (He seizes the blade.)KORTAR: You cannot harm me. I'm already dead. (He takes the bat'leth off her, cutting her palm in the process. The storm gets worse.) The soul of another dishonoured warrior is being delivered. (A woman appears on the deck.)  The mongrel child has returned. You wish to claim her dishonour as your own? You're willing to die for her? Keep her quiet! BROK'TAN: Silence. (He puts his hand over Miral's mouth.)KORTAR:  It's not your decision. She has the right to reclaim your honour. Once we've reached Gre'thor and you are within its gates, I will release her. You're very impatient. Time must be slipping away in the living world. You're concerned that your friends will revive you before you complete your deception. Did you really think that I could be fooled so easily? If you choose this path, your friends will not be able to save you. Your dishonour has been lifted. Sto-Vo-Kor awaits you. She has made the choice. Go! (Miral vanishes. The Barge arrives at the gates of a fortress.)KORTAR: Daughter of Miral, embrace your fate.(Torres steps onto the gangplank, and the gates open to reveal a world of flame inside.) [Sickbay]
