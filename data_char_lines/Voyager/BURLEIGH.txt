Presently. Yes. Terribly wrong. (Lord Burleigh kisses Janeway.) I have fallen in love with you, Lucy. Nothing, thank you. I didn't know Beatrice could play the piano. (Beatrice drops the flowered tea cup.) Mrs Templeton, please take the children to the nursery. Please stay here, Mrs Davenport. I want you here. Those are questions you must not ask. Don't pursue this, I beg you. Lucy. Thank God you've come back. Why are you dressed so strangely? You'd look lovely in anything. I've thought of you constantly. Remembered your touch, your perfume, your lips
Forgive me. I've startled you. Mrs Davenport, I'll come to the point. I am not an easy man to live with. Since my wife died I'm told I'm even worse. She was a buffer for me. The children are the ones who've suffered. I've not been much of a father to them, and God knows I can't be a mother. I'm not asking that you replace their mother, but I think that they'll respond to a woman's sensibilities. You might fill a void in their lives. Young Henry is sometimes a bit stubborn and little Beatrice misses her mother terribly. I hope they won't make things difficult for you. One thing above all I must demand. You are never, under any circumstances, to go onto the fourth floor. Is that clear?
