Icheb. That's a Borg designation, isn't it? How are you? Do these hurt you? (The remains of his cortical implant by the bridge of his nose.) It won't be easy for him to give up the luxuries of your ship. Our children go to school. We're perfectly capable of protecting our son. Come, sit down. Mister Neelix let me use his galley to prepare some poma. It was your favourite food when you were little. No. No, you're not. You inherited your love of the stars from your father. You see? We have everything we need right here. A warm fire, good food that we grow ourselves, and people who love us. You've grown attached to the crew on that ship, haven't you? Why is that so important to them? What would that accomplish? The longer we wait the harder it'll be for everyone. You know that. It's what he was born for. He's not an ordinary child. Leucon, his return was a gift. We can't waste it. To survive, we all have to make sacrifices. You taught me that. (Icheb enters.) Sit down, Icheb. We need to talk. You know that you're very important to us. What you don't know is why. If you relax, it won't hurt you. You'd better hold him. Prepare the launch. [Bridge] Questions? We don't owe you any explanations. That's not your concern. He's fighting for his people. No. Our genetic expertise. We're trying to save our civilisation. If we don't stop the Borg, the Brunali have no future.
