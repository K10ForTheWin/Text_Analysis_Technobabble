Father! (Ameron tries to attack Tieran.) Tieran? You murdered my father right in front of me. Demmas is the rightful heir, not you. It's the law. You mean if I join you. After what you've done? Tieran! (Ameron briefly touches Tieran's hand before Demmas pulls him off. Neelix puts the cortical stimulator onto Tieran.)
