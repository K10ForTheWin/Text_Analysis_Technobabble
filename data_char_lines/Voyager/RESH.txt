What is this? Nori! I heard your ship had been destroyed. That's Tieran? Oh, I'm very relieved you survived. But we can't go ahead with the attack now! This is insane. We've spent years planning this, every move, every detail, and now suddenly our leader's been reduced to a little girl? You shall have it. Sir. Captain's log, stardate 50351.4. We're holding a meeting with Demmas, the Autarch's eldest son and heir, in an effort to understand the recent hostile activity. [Briefing room] He should have been here. Demmas has acquired two more ships. Everyone stay where you are. Get that off! (Resh removes the device and reveals Tuvok.) The Voyager's leaving orbit. Yes, sir, but, with all due respect, why? Demmas is on that ship. Our warships are in position to destroy it. Sir, enemy ships are approaching. At least twenty. It's Demmas's fleet, and Voyager. Yes, but we are outnumbered. All the same, I recommend taking some precautions. We should get you to the reinforced shelter. They've made it through our defences. They're sending down ground forces. I'm sending additional troops to the defensive positions. Activating full security measures. That ought to hold them off, but we have to go. Now. Look for yourself! (More shaking.)
