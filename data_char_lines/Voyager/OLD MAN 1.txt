Who are you? Why are your asking me? I've lost track. I didn't hear anyone say that, did you? She thinks she is, at any rate. How many times do we have to tell you that we are waiting? I wonder if she's always this impatient. I told you. I told you it was locked. (Janeway knocks on the door three times and it opens.) Well, look who's come back. So, your little adventure didn't quite work out the way you'd planned it. You put yourself through a lot of trouble and for nothing, didn't you. Stubborn, I'd say. You didn't really consider sitting and waiting with us, did you? That would be nice and quantifiable for you, wouldn't it. If the spirits were something you could see and touch and scan with your little devices. So much for your tolerant open-minded Starfleet ideals. Fine. Don't embrace a thing. It's all the same to us. Go on back to your ship and play with your molecular microscanner. Be honest. You won't like it. Kill her. She's as good as dead already, finish the job! Give her another jolt of that what do you call it, biogenic field. There you go again, always looking for a rational explanation. Well there isn't one. Your orbital scans and medical research have given you the facts, and they tell you the biogenic field is lethal. But if you go in with any doubt, with any hesitation, then you're both dead. So, what are you going to do, Captain?
