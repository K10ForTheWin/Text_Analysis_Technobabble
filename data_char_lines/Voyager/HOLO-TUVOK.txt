 We are entering the Rukani sector, Commander. Aye, sir. I assure you, Commander. I have made thorough preparations for the Captain's safety during her away mission. You, on the other hand, are still adapting to your duties as First Officer. Under the circumstances, I believe my time will be better spent assisting you in your effort to justify the trust the Captain has placed in you. Aye, sir. Ensign Kim, you have been given a direct order. Do as the Commander tells you. Is something wrong, sir? The Captain's shuttle has gone to warp. Sir? What did you have in mind, Ensign? We will indeed attempt to do so when the time is right. Such a foolhardy proposal suggests a lack of proper training. Need I remind you that we are confined behind an electrostatic forcefield? We are hardly doing nothing. We are observing the enemy, watching for any discernible patterns in their procedures, looking for any weakness in their defences. I am not concerned with your amusement, Ensign. We are in a crisis situation, and we will follow procedure. And procedure dictates that we wait for the right opportunity to attempt an escape, whether it takes an hour or a week.
