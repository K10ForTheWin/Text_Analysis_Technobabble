If anybody on this world can help you, Professor Ren can. He's developed four generations of navigational arrays for our ships. Captain. It's unfortunate we must meet under these circumstances. Please. (They sit around his desk.) Oh, I'm afraid he's been more than just accused. He's been convicted and punished according to our law. The perpetrator of a murder is forced to relive the crime through his victim's eyes. I can have our Chief Medical officer describe the procedure in detail if you wish. We have the capability of isolating memory engrams in the brain. We take them from the final moments of life. After they're used in the trial, they're transplanted into the perpetrator's brain. An artificial life form serves as host to the engrams and testifies to their content. In this case, the victim's last memories clearly show Mister Paris caught in an embarrassing episode with Mrs Ren. An argument ensues. Paris is then seen by the victim's own eyes, killing him. The evidence of his guilt is incontrovertible. [Room] (At the detention centre, Paris is brought in by the doctor.) Of course. (Kray and the doctor leave.) I'm sorry, but I can't authorise that. All right, but you're not to leave orbit with him. We are not a barbaric people, Captain. This was meant as punishment, not torture. I see no alternative but to remove the implants, do you? I cannot assure you'll find an alternative sentence more to your liking. When do you intend to return him to our custody? Not the man? But it was clearly established at the trial. Is this just idle speculation, or do you have some evidence? What? You're saying somebody used his brain to send secret data to our enemy? Do you know who did this? I really would like you to listen, doctor.
