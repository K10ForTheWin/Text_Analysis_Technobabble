Bringing him here was a mistake. We have their shield frequencies. We should target their bridge. Your friends are trying to destroy us. We should kill them. We should go to warp.  They've been in the lab for two hours. She's an engineer, Iden. For all we know, she's trying to sabotage the ship. At least let me see what they're doing. Even after you kidnapped his friend? I hope you're right. Not all of us were programmed with your, er, your spiritual beliefs. (The EMH helps Torres into the room. She sees all the different races represented, including a Romulan.) Two. Both Venatic class. Half a light year. Less than two hours. They're hunters, Doctor. They were bound to pick up our trail eventually. Aye, sir. We detected a vessel. No, the Nuu'bari. I intercepted one of their comm. transmissions. IDEN Origin? Two million kilometres outside the nebula. They're in visual range. Two organic, three photonic. They're powering warp engines. Their shields are down. Torpedoes armed. Bridge to Iden. We're approaching Ha'Dara. Less than two minutes.  Voyager's disabled both hunting vessels. They've lost shields, weapons. We should hail Janeway. Thank her. I think so. Why? (Whumph!)WEISS: That was Voyager. They're trying to disable our shields.  There are thirty four hunters on the surface. Who's the prey now?
