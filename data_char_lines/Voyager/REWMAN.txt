Yes, Lieutenant. (Kes and Neelix are beamed out. A pair of monks arrive.)
This is transporter room two. Your comm. signal was routed here, sir.
Bridge to Doctor. Medical emergency.  [Bridge] Engineering to Lieutenant Torres. We're having a problem with the plasma manifold. I thought you'd want to take a look.
Bridge to the Captain. You have an incoming transmission from the planet.
I can't lock onto him. His pattern keeps changing. I got him! I got him! Over there! Shut it all down! (A phaser shot disables the monitor.)
Negative, Commander. I'm not reading any sign of her.
We have him, Captain. He's all right. (Whumph!) Aye, Captain. All I got was his comm. badge, Captain.
Aye sir. [Transporter room 3] (The transport completes. The aliens look like they are constructed from bits and pieces, like Frankenstein's poor monster.)
Engineering is secure. Transporter room one is under control. Shuttlebay is secured, Commander.
Captain Ranek, please come to the bridge. We've received an encrypted transmission.
Bridge to captain. We're being hailed. A vessel off the port bow.
Bridge to Ensign Kim. The Captain can see you now.
Go ahead. Understood.
Chief Examiner Nimira wants to see you. She's requesting permission to transport aboard.
