Who's there? Come back later. I'm not scared of any tree monster, Miss Wildman, but, as you know, I need my beauty sleep. You and your missions. Lucky for you, your old pal Flotter has everything ready. Follow me. I've laid a trap. When he climbs this tree, he'll trip the alarm. Tree monsters are terrified of high-pitched noises. Oh, it's a well known fact. The bell will scare him high into those branches where counterweights will bend the treetop till it springs back, catapulting him pond-ward and, splash! He'll sink like a log. Details, details. (The bark-skinned tree monster looks down at them.) Flotter. Flotter T. Water III. She does. On a starship called Voyager. You know, for a monster, you're very polite. Well, he may not be a monster, but he is stealing my water with his roots. And I ought to chop you down! She's got a point. I told him not to touch it, but this blockhead never listens. (A branch is burning nearby.) Me? Hey, it worked! Watch this. (Flotter sprays the burning branch with water from his finger, and it goes out.) Who's the furball? In a flash. The Ogre? Who's he? (A fireball appears.) You lied. Naomi re-liquefied me. Now leave. I wonder if this liar can swim? No more lying. Ion storm? What's that? Naomi, don't leave us. Now that you mention it, I'm feeling a little washed out. Samantha? Is it really you? You're all grown up. I've missed you. Now that you mention it, there is a castle that I've been meaning to explore. I hear a giant beetle lives there.
