General Valen. Welcome to the Void. I know. I've been observing you on sensors. The way you fought those ships was impressive. Most vessels don't survive the first few minutes.  The anomaly's a closed structure, encased by an inert layer of subspace. Matter and energy can't penetrate it. By the funnels. But they only pull matter in one direction. Into the void. There's nothing to explore, but it's big. We've calculated the outer circumference at approximately nine light years, but we've never been able to breech it. More than five years. New arrivals are always thinking about escape. You're being naive. No one ever gets out. Many have tried. All they did was waste resources that could have kept them alive longer. Don't be foolish. I can help you. The only source of food and energy in the Void comes from new ships that are drawn in. If you want to survive here, you'll have to compete for their resources. I have tactical data on some of the more dangerous predators. My scans show you have photon torpedoes. Why not? Wait a few weeks until your resources start to run out. Morality won't keep your life support systems running. Not yet. [Engineering] I don't know what you mean. We didn't take any of that from you. That's not the way things work here. My fight's not with you, Captain. This new ship has impressive technology. We can share it. Then why are you here? What are they to you? Save your speeches. I've got a crew to feed. Don't underestimate Janeway. I've been in battle with her twice.
