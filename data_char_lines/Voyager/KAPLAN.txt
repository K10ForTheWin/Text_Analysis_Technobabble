Sir, I'm picking up an EM signal from the planet surface. It's directed at our co-ordinates. Shall I respond, sir? Aye, sir.
The nebula's completely scrambling our navigational readings. I still can't get a fix on our position. That depends what you mean by lost, sir. I'm sorry, sir. No response. We must still be out of comm. range. Aye, sir. Er, sir. That asteroid field? It's the same one we passed two hours ago. It's a Federation hailing beacon, originating bearing three oh nine mark four. It's Voyager. Setting a course. (They arrive in orbit of a planet.) Is it possible Voyager's landed? I'm getting another hail. The signal's very weak, and it's definitely not being sent by Voyager. We lost them, sir. Who would know that? This place looks like a war zone. Commander. Commander! (One figure raises his weapon, and Kaplan pushes Chakotay aside. Everyone takes cover and starts shooting. Kaplan gets hit, then Chakotay is jumped from behind. They struggle, and Chakotay knocks out his attacker. One person carefully aims his weapon and stuns Chakotay, but is then driven off by a new group arriving.)
