God, if you let me live through this, I promise I'll clean up my act. I swear. Man, have you looked in a mirror lately? Ginsberg. Er, Maury Ginsberg. Wait a minute. Weren't you the guy in the jeep? Oh, man, he was a lifesaver. My van died and they dragged it off the road because of all the traffic. It was backed up for miles. Yeah, I was supposed to be on the follow spot up on tower three. I never would have made it in time if it weren't for him. Hey, whatever happened with that groovy chick with the long red beads in the back seat? I've been looking for her ever since you dropped me off. Oh, it was no big deal. Somebody must have snagged an extension cord with one of the trucks, that's all. I'm just lucky I noticed it. Far out.
