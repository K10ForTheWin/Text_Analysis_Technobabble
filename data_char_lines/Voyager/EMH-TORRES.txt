Computer, access medical file Torres Three and update her holographic template. (The baby bump appears. S/he waits until Torres has left Engineering.) [Engineering] I did, actually. Where do we keep the spare gel packs? Of course. Gamma five. I know where it is, Ensign.(S/he gets on the lift.) [Engineering upper level] Lieutenant. Er, you startled me. How thoughtful, but I'm not hungry. A pregnant woman shouldn't eat this kind of food. Do you want to give me an arterial occlusion? You know, this all looks so delicious. Why don't we save it for a romantic dinner this evening? I'll be there. Sweetheart. (Chakotay's voice) Harry, I'll be right there. Chakotay out. [Astrometrics lab] I think the Doctor's heading for the escape pods. (Tuvok closes his tricorder and draws his phaser.)EMH-TORRES: You wouldn't shoot a pregnant woman, would you?
