Could I have your attention? Now that you've all arrived here safely I'd like to welcome you to your new home. Your vessel will be used to defend Nyrian acquisitions. Ships, colonies, spacestations. We've found it's much more effective than warfare. We aren't a cruel people. We've tried to make this experience as painless as possible. And as you can see, we've gone to great lengths to create an environment in which you will be comfortable. Well, I'm afraid that's unavoidable. But I think you'll be happy here. The food dispensers have been programmed with selections from your own computer files. We have even downloaded literature and entertainment from your cultural database. I think you'll find there's nowhere to go. Captain, your lack of gratitude is unbecoming. You and your crew could have found yourselves somewhere far less hospitable. If you want to be miserable here, that is your choice. But since there's nothing you can do about your situation, I suggest you accept it. Gracefully. We're ready now. (The Nyrians beam away.) We are attempting to do that now. However, if they resist, stronger measures may become necessary. Taleen to Dammar. Some of the lifeforms have accessed the control system. They have weapons. We need reinforcements. Stop! (Torres and Paris go inside.) Follow them. That's an order. [Control room]
