 You're doing a wonderful job, Doctor. I'm just giving him a little encouragement. If all goes well, we should have the warp core in less than six hours. He's making excellent progress. Everything appears to be normal. Maybe we should let her go. It's better than being sent to a rehabilitation centre. Ha! I've rebuilt dozens of these units, but I've never seen this configuration before. Do you know how I can stabilise the ion flow? (Janeway gestures to him to bring it closer.) Thank you. Oh, those aren't for this ship. I've been collecting and repairing spare components for years. This is from an old impulse drive. Would you believe I found it sitting in a waste depository? I'll be able to find a buyer now that it's working. That's exactly what I think. I'm going to use my quarter of the profits to establish an outpost specialising in obsolete engine components. I'm certain there's a demand for them. It's in the cargo hold. I had no idea he was going to do this. I'm sorry. I need to upload your first assignment. (The EMH steps out and Nar beams the programme into the mobile emitter.) I've given you the rank of a Class One Overseer. You'll be able to walk into Central Command without anyone noticing. I've also uploaded several other holographic templates you might find useful. (The EMH flickers.) I'm not certain. I told you his programme couldn't handle that much data. (The EMH's appearance flickers and changes rapidly.) He won't be any use to us if he decompiles. (The shuttlecraft attacks as Paris beams into the Flyer. He starts to power it up.) Someone's boarded the Delta Flyer. They're moving away. What are you doing? That would kill them. (A pair of hits from Starfleet weapons make the forcefield drop. Janeway dashes for a control panel.) Guess this wasn't so useless after all. (He helps Janeway up.) Are you still interested in acquiring my inventory? [Holodeck]
