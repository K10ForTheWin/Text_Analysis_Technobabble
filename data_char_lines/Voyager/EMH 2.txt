 Good news, Ensign. Our baby is perfectly healthy. There's no sign of any interspecies abnormalities. A figure of speech. I am, in part, responsible for bringing her into the world. You may hold her now. She's still unconscious. There's a slight phase shift in her DNA. Do you have any theory about where she came from? I believe so. If you're right, where is the other ship? A parallel universe, another dimension, another point in time? Right away. However, I should forewarn you that her incisors will erupt within three to four weeks. Since your skin lacks the scales of a Ktarian, we'll have to discuss alternatives. In twenty four hours. I want observe the infant to make sure there's no more damage to her cell membranes. Kes. Kes? Are you all right? What do you mean? The same thing happened here. The transport was successful. I'm sorry to hear that. But try to understand, it wasn't your fault. The situation was out of your control. The Captain's working on it, Kes. In the meantime, try to get some rest. Besides, I'm sure your Voyager is also equipped with a proficient Emergency Medical Hologram. [Voyager 2 - Engineering] TORRES  I've erected an emergency force field around Sickbay. That should hold them off for a while. It's going to be all right, Ensign. Give her to me and I'll hide her inside an access port. If they do break in, it's unlikely they'll look for anyone there. Trust me, Ensign. I won't let anyone touch our baby. Lieutenant, give me a hand. Move this. We're going to have to cut away the internal circuitry to make room Ensign Kim, is that you? Have we retaken the ship? Well, I, I guess you'd better hurry then. Ensign. Tell my counterpart that I've corrected all signs of hemocythemia. He'll know what that means.
