We're real glad you dropped by. Hey, let me show you around. The root cellar's right over there. Potatoes, onions. But it's real private. Oh, nothing but a big old pile of hay. Hey, come on, let's go see the duck pond. There's nothing in there. It's just a dark, smelly barn. Hey, do y'all want some devilled eggs? Huh? (Paris and Kim move the girl aside and enter.)  [Barn] See? Nothing but hay. I'm not ready for you yet! (The girl blocks their way and the dog snarls at them.)
