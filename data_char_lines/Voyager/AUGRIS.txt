I believe you, but some of my colleagues are cautious about dealing with disreputable ships. It seems you've been making more enemies than friends since you arrived from the Alpha quadrant, is it? Some think even that story is a lie. Of course not. I'm here to help. I'm afraid that will be difficult in the current climate of mistrust. Perhaps if you could tell us more about what brought you here, who you've been dealing with. You're not making it very easy for me to help you. Let me see what I can arrange. It may take some time.

I thought you'd learnt that lesson when you lost your daughter. She made it as far as the tunnels before she was shot. So much tragedy for one man to bear. And now your foolishness has condemned another innocent woman. Take the others back for questioning. I'll interrogate this one myself.
