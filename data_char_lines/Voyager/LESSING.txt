I don't believe we've met. Lessing, Noah. What are you doing on this side of the galaxy? Do me a favour? See if my legs are still there. I haven't felt them in two days. Thank you. Too late for that. [Equinox - crew quarters]  How's my angel of mercy? You have an outstanding EMH. Ours can barely hold a laser scalpel. I've been assigned to help you sort through our bio-data. You saved my life. The least I can do is save you a little time.(They hear the noise of a fissure opening.) [Bridge] Maybe we should abandon ship. Try to forget everything that's happened here. You can count on me, sir. I can't. Warp drive is down. Sir, engines are up and running. It looks like they're under attack. Aye, sir. Warp drive ready. We also found a few deuterium deposits. Aye, sir. [Equinox Sickbay]  I'm reading a vein of ore. Azimuth one seventeen, thirty metres. It could run pretty deep. We might need to use phasers to excavate it. It's funny, this reminds me of McKinley Park. I used to take my sister there when we were kids. This place looks just like it. As I recall, there was a family of ground squirrels who lived right over there. There was a patch of poison ivy next to it. When I was ten, I walked right through it and I swelled up like a Rigellian bloodworm. When I get back to Earth the first thing I'm going to do is (His companion gets knocked out by a rifle butt, and he gets stunned.) Or what, you'll hit me? That would be murder. I suppose the plan is that you're going to come to my rescue now, right? No way in hell.
