I told you not to bring her here. It's too great a risk. You do not speak for all of us. PetaQ! I'll rip your heart out. If you come here again, you'll be putting your starship at risk and all of us as well. She's right. What can we hope to achieve?  Tell your hunters to patrol the north-eastern perimeter. More drones were spotted there. Where's that virus you promised? Good. The Borg have increased their attacks here. They're identifying us one by one. If you're looking for your mate, he's not here. That or he's dead. He should have been here hours ago. No one's seen him. If he died in battle, I'm sure it was honourable. Here. help Some advice from a warrior in the bedchamber as well as the battlefield. At times like these you must treat your heart as the enemy so you won't be distracted in battle. (There is a new arrival.) We need to coordinate a battle plan. A way to strike at the heart of the Collective. They fought like warriors. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten. There's no time. I'll see if any of our people are on a vessel near theirs. Starship Voyager, I am General Korok. This vessel is now under my command. We've come to join you in battle. [Borg Queen's Chamber]  Our emitters are fully charged. We have it. [Bridge] Match their shield modulations and fire. (Korok attacks the Cube, then Voyager comes in with torpedoes. Torres goes to a panel to see what is happening outside. Seven runs out of Astrometrics.) [Bridge]  Patience, Commander. They're trying to remodulate their secondary shield grid. [Bridge] KOROK  Shields in sub-grid forty two are destabilizing. Target that section. [Borg Queen's Chamber]
