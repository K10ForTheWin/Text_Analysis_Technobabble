Jen'to ka'siote, Jhet'leya. [Kim's quarters] I've come for Jhet'leya. She's my daughter. Please, I've come a long way. I only want to speak with her. [Corridor] I appreciate this, Captain. What have they done to you? You were so beautiful. It's good to see you, Jhet'leya. Why did you leave us? These people? The same ones who set you adrift in space? You abandoned her. We were acting in accordance with our customs. The reanimation process usually results in extensive memory loss, which makes the transition less painful. Unfortunately, some remember their former lives more than others. Jhet'leya, for example. Lyndsay Ballard. She's dead. She has been for three years. Forgive me for being so blunt, but when we found her she was a lifeless corpse. We salvaged that raw material to create a new person, You may have altered your appearance, but do you still think like these people? Even now, the first words that come into your head, are they in their language or mine? I realise this place is familiar to you, but it's not where you belong. Your sister misses you. She keeps asking when you're coming home. What should I tell her? I won't give her up, Captain. She's confused. I don't want to fight you. Every life is precious to my people, Captain. I won't be coming back alone. [Mess hall]
