Where am I? What do you want with me? Why have I been abducted? What is this place? My colony on Nyria Three. I was walking home, and then I was here. It's cold here, and too bright. Yes, thank you. You're very considerate. I hope you'll excuse my initial suspicion. This experience has been very unnerving. Not that I know of. I've heard of other races that have it. Maybe of them brought be here, but I can't imagine why. First I felt light-headed, and then everything around me seemed to bend or ripple. There was a moment of blackness and I felt a curious sensation of insects crawling on my skin. And then I found myself on your ship. We're on the third planet of the Nyrian system, a red giant star with a large cloud of interstellar dust just beyond the fifth planet. Of course.  Second team, take control of weapons.  [Bridge] (Two crew come to help Lang.)  What's our status? Not working? Find them. (Dammar takes the Captain's chair.) Send a patrol to stop him. Find them and put them back. If they leave you no other alternative, you have the authorisation to use force. (Transmission ends.) How soon can we go to warp? I want to get back there. We're on our way to you now. Increase speed to maximum velocity. Take us close enough to translocate our entire security force at once. Where are we? Get us out of here. Where's the portal? (Janeway translocates in.) You did this! And, and what would that be? Unacceptable. No! Wait! Captain's log, stardate 50929.6. The Nyrians have surrendered Voyager, and my crew is safely back on board. The former prisoners on the habitat vessel have contacted their native worlds, and are waiting to be taken home. [Holodeck - Paxau Resort] (Torres sits on a recliner next to Paris.)
