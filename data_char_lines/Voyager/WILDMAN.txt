In the lower back. It's tight. Shooting. It even goes down my legs. Is the baby all right? Well, that makes me feel better. The pain makes it difficult to sit for any period of time. It's really quite uncomfortable. Yes. Thank you, Doctor.
I've been considering naming him after my husband. It's been a tradition in his family for over five generations. My husband's name is Greskrendtregk. He's Ktarian. Have you had any progress, Doctor? To be honest, I've been thinking of something simpler. What do you think of Cameron? What about Frederick? It doesn't have to be a human name. I like Sural. It's Vulcan. I think it's lovely. Is it Ocampan? Thank you. Greskrendtregk would make a good middle name, don't you think? (Wildman leaves.)
Oh, we're doing just fine, thank you. I'd be happy to.  He's been working on a problem with the structural integrity grid. I'm sure he hasn't forgotten about you. Looks like you need a new set of anodyne relays. I'll go down to Engineering and get some for you out of storage. [Mess hall] Of course. I thought you didn't use replicated vegetables when you're cooking. Always fresh, organic, from the airponic bay. It looks like a malfunction in the power grid. Shouldn't be too difficult. (Wildman gasps and sits down.) I think I'm having a contraction. Oh, yeah! It's a contraction, all right. You push, damn it! I'm sick of pushing!  Oh! Oh, what was that? A pain in my abdomen. It's different. Sharp. Oh, God! Is she all right? Doctor? My baby, she, she's going to die, isn't she? Thank you. Thank you so much.
No, really, I'm all right. I don't know, Captain. She seems tired, listless. She has a fever. I don't know what to do.
