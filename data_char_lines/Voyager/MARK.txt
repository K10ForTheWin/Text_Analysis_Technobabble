So, when are you leaving? All right. Then I won't bother you anymore. I'll remember that. I already did, an hour ago. (Janeway blows a kiss and ends transmission. Doorbell.)
Don't you recognise the man you love? Kath, do you always have to be the captain? Can't you relax for a minute? I want to talk to you.
