The doctor called. And I was right. The puppies are due in seven weeks. With me? I just got the rugs cleaned. Is this another 'love me, love my dog' demand? How could I ever refuse you? So, when are you leaving? All right. Then I won't bother you anymore. I'll remember that. I already did, an hour ago. (Janeway blows a kiss and ends transmission. Doorbell.)
Kath, are you there? Kath, are you there? Come look at the puppies. I have missed you so much, Kath. When are you coming back? I don't think you've missed me. Someone else is in your thoughts now. (Janeway goes to the door, but it doesn't open.) Isn't that true? Isn't there someone you're thinking of? Don't you recognise the man you love? Kath, do you always have to be the captain? Can't you relax for a minute? I want to talk to you. Now, maybe you have time to talk to me. You're so strong, Kath. That's one of the things I always loved in you. (Mark tries to kiss her neck.) What's the matter? You used to love it when I kissed you there. What about the man on the holodeck? You didn't seem to mind him touching you, did you? In fact, I think you liked it. Now I ask you, Kath, is that fair to me? I've stayed faithful to you. I've vowed to wait for you no matter how long it takes. Shouldn't you do the same? Oh, Kath. (They kiss.) [Sickbay]
