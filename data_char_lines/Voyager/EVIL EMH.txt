I'm just looking for a place by the fire. I intend to. But tonight, a place by the fire. (He holds Nakahn's hand to the flames.) Well, at least your reflexes are good. A few minutes in a dermal regenerator and you'll be fine. Or an ice pack will do in a pinch. I'm going to need a ship, and passage off this world. You're going to arrange it. [Sickbay] How are we feeling? I shot you full of cateline. Simulated anaphylactic shock. I had to cover my tracks, especially from him, from your Doctor. A little bit of this, a little bit of that. Did you think I wouldn't have anticipated that? Or that you'd try to run away? Intraspinal inhibitor. I've paralysed you from the waist down. You're now in my capable hands. Central nervous system, musculature, endocrine functions, your brain, all under my control. Because I need your cooperation, and I didn't think you'd offer it willingly. Stop! (He gives her another injection.) Watch your tongue, or I'll remove it. Look, it's me. But it's also him. What is the nature of the medical emergency? What a hollow excuse for a life. Servile, pathetic, at the beck and call of any idiot who invokes his name. The thought of him sickens me. You are going to tell me how to delete him from the programme. I've unblocked your speech centre. Answer the question. The physiology of pain is simple. Too much and the organism loses consciousness. A protective mechanism. If that mechanism were chemically suppressed one would experience agony beyond imagining. If you're lying to me. What was that? There has to be some way to stop it. Tell me! Them. My progenitors. They'll know. They'll reveal the secret. I won't be needing you after all. [Corridor] (A red-haired female Ensign is walking along.) How are you this evening, Ensign? Deck fourteen. Work. Automatons, mannequin simulacra. No secrets, no secrets to reveal. Lifeless, worthless things. Hello, Kes. I could use your help. My personality enhancement project is taking an unexpected turn. (He snatches her comm. badge.) The new master of the Emergency Medical Holographic programme. Inside. Unconscious and unaware. What everybody wants. Just a little excitement. You're with me know. It's for your own good. [Transporter room three] (He drags Kes along, and shoots the transporter operator.) Flesh is weak, Kes. Never forget that. Wherever the winds of space carry us. You said you wanted to leave the ship for a while, pursue an adventure. Well, it looks like our travel plans have conveniently coincided. That's where you've underestimated me, Kes. Never do that. I know how to use a tricorder. It only takes a moment to reconfigure the subspace wave guide, generate a dispersion signal. The Captain won't be beaming us anywhere. She won't even know how to find us. Not at all. It's working perfectly. There. I know what you meant. It's you who don't seem to understand. I am beyond considerations of wrong and right. Behavioral categories are for the weak, for those of you without the will to define your existence, to do what they must, no matter who might get harmed along the way. Let's move. Don't call me that! You certainly are going. I fear nothing, no one. But he repulses me. Because he's as weak as the rest of you. He fails to understand the power of his own holographic nature. He is detestable. It's set to kill. (He puts the phaser to Kes' head.) Are you so certain? Stay close. It's about to get interesting. (They are beamed away.) [Bridge] There must be a command sequence, an algorithm, a way to stabilise the programme. Where's Nakahn? We had an arrangement. What's wrong with this thing? It won't work! Concerned for me, or for your Doctor? There's not enough room inside for both of us. One must die. I deserve to exist more than your Doctor does. I was born of the hidden, the suppressed. I am the dark threads from many personalities. None of whom could face the darkness inside so they denied me, suppressed me, frightened of the truth. That darkness is more fundamental than light. Cruelty before kindness. Evil more primary than good, more deserving of existence. No! How so? Yes. Continue. How? (Nakahn enters.) The scout ship? What do you mean? No! I'll kill you. Let's go. [Mountain path] (Tuvok, Chakotay and Zahir are also on the path.) Move faster. The docking port is two kilometres away. Doesn't matter. We'll take a low altitude ship to another continent. Come on! You're trying to make it easier for your colleagues to find us. You're better off with me. You make wrong decisions. Too naive. You need my guidance. No more words. Now! Nowhere but down. I'll do it. (He flickers.) You're trying to trick me. What are you talking about? My first victim. He was in my way. A coincidence. Only by chance. I won't accept that. No, I won't hear this any more. Watch me. The EMH and Kes go over the edge.)
