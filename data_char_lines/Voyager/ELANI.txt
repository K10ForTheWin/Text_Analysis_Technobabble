Are we going to fly in your ship? I don't want to stay here any more. I don't like it here. With cherel sauce. We can't be here when it's night. You can only see it when it comes for you. Then it's too late. We're scared. How? I feel like I want to run, but my legs won't work. Do you live your whole life without feeling anything? Where do I get to sit? Do they make you hear better? Sorry. (Tuvok puts Elani's hands together, with forefinger and thumb touching.) If Vulcans don't feel anything, does that mean you don't love them? I bet they miss you too. Is somebody coming to save us? Please, Tuvok. Help us! [Drayan moon] (The Drayans have found the empty shuttle. Tuvok and the children are hiding nearby.) No one ever comes back. Do you believe that? Will you help us? It's so dark. I always have my hair brushed before I go to sleep. I want music.
