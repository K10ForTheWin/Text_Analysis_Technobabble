I'll get it, Dad. Hey, B'Elanna, can you hand me a drink? Thanks. (B'Elanna sees the worm and screams, throwing the sandwich away. The boys laugh.) DEAN: My teacher said Klingons like live food. (B'Elanna grabs Dean's shirt.) It was just a joke. Don't be mad, B'Elanna. She just ran off down there. I was just kidding. I'm really sorry.
