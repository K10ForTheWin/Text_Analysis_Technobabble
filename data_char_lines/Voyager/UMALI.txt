 They're always looking for labourers at the Power Distribution Plant. Odd. They treat their employees well. How long were you there? It would be very simple for me to find out. A day? Not what I'd call an illustrious career. You were terminated, weren't you? That's quite an accomplishment during a labour shortage. What happened? I like a long story. Efficient? Then why should I hire you? There's no one else here. You'd better clean those tables over there. This place is going to be filled with hungry workers as soon as the next shift ends. Oh, I'm certain I will. (Later, when the bar is full of workers.) Tom? The proprietress doesn't give away drinks. You've been creating loyalty all night with those two women. I suggest you attend to the other tables. Here you are. Tom, I need you for a moment.
