Here it is. We're so proud of you, Hatil. This is such a generous, selfless act. And it's one we will always cherish. But I'm still going to miss you. Give my love to your father. Tell him that the garili trees he planted have, have been in bloom for three years straight. Goodbye. (The soon to be grieving widow leaves, and Renora brings Kim in to an adjoining cubicle.) I don't understand. The alien. What has he been telling you? Hatil, we know nothing about him, or why he's come here, or why he's spreading lies about the Next Emanation. All I know is, you can't throw away a lifetime of belief because of him. It doesn't make sense. It's going to be all right. Think about your father. He's waiting for you. I'll see you at the transference ritual. (Loria leaves Hatil and goes to Kim's cubicle.) I don't know who you are or where you come from, but you stay away from my husband. (Loria leaves.) A pleasant trip, Hatil. Say hello to Varel and Toyan. I'll see you there in a few years. (The mummy is helped to like back in the cenotaph and the lid is lowered.) Bye, Hatil. I love you. (Loria pushes a button and two glowing rods extend towards Kim. They touch his neck, there's a jolt, and he is very still.) [Bridge] (Whumph!)
