It's what I do, Tom. Nothing personal. One always knows when a woman of good breeding enters the room. Ma cherie, may I request your favourite song so that we may dance before I take you to my private felucca on the wharf and make passionate love to you. Reculez-vous. Give the handsome young woman some room. Tell me, does she have, er, money?
Madame, your loveliness illuminates our dark little cavern. May I have the pleasure of this next dance? You are just jealous because you cannot dance.
