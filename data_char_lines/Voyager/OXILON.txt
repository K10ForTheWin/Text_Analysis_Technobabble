You're free to go now. (He Â lowers the forcefield.) We've determined they aren't hostile. They've been treated for their injuries and asked to leave. If you like. I'm sorry. We've learned from experience to keep to ourselves. That's your choice. [Public area]  Three days isn't nearly enough time for us to dismantle all our equipment. We've only got one ship. There won't be enough room for any of our belongings. Dex, don't provoke him. Thank you for protecting the boy, but I'm afraid your actions might make things worse. Fighting back has never done anything but cause us more trouble. It's kept us alive. Your captain would be willing to do that? And you'd kill us to get them. Even if you're right, it'd take weeks to dig that many tunnels to the surface. As soon as the miners realised what we were doing, they'd attack. If we do what you're suggesting, people are going to be hurt. I agree. But fighting?  We're moving into position for the next one. [Neelix's ship]  They're targeting our shields.  We're grateful for everything you've done.
