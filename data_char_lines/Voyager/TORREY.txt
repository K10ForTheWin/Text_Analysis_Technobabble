Absolutely. I haven't seen a dilithium matrix this far out of alignment since I served aboard a Ferengi garbage scow. I'll fix it myself. How many times have I told you? Engineering is off limits to holograms. Does it look like anyone here is covered with plasma burns? Looks like your auditory subroutines are malfunctioning, again. I'm surprised a matrix as primitive as yours can function at all. Let's get one thing straight. You're not one of my shipmates. You're a tool, like this hyperspanner. And tools can be replaced. So why don't you go back to Sickbay before I start doing a little reprogramming? [Holodeck - sickbay] Ready.
