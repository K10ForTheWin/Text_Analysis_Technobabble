Chellick's people are known throughout the sector for their administrative skills. Before they came here, we were a dying race. Eco-disasters, famine. Intriguing technology. Can we use him to treat patients yet?  (to another man.) You may go. Well. you've obviously had experience with cellular repair. You'll have to discuss that with Chellick. He authorises all communications. It's time for this patient's next injection. No. Why? Cytoglobin also prevents arterial aging. You may go. At the moment. But daily injections increase life expectancy up to forty percent. We prescribe them for all Level Blue patients. This woman is a chief engineer of an irrigation facility which provides water to half the subcontinent. Keeping her healthy contributes to our survival. Can you say the same for the boy on Level Red? If he becomes more valuable to society, his TC will rise, and then he'll receive better treatment. I'm sorry he's sick, but our society is much better off since we began following the Allocator's protocols.  Who do you think you are, prescribing unnecessary medications for my patients? If you believe that, you're incompetent. Or perhaps malfunctioning. What are you talking about? Because our cure rate was higher. Actually, he seems to be learning the system quite well. [Level Red]  Are we having a problem here? I don't think I can. Cytoglobin isn't authorised for Level Red patients. I don't want to break the rules. Then you should be pleased I hold them in such high regard. [Bridge] No, but he has given me insight into some of the intricacies of our system. For example, did you know if I don't request enough resources for Level Blue this month, I won't get what I need next month? Hmm. Perhaps we should have them transferred to Level Blue. Well, Chellick, what do you think? We'd have to transfer you to Level Blue as well. You'd get your cytoglobin. (Two people beam in.)
