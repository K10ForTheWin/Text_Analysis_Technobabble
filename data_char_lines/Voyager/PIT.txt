(Pit starts to drag Kim away by the foot.) You don't? Well, I'll just take you home then. All right? I say he's not. I'm keeping him. (Paris gets a knife to Pit's throat.) Take him. For now. [Paris' hovel] What are you doing? What's that? Let's see it. You should have thought of that before you took him. (Other prisoners grab Kim as Pit slashes at Paris with his knife. Paris fights back.) What the hell do you want? There's no way out. If you've been in the chute, where does it lead? I want his clothes, and I want his shoes! Back off! You won't have to get hurt. (Klaxon.) New prisoner! (Captain Janeway slides down the chute, phaser rifle at the ready.)
