Good day to you, Katie. It must be lonely out there on the sea with only the stars to guide you. Maybe you should think about settling down on dry land. Can I ask you something, Harry? Would you like to hold my hand? Not anymore. Can I ask you something else, Harry? Would you like to kiss me? Well, good morning, boys. Yes. Well, I must admit I'm not quite myself today. Well, this is going to sound very odd but I feel like I just woke up from the strangest dream, and I don't remember going to sleep. Well, I was out with Harry Kim. He chatted me up at the Ox and We talked. What kind of a girl do you think I am? I don't remember. Oh, it was most unpleasant. I was walking around town with nothing but a bell around my neck. Well, somehow I wound up in church. Everyone was staring at me. You were there, Seamus, and you too, Milo. The next thing I knew, I was tending my flowers just as you boys walked up. Well, what about that Neelix fellow who runs the Ox and Lamb? Well, if he doesn't look like a leprechaun I don't know who does. Hello, Harry. Well, I suppose I can forgive and forget. It's not that often you meet a handsome young man from outer space. (Janeway gives Michael a packet.)
Charmed to have met you, Harry.
