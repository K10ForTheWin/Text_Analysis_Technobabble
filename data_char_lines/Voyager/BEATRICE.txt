Nothing. I just made my first sampler. I finished it yesterday. I don't have it anymore. I gave it to Mother. No, I didn't. I gave it to her last night. I talked to her! She's not dead! I saw her last night! (Beatrice vanishes.)
Hello, Father. I want my tea in this cup, please. And I don't want a cucumber sandwich. I don't like the way Cook cuts them. I don't know what she means. I'm sorry. It's the flower cup, Mother's cup. My mother is alive, and my father loves her, not you. (Janeway covers her eyes. When she looks again, Beatrice is gone.) [Engineering] What's about my mother's grave? There's no one inside. The coffin is empty.
