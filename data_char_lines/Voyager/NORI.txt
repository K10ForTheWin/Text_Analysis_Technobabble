My husband, is he all right? No, you must save him! Tieran. He can't be gone. He can't. [Ready room] We're grateful for your help, Captain. We're complete strangers to you but we owe you our lives. I know your medical staff did everything they could, and Kes has been so kind and compassionate that I don't think I could be making it through this time without her.  The Autarch might have taken a personal interest in our welfare.  They're right outside the door. What's wrong? Does your head hurt? Adin should take a look. Loyalty and service. (Later, the bodies of the guards are being dragged away, and Kes has changed into a skin-tight leather catsuit. She is issuing orders to Resh.) I'm happy that we've accomplished our goal, but there have been some unexpected changes and I don't know how they'll affect our future together. I don't even know if I'm still your wife. I'm told that the Viceroy of Genarr is ready to give you his support in exchange for more territory. Tieran? Who is he? Are you all right? An attack on the Autarch is punishable by death. You know I love you. Soon. A garden? Tieran, please, they're coming.  Don't give in. Stay with me. Tieran! Fight it. You must fight it, Tieran. Please, keep fighting. (Janeway, Neelix and Chakotay are behind a pillar.) We've got to get out, find a doctor and get you stabilised or transferred to a new host. You will survive.
