Leave orbit of this planet now. I know exactly who you are. You are the person responsible for the destruction of one of our freighters and the deaths of nine Malon citizens. I'm taking your probe as compensation for our losses. My people are expert at salvage operations. Vrelk. Controller Vrelk. You are making a serious error. That was rude, wasn't it, but we still have quite a bit of antimatter waste to expel. I hope we didn't damage your shields, Mmm. Well, we only ejected a small amount of waste this time. We still have much, much more to get rid of. Your shields may not be able to stand even higher levels of theta radiation. Let's stop playing these games, Captain. You've scanned my ship, I've scanned yours. We each know the other is building a vessel to retrieve the probe. What you don't know is that my vessel will be ready to launch in less than two days. You're too far behind. Just trying to save you the embarrassment of losing. (Transmission ends.)
