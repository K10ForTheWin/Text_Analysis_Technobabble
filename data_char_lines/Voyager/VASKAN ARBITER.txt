Do you have any evidence to support your explanation? Can this be done? Was there a conspiracy? Did Voyager really help my ancestors to start the Great War? Or were Kyrians the aggressors as my people have always believed? Now, this casts doubt on everything. Today's problems are not at issue here. This is about history. That's not your decision to make. I'm sorry you see it that way. I think we are obligated to hear what the Doctor has to say. Proceed with your investigation.
