Then our philosophies are in agreement. Will you help us? I'm asking you to intimidate the Kyrians with your technology. Help me capture their leader. This ship has superior firepower. He won't risk a conflict with you. A way home. Your reputation in this quadrant precedes you. That's why we sought you out. There's a cyclic wormhole five days journey from here. We know where it is, and we can help you stabilise it. How far do you have to go? Sixty thousand light years? You'll have it within the hour. [Pseudo Bridge] What do you suggest? Our conflict is with Tedran himself, not his people. They're innocent. Captain Captain, don't you think that's excessive? I want them defeated but, but this is genocide! This wasn't our agreement. Then we agree. In exchange, we'll provide you with as much dilithium as you need. I'll transport the canisters immediately. It would be in your best interest to make this exchange quickly. We've been conflict with a neighbouring species, the Kyrians. They've been threatening to attack us. War could break out any day. We've tried every diplomatic option, but the Kyrians are a violent, stubborn people. I wish I could make you one of our diplomats. You might have better luck resolving this situation. The Kyrians. I'd advise you to retreat, Captain. How typical of the Kyrians. They fight the same way they live. Deviously. (Daleth has a weapon. They see Tedran and Seven at the end of the corridor.) Your crew is heroic, Captain.  Tedran, this is between us. Leave these people out of it. We wouldn't need help if we wanted to destroy you.
