You know what I'm here for. I'm Steth. Look at me. You did wear this body for nearly a year before you switched it with mine. That's my body you're in now. I want it back.  The coaxial drive will be online in a few minutes. The alien seems capable of some sort of selective DNA exchange. He absorbs new DNA while depositing his current genetic material into his victims. Let's hope he can reverse that process. Has he detected us yet? (Whumph!)  He's right. We can't risk killing him. Shields are down.  He's charging the coaxial drive. I can't. He's blocking us. We won't be able to follow him once he goes into coaxial warp. We're losing him.
