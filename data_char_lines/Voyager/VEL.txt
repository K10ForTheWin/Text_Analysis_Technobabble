I'm the captain of this vessel. What do you want? Quiet. (to Janeway) This is a cargo vessel. Not if they don't mind having their throats cut. You have no right to hold us. We don't have to answer any of their questions, Piri. She's not my friend. She's my sister. And our political views are none of your business. Let my sister go. She didn't have anything to do with the bombing and she's only fourteen. Quiet, Piri. Please, you don't know what you're saying. Nobody ever gets out of prison on Akritiri. They'll just let her rot in there for the rest of her life. Piri, don't. My sister has quite a vivid imagination. What's wrong? the Akritirians didn't agree to your terms? And what makes you so sure? I'll take you to the prison. And I'll get you in. But there are members of Open Sky in there and I want to get them out too. That's not good enough. All right.
