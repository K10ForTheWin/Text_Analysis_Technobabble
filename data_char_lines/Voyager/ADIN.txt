This particular trade route has always been plagued by mercenaries and thieves. I'm sure they wanted to take our ship and hold us for ransom. I'm a very prominent physician and Nori is a cousin of the Autarch. I certainly hope that bringing us home won't take us too far out of your way. When we arrive, I'm sure that the Autarch will want to thank you personally. Don't you worry about using a device that takes apart your molecules and sends them flying through space? I'm so glad you could join us. You're sure this is safe? We're in position over the encampment now. Looks like Resh's assembled the troops right on schedule. Four hundred men just waiting for your orders. I think I've located the brother. According to security logs Demmas was transported to Voyager over an hour ago. Loyalty and service to the new Autarch. That's an entirely different problem. This body isn't accepting your neural pattern very easily. She wasn't a willing host like the others. Your neural pattern may become unstable if you stay in this host. Now that we've got the transfer mechanism in place, I suggest you use it to move into a more compatible body. Consider the risks! There are reports that his fleet are massing behind the fifth moon. We should make a pre-emptive strike. What's wrong? You're not well. You need to get some sleep. She? You can't stay awake for the rest of your life. You were in such a deep sleep I had to use a stimulant to bring you out of it. Your neural stress levels are extremely erratic. This has gone too far. You must transfer out of this body before it destroys you. (Tieran makes blood flow from Adin's eyes.)
