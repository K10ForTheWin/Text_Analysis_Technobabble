Identify yourselves. Commander Nocona. This is our asteroid field. Now you are. All the resources belong to us. What's your interest in them? You should have requested permission before sending in a shuttle. We have a mining operation in progress. Mining charges. I'm sorry. We're on a strict deadline. But I'll conduct a search for your crew. If they need help, we'll provide it. I cannot guarantee your safety if you enter the asteroid field. Stay here. We'll contact you when we find your people. [Dexa's quarters] Then you should have begun the first time we asked. We can't wait any longer. Demolition of the asteroid is going to start whether you're here or not. We don't want to hurt anyone, but our patience has run out. It's not our fault you took apart your other vessels. I'm sure you'll find a home somewhere. Bring him here! You have three days to evacuate. (The aliens leave.) Their home contains more than thirty percent of the field's ore. Without that asteroid, the operation isn't worth the expense. All we want are the minerals. What do you mean, share? The energy they generate isn't compatible with our technology. We have quotas to meet. We don't have time for that.
