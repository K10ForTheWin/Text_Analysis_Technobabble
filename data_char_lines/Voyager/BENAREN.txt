Time for dinner. What's wrong, Kes? We don't have time to play our guessing game right now, Kes. You know how your mother gets when we're late to the table. That's right, and you're my favourite daughter, but don't tell anyone. What's wrong? A starship. I see. So now it's not only the surface you're dreaming about exploring. We can talk about your adventures after dinner. Kes, we're late. I can see the toes! Keep going, Martis. It's a girl. It's a girl.
