If I may say so, it's been my special pleasure to see many new officers like yourself come through these portals. Your parents must be very proud, my boy. You know, on an occasion like this Interested? I was merely going to suggest that your parents might appreciate a memento of your first mission. I do carry a select line of unique artefacts and gem stones indigenous to this region. Why, quite recently, I acquired these Lobi crystals from a very strange creature called a Morn. Warned about Ferengi, were you? Slurs about my people at Starfleet Academy. Here I am, trying to be a cordial host, knowing how much a young officer's parents would appreciate a token of his love on the eve of a dangerous mission, and what do I get for my trouble? Scurrilous insults. Well, somebody's going to hear about this. What's your name, son? You have one, I presume? And who was it at the Academy who warned you about Ferengi? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Or cufflinks for your father. They're not for sale. Now, inform your commanding officer that the Federation Council can expect an official query. Cash or credit? Brighter. That's an exaggeration. We were just about to negotiate the price.
