No. Maintain distance. His ship is damaged. He's injured. Let him bleed. (Does that deep voice sound familiar? It should, because it is Tony Todd.) The way a creature behaves when it is wounded is the key to it's destruction. Maintain distance. His weapons must be weakening. He hasn't come here to hide. He's come to make a final stand. Follow him. (The Beta selects a honking great gun, one that Tyr Anasazi would envy, then puts two white stripes on helmet.) [Caves] (The breathing masks are back on.) Impressive. He counters out pursuit to the final moment. No. Disengage sensors. I want to take him with my own eyes. Follow. I'll draw his attack. Prepare to target his thoracic crest. (Their prey attacks the Hunter. It is a member of Species 8472. It takes constant fire from both their weapons to kill it.) A flawless kill. [Doctor's office] Our prey. Yes. A formidable alien. We captured it two days ago, but it broke free of its restraints, attacked us. Release me. I must continue the hunt. Why? Only one. Damaged. We tracked it across fifty light years. We thought that we had killed the creature, but this prey is unlike any other. It has many lives. Lower the forcefield and I will finish the hunt. Nanoprobes? She's right. Let me resume the hunt, and I will grant your request. I spent six months studying this prey's behaviour. I know how to track him. Let me continue, or I will have the others destroy you. Â (Rumble.) He's trying to barricade himself. He did the same thing to us. My weapon. [Corridor] It can defeat most hostile environments. I once tracked a silicon-based lifeform through the neutronium mantle of a collapsed star. He's here. My knowledge of this prey is superior you yours. The prey will likely attack the man at point. You would not survive. It's blood. The prey is wounded. He's not planning to run. He's waiting. He'll attempt to slip around us, attack from behind. This prey is resilient. He will strike with his dying breath. We must kill him now. Take me to it. Take me to it! What do you mean? Surrender the creature to me and you will not be harmed. We will not be denied our prey. Give us the creature, or your crew will take its place. Give me the prey. I don't think you will. You want me to destroy this creature. I saw it on your face earlier in the medical bay. It's a look I've seen a thousand times. Stand aside. (Another Hirogen weapons hit makes the forcefield fluctuate. 8472 gets through and attacks the Alpha. Seven opens a panel in the wall and works quickly while they fight.)
Who sent this message? Locate the ship receiving it. Intercept. You were pathetic prey. Easily taken. (He pulls Tuvok to his feet, then Seven.)ALPHA: The hunt was not satisfying. I want information. Why do you violate our property? I could snap your puny neck with one twist. Hardly worth taking. Answer me. Why do you use our modules? I took you in a fair hunt. I claim the relics of the chase. (He puts a red mark over Seven's right eye.)ALPHA: Are the others on your ship able to put up more of a fight than you? Good. Strong prey makes for a better hunt. (He marks Tuvok.) They 'are the first of their kind. I will be envied. We'll be there within the hour. Go to stalking mode. Why do you hesitate? I wanted to claim this prey for myself. I won't share prey with the others. These two must be the only relics. Prepare them. [Bridge] Disconnect your link with our module and leave this space. They are my relics. If the rest of my group arrives, you will be taken as well. I'm giving you a chance to run. Don't be foolish. Leave now and save yourselves. They're mine.  Are they prepared? I want to make the first kill. You will verify it. The others can wage the battle. Don't question me again. We do it now. I'm not concerned. Lower the harness. A long, coiled intestine. An interesting trophy. Unusual relics are prized. Yours will make me envied by men and pursued by women. Your insults are as pitiful as your efforts to escape. This one first. I want the female to witness what will happen to her. Their bone structure makes cutting through the back difficult. This will take time. [Bridge] Ready weapons. Signal the others to attack/ [Astrometrics lab]  Full reverse. Increase power to the engine.
This facility belongs to the Hirogen. Leave the area immediately. So are we, and we don't need your assistance. Where's the survivor? Return him, now. But what? You mean you hid while hunters fought and died. It was your responsibility to maintain those systems. No. They're close. Elevated plasma readings in grid two nine five. They're creating a scattering field to mask their ship. You can find them by scanning for polarised EM signatures. (Seven finds the ship.) Prepare for the hunt. Two hunting vessels are better than one. [Ready room] It's time for the kill. We won't be denied our prey.
