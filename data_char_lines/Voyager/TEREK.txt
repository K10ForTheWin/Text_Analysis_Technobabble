And they teach you all these things? How long have you been captain? Ensign? What's that? This is my first deep space assignment. It hasn't gone very well. I hope so. I've trained in shuttles, but nothing like this. Those are Annari warships. Your people are in danger. [Bridge] I've been studying that Starfleet manual you loaned me. Aye, sir. Course? Medical transport one three six. I've entered the new heading. I was about to correct that. Yes, sir. We've been detected. Two Annari vessels are closing on our position. Correction, six Annari vessels. (The Annari shoot at them.) We need you here. Which ship? The cloak is back online. Sir? I don't understand. I would've told you, but What about the mission? Sir, I don't think you No, sir. Not any more. How are we going to get through? Aye, Captain. [Bridge] There are too many of them. Yes, sir. Sir? Aye, sir. They're responding. What are we going to do?
