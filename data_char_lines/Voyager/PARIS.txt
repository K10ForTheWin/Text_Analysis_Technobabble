About what? I'm already doing a job for the Federation. Well then, I guess I'm yours. (Walking through the trees.) You must be good. My father only accepts the best and the brightest. I wouldn't if I were you. I've never seen a Federation starship that could manoeuvre through the plasma storms. You'd like me to lead you to my former colleagues. I was only with the Maquis a few weeks before I was captured, Captain. I don't know where most of their hiding places are. What's so important about this particular Maquis ship? Maybe it's just your Chief of Security who's disappeared. That's right. Chakotay will tell you he left Starfleet on principle, to defend his home colony from the Cardassians. I, on the other hand, was forced to resign. He considered me a mercenary, willing to fight for anyone who'd pay my bar bill. Trouble is, he was right. I have no problem helping you track down my friends in the Maquis, Captain. All I need to know from you is what's in it for me. Ah ha. Observer? Oh hell, I'm the best pilot you could have. The story of my life.  [Shuttlecraft] (Approaching a Cardassian-design space station. It is piloted by a black-haired woman.) Stadi, you're changing my mind about Betazoids. Oh, that wasn't a compliment. Until today I always considered your people warm and sensual. Just not to me. Only when they're in visual range. Bio-neural? (in uniform) Dazzling, aren't they? As bright as a Koladan diamond. Hard to believe you can find them on any planet in the system. You know, there's a shop at the Volnar Colony that sells a dozen assorted shapes for one Cardassian lek. How much are you selling these for? Come on. (Paris leads young Kim away from the bar.) Didn't they warn you about Ferengi at the Academy?  [Sickbay] (Paris and Kim enter. The doctor and a Vulcan nurse are dealing with a patient on a biobed.) Tom Paris, reporting on board. That's me. As a matter of fact, I seem to be observing some kind of problem right now, Doctor. It's a long story, Harry, and I'm tired of telling it. I'm sure someone around here will tell you before long. [Ready room] (A split level room with the higher part by the windows, so little Kathryn can stand there and be eye to eye with her crewmen.) None at all, Captain. Tomato soup. Plain. Hot. Hot, plain, tomato soup. (Paris takes the bowl and goes to sit by Kim. The doctor and Cavit get up and walk away.) There, you see? I told you it wouldn't take long. Was the accident my fault? Yes. Pilot error. But it took me a while to admit it. Oh, fourteen varieties and they can't even get plain tomato soup right. That's right. What's the difference? I lied. I'll tell you the truth, Harry. All I had to do was keep my mouth shut and I was home free. But I couldn't. The ghosts of those three dead officers came to me in the middle of the night and taught me the true meaning of Christmas. So I confessed. Worst mistake I ever made but not my last. After they cashiered me out of Starfleet, I went out looking for a fight and found the Maquis. And on my first assignment, I was caught. Frankly, I think it was tougher on my father than it was on me. Look, I know those guys told you to stay away from me. And you know what? You ought to listen to them. I'm not exactly a good luck charm. Go ahead. I'd guess they were trying to get to one of the M-class planetoids in the Terikof Belt. A plasma storm might not leave any debris. She's dead. Harry, wait for me.  [Sickbay] (Sickbay is on fire and everyone is dead.) They must have been right next to the console when it exploded. (Kim gets asbestos gauntlets and an extinguisher and puts the fire out.)  [Engineering] (Janeway pins her hair back up and enters. Something goes bang.) We lost our nurse too. Well, we may be stuck with you for a while, Doc. Captain? The crew's scattered around this farm, Captain, but they're all accounted for. No reason to be rude. What? Where? Paris to Janeway. (The girl knocks Paris down.)  [Farm] Computer, locate Ensign Kim. Paris to Janeway. It's good to see you too, Chakotay. An examination? Not all of us were. Captain. I'd like to go with you. It doesn't. I'd just, I'd hate to see anything happen to Harry. Why would anyone want to live in a place like this? They're in this one. Harry! Paris to Janeway. They're in one of the tunnels, Captain. I can't see them, but they're up there. We're going after them.  [Ocampa settlement] Go ahead. Understood. I see them. (Torres and Kim are on the next landing, exhausted. The weapons fire makes the staircase rattle.) How could I let down the only friend I've got? Paris to Janeway. We found them, Captain. Voyager, can you get a lock on us now? The others are. Get down! (A weapon hit shakes the shaft, throwing Janeway, Chakotay and Tuvok off balance, and a cloud dust comes out of the hole.) Paris to Janeway. Chakotay, Tuvok, do you read? Voyager, prepare to transport everyone in this group except me. Voyager, make that three to beam up. Lock in on the other comm. badge and energise. (Kes, Kim and Torres are beamed up.)  [Shaft] (Janeway checks on Tuvok.) I'll get Chakotay. (Neelix, Janeway and Tuvok leave the top of the staircase. Another weapons hit dislodges the metal from the rock wall and breaks the joins. Chakotay is hanging on by his fingertips.) I intend to, as soon as I get you up. Yeah? But on the other hand, if I save your butt your life belongs to me. Isn't that some kind of Indian custom? I don't believe you. (Paris gets to Chakotay.) You'd rather die than let me be the one to rescue you? Isn't there some Indian trick where you can turn yourself into a bird and fly us out of here? Yes, ma'am. I'm getting you out of there, Chakotay. Yes, ma'am. We're in position. You asked to see me, Captain. Will you provide a bodyguard for me, Captain? I do? I think I'm going to enjoy this. Me? Er, for the first time in my life I don't know what to say. Oh, he'll know. When we get back. (Paris leaves and Neelix and Kes come running across the Bridge.) Aye, Captain.  <Back to the episode listing < Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Here you are. Not to mention its lousy bedside manner. Er, only two semesters. But Captain (Bang! The ship shakes.) We're being pulled toward the singularity. We're moving forward again. Captain, according to these readings, we've returned to our previous co-ordinates. This isn't another singularity. It's the same one. They can't both be right. We're either still at the singularity or we're not. Warp engines holding steady. All systems report normal. No. We're still steady on three one zero mark two one five. It's the Voyager. It's us. (Everyone stares at the viewscreen.) Sensors confirm it's definitely USS Voyager. Wait a minute. Wait. Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. We were cruising along at warp seven, then we pick up a distress call and moved in to investigate. But now you're saying that the other ship is actually just a reflection of us and that the distress call is actually just the Captain's opening hail. But we picked up the distress call before she sent the hail. How could we have been seeing a reflection of something we hadn't even done yet? Am I making any sense here? Scanning the singularity. I'm picking up something. A slight irregularity. It could be a rupture in the event horizon. It is a rupture, Captain. It's fifteen metres by ten metres. Captain, if we get too close to the rupture our warp engines might make it collapse even further. You'll need the best pilot you've got in that shuttle, Captain. That'll be me. They'll have to widen it twice that much before Voyager can make it through. (Bang! Voyage starts shaking again.) Aye, sir. [Shuttlecraft] (The shuttlecraft is returning to two Voyagers, one coming towards them and one facing away.) I'm losing power to the port impulse engine. Sometimes you just have to punch your way through. I'll have to remember that one. Oh, it's all right. It's just a scratch, really. You know, I like you better this way. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Holding course three five one mark one zero, warp seven. We'll be passing a red dwarf system in forty minutes. I can't tell you if there are any M-class planets. (Paris goes over to Harry Kim.) You ready? Harry, I can't do this alone. You're making a big mistake. Can't you see what's going to happen? We're the only humans out here, Harry. People are going to start pairing off, and if we don't get to the Delany sisters in Stellar Cartography soon, somebody else will. So what? I've got five. Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry. You really think she's going to wait for you? Let her go. Let her have a husband and kids and a good life, while you and I have the Delany sisters. You need to run a self-diagnostic. Look, they come as a pair. It's a double date or no date. Come on. I told them all about you. Well, for one thing, how you broke the single pilot speed record at the Academy. And who are they going to check it with? (Something hits Voyager, starting it shaking. Janeway and Neelix stagger in from the Briefing room.) I'm not sure. Scanners are picking up a debris cloud in the red dwarf system we're approaching. Aye, Captain. (A short while later, Kes has dressed and enters the Bridge.) Entering the system Captain. Heading zero one zero mark four. Deflectors at maximum. The origin of the shockwave is an M-class planet, Captain. We're within visual range. None. But the polaric radiation may be interfering with the scanners. If that's what happened, the people here never had a chance. I wonder who won? Look. This may be some kind of time piece, stopped at the moment of the explosion. (Sunlight and children's voices. Then it is gone.) What was that? Didn't you hear that? Kids playing. They were as close to me as (Paris is in the sunshine again. Children are playing ball as men and women go about their business. He is in front of a clock shop. A hand touches his shoulder and he is back in the gloom again. It was Janeway.) I don't understand. I was here in this square, but there were people. But I saw them! Lots of people, children playing, and the sun was shining. There was no evidence of an explosion. Everyone was alive and happy. No problem. Er, this is a little more formal than most. You know how it is when you travel. I wish I could say it will be. (He goes to the shop display where the timepiece is counting. 371-20-01 The owner comes out.) Maybe you could help me. I'm from Kalto Province. I'm not used to your timepieces. Are you sure? What do these numbers stand for? A fair price. I might stop back later, if there's time. (Paris rejoins Janeway.) If I understood correctly, this world is going to be destroyed sometime tomorrow. First officers log, supplemental. There's been no sign of Captain Janeway or Lieutenant Paris since they were lost in a subspace fracture.  [Briefing Room] (Kim has got a diagram up on the wall screen.) Maybe there's some way that Even if the natural course of events is annihilation? My father used to talk at length to us about the Prime Directive, once a year, like a holiday sermon. To be honest, I tuned out most of his sermons years ago. The consequences would have to be better than mass destruction. We ate him, because we are demons and we eat children and I haven't had my supper yet. (The boy runs off.) Sorry. I just figured it was the quickest way. The same subspace fractures that brought us here might still be around. If they were caused by a polaric explosion? Is there any way we could use polaric energy to get us back? I wonder where these conduits get their power? [Outside the Power Plant] (Guards are holding back angry demonstrators with physical violence.) Under normal circumstances I'd say we should come back tomorrow. (The young boy has followed them and is watching from the bushes. The guards fire rounds into the air to disperse the crowd. Friends help the injured limp away. One over-enthusiastic guard hits Janeway in the face, knocking her down, so Paris hits him. A demonstrator helps Janeway up, and he leaves with her and Paris.) [Engineering] (Kim switches on a projector that emits a green beam which creates a mini-wormhole a couple of metres ahead.) I was just thinking the very same thing. Infiltrate? You were there when she got this. We don't even know why someone would want to infiltrate you. We were just getting there when we stumbled into you. Thanks, kid. Hey, kid, you were right about one thing. I was lying. I don't eat children What is he, some kind of journalist? Is that right? What's your name? Latika. I'm sorry. I just am. We weren't allowed to tell. At least, I thought we weren't. How did we do that? What? Four oh one twenty two eighty four. Wait a minute. You're saying we're responsible for an explosion even though it occurred before our ship arrived here. Let's say we never came, and their plans didn't change. Wouldn't the accident simply have occurred next week instead of today? Don't waste time with me, Captain. Got to stop them. Sure he will, the kid and I, we're old friends now, aren't we? We'll be here. (Janeway follows Makull, Terla and their helper down the circular corridors to where they are working on a control panel.) [Ruined corridor] (The away team beam into the same corridor after the explosion.) Let her go. Let her have a husband and kids and a good life, while you and I have the Delany sisters. You need to run a self-diagnostic. Look, they come as a pair. It's a double date or no date. Come on. I told them all about you. Well, for one thing, how you broke the single pilot speed record at the Academy. And who are they going to check it with? Come on. Come on. Just go.
No, I'm afraid they didn't. We don't have one. Right. (Paris leaves.) What are you doing? I thought you just said we can't replicate his lungs. Holographic lungs? But a hologram is just a projection of light held in a magnetic containment field. There's no real matter involved. (The EMH slaps Paris.) Kes, I know it sounds pretty grim, but it's better than losing him completely. This way, he'll still be alive, and maybe we can find a better solution somewhere down the road. What do you think Neelix would want? Okay. The isotropic restraint is activated. He won't be able to move more than two microns in any direction. His cellular toxicity is rising. Eight two percent. Eighty six percent. It's offline. Ninety percent. Ninety five percent. (Neelix takes a breath.) Toxicity returning to normal. Captain's log, supplemental. We are pursuing the alien ship from the moon. They are not responding to hails and it appears that our two ships are evenly matched for speed. [Sickbay] I'm on my way, Captain. You know where I am if you need me. It's entered the asteroid, Captain. I think I've located where the alien ship entered. There's an open crater on the limb of the asteroid. The ion trail from the alien ship leads directly inside. Two hundred metres in diameter. Aye, Captain. Captain, I'm reducing power to the aft thrusters only. This passageway is getting a little too narrow for my taste. Thanks, Captain. I'm still picking up the alien's ion trail. Maybe we should follow that. Aye, Captain.
And I'm sure the gastrointestinal problems will go away as soon as our systems get used to his, er, gourmet touch. Ensigns don't invite captains to sit down. Because they don't. Captains don't want courtesy, they want respect. That's why they don't get chummy with the lower ranks. If she wants to sit with us, she'll ask us to join her. That's the way it's done. Captain. We're approaching the perimeter of the nebula. I'm showing mostly hydrogen, helium and hydroxyl radicals. Some local dust nodules. I don't see them giving us any trouble. Density has increased to forty two percent. Not sure. We seem to be drawing some interstellar dust toward us. Density still increasing. Up by seventy percent now. We're at a dead stop now. [Engineering] Acknowledged. Engaging thrusters. (They push through the barrier.) Captain, the breach we just make when we penetrated the field? It just closed behind us. [Mess Hall] Reversing course. We're not penetrating the energy barrier this time. I'll be riding the tail of our torpedo, Captain. I'm having trouble navigating through the energy currents. It's as thick as a Toarian ice storm out there. Dark enough for you? Get up, Harry. Something you've got to see. You'd be surprised the things you learn in prison. [Corridor] You could've changed roommates. Ah. Harry, in order to be reminded of something, you have to first Right. Nothing that's going to compare to that memory of your mother's womb. Computer, activate holodeck programme Paris three.  [Sandrine's] (A ship's horn sounds as they enter the holodeck, and a bell tolls. Nearby an accordion plays and a laughing alien walks out of a bar. Paris and Kim enter to the popular acclaim of a group at a pool table.) What do you think, Harry? This is where I spent most of my second semester at the Academy. I chose the Starfleet base outside of Marseilles for my physical training. I always had a thing about the French. Sandrine, this is my friend Harry Kim. Sandrine owns the place. It's been in her family over six hundred years. (A brunette speaks.) This is Ricky. I include her in all my holoprograms. French father, Daliwakan mother. I wouldn't have it any other way. Harry, this is France. Er, break open a bottle of that '46 Saint Emilion you save behind the bar for me. Harry, it's holographic wine. It doesn't give you acid. Try to get in the mood, huh? I learned a great deal that semester at the Academy, most of it right here. I found this place just after my pocket was picked walking by the harbour. Oh, they just do it for tourists. They give it back. Most of the time. You see that pool table, Harry? The table at Sandrine's at Marseilles has attracted the world's greatest hustlers throughout the centuries. I thought it might be fun to programme in some of the great players to shoot with. Gaunt Gary, Ames Pool Hall, New York City, 1953. They say that he hustled the great Willie Mosconi himself. Oh, he's not ready for you yet, Gary. Let me teach him a few tricks first. I'm not sure. Some old kind of Scandinavian currency. Come on. I'll rack them up, you pick out a cue. Harry, this is my idea of home. My little piece of Earth out here in the Delta Quadrant. What? Your shot, Harry. [Doctor's office] (Torres has put a sample into a centrifuge in Engineering and found the results interesting.) Er, Captain? (The EMH is waving his arms.) Approaching the perimeter. Impulse engines offline. Thrusters engaged. Density is already more than double what we encountered last time. Ambient density is dropping. I can see it. Coming about forty degrees. (Thump!) Field processors coming back on-line. Inertial damping restored. Approximately seventy thousand kilometres from our former position. Deeper inside the creature than before. Yes, ma'am. No engines? We could get in one of those currents and surf back. Aye, Captain. We're on our way. Speed, all of two hundred KPH. (Neelix enters with a tray.) No. Captain? Aye, Captain. And how are we supposed to get the ship into the wound without getting the hell beat out of us again? That's sort of like asking a hurt dog not to bite you while you tend to its wounds. Yes, ma'am. I always had a dog. I'd feel better if I had twenty. Ten sounds good. Just tell me when. Forty thousand kilometres to the perimeter. Thirty thousand. We've cleared the central mass. Captain's Log, supplemental. We set out to augment our energy reserves and wound up depleting them by over twenty percent. As a result, we've set a new course for a planet fourteen light years away that Neelix says might have compatible energy sources to offer us. It is out of our way, but circumstances offer few alternatives. So much for raising spirits. [Turbolift] Easy, honey. I'm setting the Indian up for the big hustle. Yeah, that's exactly what he's supposed to think, too. (Janeway and Kim enter.) Er, yeah. It's just a little diversion, Captain. I'm sorry. If I had some kind of warning that you were coming Yeah. Why? Er, pool.
Aye, Captain. And may I suggest, if this works, we petition the Federation Astronomical Committee to officially designate this the Harry Kim Wormhole. (Later.) Captain, we're approaching the coordinates of the wormhole. Sensors also indicate it's there. I guess it's a little too small for us to fly through. It doesn't look like any wormhole I've ever studied. Does that mean we can't send a message through it? Captain, I'm getting a distorted energy reading. How will we know if the signal reaches somebody? I'm getting it too. A subspace signal relayed through the probe. Why would he pretend to be a cargo captain. Okay, we've got the communications frequency locked in. How can we do that? We'd be going back to a time when you were only two years old.
Shoes. Muddy shoes. (through a door) The dog. (There are alien symbols at the bottom. A thunderstorm rages outside.) Hey, Tuvok, I know it's a little late to ask, but you're sure you've got the logic of this thing worked out?
Aye, Captain. (Zoom) Paris to Janeway. I've brought us out of warp. We're point six light years from the ring system. [Engineering]
Well, we did take that trip to Venice with them. Yeah, you know, I've been meaning to ask you. What happened when you and Jenny Delaney disappeared in that gondola? I think maybe Harry wasn't quite prepared for how voracious Jenny Delaney can be. (And at another table.) What fence? Even we think so sometimes. But what do we have to offer? They seem to have everything they need. But it's not above board. The Captain is only going to deal with an official representative. Just tell her everything you know. Let her take it from there. I'll walk you part way. I'm headed for bed. (Paris and Kim leave.) Aye, Captain. There's no response. Thrusters are offline.
Paris to Captain Janeway. Please report to the Bridge. [Bridge] I've also got two Kazon warships on an intercept course less than ten minutes away. Awaiting your instructions, Captain. Yes, ma'am.
Captain  [Engineering]
Our new heading is one twenty one mark six. We've completely come about, Captain, but it wasn't me. I'm telling you, it wasn't me, and the helm controls are working perfectly. No sign of a malfunction. Aye, Captain. [Sickbay] (Torres holds a carved stone to Chakotay's head then places it on a skin held in a frame. The skin is painted with an eight pointed star and various Mesoamerican pictograms. The stone sticks.) I've checked every ODN junction in the helm control network, and I still can't find the problem. That's not true. I passed by the navigational control on my way back from the Jefferies tube, but that's all. Am I being accused of something here? I'm telling you, I didn't do it. All right. What I wouldn't give to see good old Doc Brown right now. Doc Brown. Lollipops in the waiting room, no holocomic books more than six months old, house calls. I caught a bad cold one time when I was nine years old. The doctor whipped up a pot of garlic soup and brought it over himself. (Tuvok enters.) I guess you're going to have to round up another suspect, Tuvok. That's impossible. To be honest, I don't know what to think. Another brain wave? Whose? That's true. So far it's only affected organic beings. If it could control the computer and navigational systems directly, it probably would've done it already. I feel better already. The most thorough scanning device we have on board is a magneton scanner. We could search the ship centimetre by centimetre, but that wouldn't do much good. This alien could be anywhere at any time. That should do it, Captain. Right. Captain, I've finished the bioanalysis the doctor was running on Kes before he was deactivated. I think he was on to something. If I'm interpreting his data correctly, the bruises on Kes's neck and shoulders were the result of a Vulcan neck pinch. I don't get it. If the alien's in Tuvok, how could it be down in Engineering at the same time? Two? Shields are holding, but they won't last long at this rate, and the electromagnetic radiation is blinding our sensors. I can't find a way out. Yes, ma'am. Or a map. The stones are in the same position as those three planetoids. Chakotay must be using them to point a way out.
They're the ones with the guns, remember? Agreed. But I don't want to do anything until we find out what they've done with B'Elanna. In the meantime, we have to keep track of the guards movements. How long are their shifts, when do they eat, when do they sleep? We'll find an opening, Pete, and when the time is right we'll make our move. (Someone in the upper bunk laughs.) Something funny, friend? Really. How's that? Seems like you know this place pretty well. Then tell me something. I thought those Vidiians were in the business of harvesting organs. How come we're all still in one piece? Thanks for the advice. Listen. When they grabbed us there was a woman with us. B'Elanna Torres. Any idea what might have happened to her? B'Elanna? B'Elanna, what have they done to you? Yes, they stunned all of us. It doesn't seem possible, but you look human. Considering what they've done to you, I'm not surprised. What? When I was a kid, I wore a cap to cover the haircuts my father used to make me get first day of every summer. Looks like you finally got what you wanted. [Tunnels] They're coming to take us to the work detail. You can't let them see how sick you are. Or maybe they'll skip the preliminaries and take you straight to organ processing. I'm the senior officer here. If your superiors want to talk with one of us, it should be me. He's not going anywhere without me. What is it? [Bridge] Here, B'Elanna. Sit down. Thanks. What do you mean? No one could blame you for that. B'Elanna, I'm no doctor, but I have to believe that what ever they did to you has seriously depleted your strength. There's nothing you could have done. Sometimes fear can be a good thing. Keeps you from taking unnecessary chances. Courage doesn't mean that you don't have fear. It means that you've learnt to overcome it. And I know that you can find the courage to hold on until we can find a way out of this place. She's ill. She needed a rest. Tell me how to get there. (A Vidiian puts his hand on Paris' shoulder.) Keep your hands off me! Chakotay? I think they've been taken to what the Vidiians call organ processing.
it's a defensive strategy. Since you can't make a shot, the idea is to leave the cue ball somewhere on the table where Tuvok can't make a shot either. This I have to see. (The cue ball hits the rear bumper and drops into the pocket.) You were afraid.
Propulsion is down. Nacelle controls deactivated. Ready to go. I don't know about the bacteria, but I'm about ready to pass out. I'll try.
What? What are you talking about? Help this man. Look, are you going to help this man or not? Who the hell are you? What are you (Paris disappears.) Doctor, are you listening to me? That man needs help! (That man is the EMH on a biobed, with bad burns and Janeway's voice.)
Aye, Captain. [Shuttlecraft] (Kar wakes to find his hands tied behind his back.) So what are we saying here? That someone blew up Chakotay's shuttle and then took off? Laying in a course. On screen. Open a channel. I'm Lieutenant Tom Paris of the Starship Voyager. I'm in command right now, so you can speak to me. Just stopped to make a few repairs. We'll be on our way in no time. Now, how would you know about that? Under what circumstances? Thanks for the advice. Neelix. We'll leave as soon as we've retrieved our crewmen, all of them, including Chakotay, if he's alive. And if one of your people is with him, he'll be returned to you. (Transmission ends.) I need communication with the surface, B'Elanna, and soon. I've already run a soil analysis. The surface won't support a landing. Stand by for us to beam you out of there.
Hey. Watch it, will you? I'm trying to set up a shot here. Who the hell are you? Sure. We were at the Academy together, right? Oh. Well, it must have been the Exeter. We served on the Exeter together? Ah, Voyager. Well, sorry to disappoint you, but I never set foot on that ship. And I can't say that I'm sorry, considering what happened to it. Oh, yeah. Captain Janeway asked if I'd help her track down that Maquis ship in exchange for an early release from the penal colony. What? Are you kidding? I said yes! It sounded better than Starfleet Rehab. Anyway, I got as far as Deep Space Nine, where I got into a bar fight with a Ferengi, and I was thrown into the brig by a very unpleasant shapeshifter. Janeway tried to get me released but my parole was revoked by Starfleet Command. Voyager left without me. Yeah. How do you know about that? You're right. That does sound crazy. What is it you want? (laughing) You had me there for a minute. You really did. But then you blew it. You're not getting me to set foot inside Starfleet Headquarters. So you tell whatever admiral or captain who sent you that I'm not interested in being another pawn in one of their games. Oh, it isn't? Oh, that's a shame. I like games. You know, you're starting to annoy me. What do you see, Ensign? Excuse me. (Paris punches the security guard. Very hard.) Ow! There goes my bank shot. (Paris takes the phaser.) Helping out a friend. Let's go. (The crowd do not stop them.) [Alleyway] I still have a few friends at Starfleet. They told me you were in some serious trouble. I know the feeling. Those security anklets really chafe, don't they? Let's just say it's been a long time since anybody gave a damn about my future, including me. I don't know if I'm supposed to be on Voyager like you've told me, but it sounds a whole lot better than the life I have here. I'm willing to take my chances, Ensign. Won't be long before they find us. We better keep moving. Sounds to me like you need a pilot. I know someone who used to be pretty good. And if I'm not mistaken, he still knows a few tricks. Site-to-site transporter. With friends like mine, you never know when it'll come in handy. Where's your office? I can beam us in. But we'll only have a few minutes before Security starts kicking down the door.  So, Harry, once we're on board the runabout, what's the plan? Might? Security's just been alerted to an unauthorised transport in the building. It'll take them another twenty seconds to track it to this office. How are you coming? They're onto us. We've got to go. Now! (One of the security officers fires his phaser. They duck behind the drafting board and there is a transporter sound.)  [Runabout Yellowstone] Let's get those engines going. Space doors closing. Releasing docking clamps. Moorings clear. Here we go. (Paris does the traditional ninety degree roll to get through the gap in the space doors.) We're clear. Adjusting course to match. Going to full impulse. I'll try to lose them, Harry, but they're a lot faster than we are. They're closing to five thousand kilometres. (Bang!) I thought you said this ship was new and improved. We're approaching the coordinates of the time stream. The ship's closing to three thousand kilometres. So? We could vent the warp plasma. The second they hit the plasma cloud, their engines would stall. Give us a few seconds of breathing room. Unlocking the warp drive manifold. Any second. They've dropped to one tenth impulse. Our containment field's at critical. We'd better hurry. You think? Increasing speed to one hundred and forty thousand kph. Approaching coordinates. Impact in four, three, two. We passed through the coordinates, but the runabout was unaffected. The starship has repowered its engines. They'll be here in under a minute. Are you crazy? I've locked onto the time stream. Get on the transporter pad. There's no time. That ship'll be here in another thirty seconds. Look. If you're right, then things will be changed back to the way they're supposed to be, and you'll find me back on Voyager. Go! (Paris pushes Kim onto the transporter pad and activates it. Yellowstone goes KaBOOM!) [Shuttlecraft Drake] JANEWAY The hull is starting to buckle under the stress. He won't survive much longer. Ten seconds to hull breach. Hull breach in progress. Welcome back. Kind of a rough ride, huh? What is it, Harry?
Inertial dampers have failed. Did you verify the control inputs? Plasma injectors. Field coils responding. Inertial dampers back online. As your flight instructor, it's my duty to prepare you for anything, fair or not. Yes, well, I'm famous for my dirty tricks, you know? (Whumph! Kes is flung into Paris' arms.) I never said the simulation was finished. Oh, ho! Sounds like a challenge to me. (Neelix watches them walk away laughing.) [Ready Room] (The Captain has dispensed with her bun for a short softer hair style.) That was you? I'm impressed. Play something for me. Oh, come on. Play something. Just pretend I'm not here. (Kim resumes the piece he was practicing.) Play something different. Something not so cheerful. What, you don't take requests? Oh, Harry. I'm in trouble. I think I'm in love. With Kes. I know. I know. I never even saw it coming. I thought we were just good buddies. But there she was in my arms. What? Oh, no. I didn't. I wouldn't. She stumbled during a flight simulation. I caught her. I held her for an instant. Are you going to play or not? (Kim does a few notes.) A whole crew full of women and I have to fall for the one I can't have. Why do I do this to my self? Enjoy it? Hey, don't knock it if you haven't tried it. I just have to be more careful. I can't let myself be alone with her. That's not a Chinese expression. Of course, it would help a little if Kes and I weren't going to be stuck on the same ship for the rest of our lives. I'm in a pessimistic mood. Play something pessimistic. Practice, Harry, practice. (Kim plays a cheerful tune.) [Kes's quarters] (Candle-lit dinner for two.) I think I'll just eat later. (Kes sees him, and waves.) Damn. Very simple. We just won't sit with her. No, that's smart. We'll make it look like we have bridge operations to discuss. Whatever. We just have a lot of bridge operations business to discuss. Yeah. I beg your pardon? Oh, a guy just can't win. Look, there is nothing to fool you about. Really. I swear. What the hell are you doing? (Paris throws Kim's abandoned meal over Neelix. They fight.) It's too late. I'm betting your hair pasta already did the trick. Go ahead. Er, Captain, did you say right away? If we could have It might be too long to go into right now, Captain. Captain, I'm not one to pass up a mission, but in this circumstance, maybe Ensign Baytart who is a fine pilot  Entry sequence at two minutes, mark. All systems normal. Trigemic density at point zero four one and rising. I'm not trying to impress anyone, I'm entering it into the flight record. Look, can I make a suggestion? My suggestion is that we put our personal problems aside until this mission is over. Okay? Fine. Let's get the job done. Entry sequence at three minutes, mark. All systems, stand by. Have you been briefed on shuttle operations? Check your console. I'm reading a power output decline of fifteen percent. We're getting some kind of reaction in our driver coil assembly from the EM anomalies in the atmosphere. I'm going to abort the mission. Hold on. We've lost our impulse drive. Shut off the deuterium flow! I'm dumping excess fuel. Setting DCA pulse over to neutral. Engaging thrusters. I'm trying, Neelix. Prepare for an emergency landing. Send out an EMS pulse. There's still a chance Voyager will pick it up. [Bridge] Sorry. I did the best I could. Any broken bones? I feel it too. We've got atmospheric leakage in the hull. The trigemic vapours really sting. Here. Doc said this would help a little. We can't. We'll have to wait for Voyager to find us. B'Elanna's working on the transporter, and one of those atmospheric windows might open up. In the meantime, we're going to have to look for some kind of cover. The trigemic vapours are going to And we may be waiting here for days. Exposure to these vapours is too dangerous. We're leaving. Grab your gear. An order! You know, it might be more constructive if you could find us something safe to eat. Our emergency rations won't last forever. Oh, don't worry. I've learned to lower my standards since you became cook. I'm picking up some caves about a kilometre west of here.  This is good. We can last a while in here. (They seal the cave entrance with a blast from their phasers.) That should do it. We'd better conserve our beacon cells. (They turn off their torches and heat the rocks with the phasers.) Oh, there's a whole course at the Academy full of all sorts of survival strategies. B minus. My father was teaching the class that year. What about Talaxian protocols? No, more like a bed of Nothing. Neelix, I didn't say that. I never even (They hear a small sound.) I checked for life signs. There weren't any. Whatever this life form is, its vital signs are awfully faint. No, I don't think so. They're faint, but steady. (They see a spacesuit boot print in the dirt.) This is where the life signs are coming from. They're embryonic life forms. These two are half formed. This one almost seems to be (The egg hatches, and the baby reptile starts mewling.) [Bridge]  This creature's going to have the ability to stand upright. It has the skeletal system of a humanoid. It's cold-blooded, has reptilian epidermis. Its brain is significantly larger than most reptilian species. I'd say we're dealing with a sentient life form here, Neelix. It's hard to say. Most common reptiles lay their eggs and never return to protect them. True. And if this thing does have a mother, I'd say we don't want to be around when she gets back. Come on. We're not leaving it here, its mother left it here. We just happened to wander in. We'll leave the door open for her when we go, okay? There's not much we can do about that now, is there? We should just leave all this the way we found it. Neelix! Ours? And you expect to take care of this thing until what? It graduates from high school, college? And what if Mom doesn't come back? Are you planning to bring this with us back on the ship? Fine. Fine. You made your point. I officially designate you its godfather. It's shivering. That's normal, isn't it? I mean, new born life forms do shiver, don't they? Me neither. (Neelix swaddles the baby in his jacket.) It's asleep. Forget what I said, Neelix. You're not its godfather. You're its godmother. [Bridge]  Oh, come on. Come on. It doesn't seem to care for Starfleet rations. Are you serious? Ugh. I hope I never see another leola root. And you're certainly not feeding any of that hideous broth to my niece. Or nephew. Whatever it is. Its heartbeat is getting weaker. I don't like it. Come on, kid. You've got to eat something. Neelix, it's not your jacket. It's the residue of the trigemic vapours we walked through. Think about it. Voyager's sensors picked up high levels of proteins and amino acids, which we assumed meant this was a planet filled with vast supplies of edible plant life. The residue is a concentration of proteins and amino acids. The source we cut off when we blocked the cave. Come on. We've got some rocks to move. [Bridge] It's just too weak. Neelix, we did the best we could. You can't pump it full of drugs without knowing its body chemistry. Give me that. (Paris takes a empty hypo from the emergency kit.) When I was a kid, a baby bird fell out of a nest and landed on the windowsill next to my bed. We had to feed it water with an eyedropper to keep it alive. Filling the eyedropper. Can you hold its mouth open? (Paris blasts the contents of the hypo into baby's mouth.) Life signs are getting stronger. We did it. You know, I never would have thought of that hypospray if. The vapours. Hmm? No, you don't. Well, think of it this way. You saved me from having to eat it. Nothing personal, but I just don't have an affinity for hair in my food. No kidding. What do they say? Neelix, I told you the truth when I said that nothing happened between me and Kes. And I promise you nothing ever will. But you weren't wrong about me. I, well, I guess the only way to say it is to say it. I am attracted to Kes. To be honest, if you weren't around, I'd be knocking at her door. But I respect you, Neelix. And that's that. Everything you heard those guys saying about me, well, it was true. But it's not who I am anymore. At least not who I want to be. This upside down mission to the wrong side of the galaxy has given me a second chance, and I don't intend to blow it. She's devoted to you, you know. Oh, she's a lot more than grateful. She loves you, Neelix. I wouldn't stand a chance. Nobody would. If you ever doubt yourself, just look into her eyes. See the way she looks at you. You'll never doubt yourself again. And as far as I'm concerned, I'll just be her friend. I mean, if you don't mind. Voyager? This is Lieutenant Tom Paris and Mister Neelix. Do you read? Aside from a nasty rash, yes.  No, just young. [Bridge] What? Why? Neelix, one thing's for sure. Whether the mother rejects it or not, she will reject you and me.  If we leave our little hatchling here and the mother rejects it [Bridge] PARIS How long can you give us, Captain? [Bridge] Lock onto us, Voyager. If you hear muffled screams, consider that a request for a beam out. (Paris and Neelix try to hide, but the approaching adult sees them and growls. Then it turns its attention to the baby.) Voyager, two to beam out. I became an uncle. Cold fowl in a bottle? That's just an expression, isn't it?
Friendly fellow. They're in a hurry, too. Closing fast. We have to consider the possibility of cloaked ships. Aye, sir. Initiating evasive pattern beta two. I'm trying. It's my father. Sure am, Captain. I'm running the scans on those ships. Oh, it's not even tempting. [Engineering]  Captain, I'm getting results from the scans. No apparent defensive weaknesses. Metallurgical analysis is inconclusive. Yes, ma'am. Let me say something I've always wanted to say. Get out of my life. Not any more. Not any more. A plasma leak caught me in the face. Help me. Come with me. You can't leave me like this. It hurts. Kes, please. I can't. No. Kes, wait. Come back. Don't leave me! Come back! [Engineering] EMH [on
Go ahead, Commander. Acknowledged. (The beam out is successful.)
I'm picking up sporocystian energy. Aye, Captain. (Zoom.) Captain, we're picking up an artificial structure on long range sensors. It appears to be a space station of some kind. We're approaching the station, Captain. I don't know. It's like the entire molecular structure of the ship is coming apart. Aye, sir. [Mess hall]
Paris here, Captain. Acknowledged. Paris here. Aye, Captain. [Kazon ship] (Culluh is slapping Chakotay around.)
Standing by.
Very polite, these automated units. [Transporter Room] Initiating evasive pattern omega six. Switching evasive pattern to theta one. Propulsion systems are offline. We're dead in the water. For a shuttlecraft, it may be. I don't need a diversion. Just give me a chance, I'll get her out of there. Your concern for my welfare is heartwarming. Yes, ma'am. Er, if I understand you, Tuvok, that would take me into a direct line of fire with the Cravic ship. [Bridge] I'm on it. [Pralor vessel]
We're under attack. By, by, I'm not sure what they are. Checking. We seem to be tethered to some kind of large plant. We're back where we started from, Captain.
Aye, Captain. [Briefing room]
Aye, Captain. [Shuttlecraft Cochrane] Warp nine. Warp nine point nine five. Transwarp engines are stable. So are the nacelle pylons. I'm going to
Why don't we make it interesting this time. Let's add some table stakes. I don't know. Hmm. Couple of replicator rations, maybe? That would be dishonest, Harry. How many rations are you willing to bet on that? Harry, Harry, Harry. Never, ever play with anyone, not even your best friend, if he says let's make it interesting. You want a little action, I'll give you a little action. How about an honest game of chance? One replicator ration is all it takes to play, and the only thing you have to do to win is pick a number. Just predict what the radiogenic particle count will be at twelve hundred hours tomorrow, and if you hit the pot is yours. Minus a small handling fee for the bank, of course. And the winner of sixteen replicator rations in the Paris radiogenic sweepstakes is? Computer? What? No winner? Computer, are you positive? You heard the little lady. Try your luck again, folks. The pot grows daily until we have a winner. Enter your name on the PADD and pick a number. Can I buy you lunch, Mister Kim? I have an extra ration today. I think I'll have some prime rib, medium rare, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and maybe some Yorkshire pudding. And a Raktajino with whipped cream on it. [Ready room] And the winner is? Computer? Computer? Oh come on, Chakotay. We're just having a little fun. The recreational facilities of the Delta Quadrant being what they are. I didn't think Starfleet would have a problem with it. Now there's a tough job, filling out reports. But somebody's got to do it. (Chakotay leaves.)
Paris to Janeway. The missile just took off. It's going into warp.
Come in. Neelix! How's it going? Not good, it looks like. What's wrong? Good news travels fast, I guess. Yeah, I figured there was quite a bit more opportunity for advancement on a Talaxian convoy than there was on the only Starfleet ship in the quadrant. Truthfully? About a minute and a half after I set foot on this ship a year ago. I knew it was a mistake to try to fit into Starfleet again, and I should have listened to myself. A few more months in that rehab colony would have been a hell of a lot better than being here. Neelix, no. This isn't about anybody except me. I've done this to myself, just like always. No matter where I go or who I'm with, I make a mess of things. The unmistakable conclusion has to be that deep down, I don't want any friends, or a family, or a home. Otherwise, I wouldn't keep sabotaging the possibilities. I tried. Or maybe I just told myself I was trying. I'm not sure. Either way, it's just not working. Frankly, I'd like to get out before I completely destroy my image. There might actually be one or two people who still have a good opinion of me. Well, I thank you. But the truth is, I've always considered myself a drifter. You know what that's like, Neelix. Freedom to do what you want, when you want. No rules to follow, nobody depending on you, right? (Neelix hugs Paris.) [Mess hall] EMH [on Hello, Seska. You're looking radiantly maternal. I wouldn't know. It's not sudden. I never really fit in there. No. No, it was me trying very hard to be someone I finally couldn't be. I can assure you the feeling is mutual. Is that why you kidnapped me and dragged me here, so we could be pals now? And if it doesn't? What exactly would that mean? It seems to me like you're already getting a lot of valuable information about Voyager from somewhere. No. Lieutenant Paris is in fact part of our plan. Clever plan, Seska, leading Voyager into an ambush. But even so, this ship will be outmanned and outgunned. Thanks for the hospitality. (Paris runs out into the corridor.) Paris to Voyager. Paris to Voyager! Do you read me yet? Paris to Voyager! [Bridge] PARIS  Captain, change your course immediately. The Kazon have ground troops waiting for you on [Bridge] PARIS I can take care of myself. [Bridge] PARIS I'm here, Captain! Captain, the spy, it's Michael Jonas. [Bridge] PARIS  The shuttle hull is starting to breach. It might not make it, Captain. [Engineering]  And fortunately I was able to steal one of the Kazon shuttles and escape. I'd like to say something more, if I might. Er, I know that I've been acting like a jerk for the last couple of months. Unfortunately, I had to behave that way if the spy was going to believe that I really wanted to leave the ship. So, I'd like to apologise to anyone that I might have offended. Especially Commander Chakotay. I gave him a pretty hard time. Not that it wasn't a certain amount of fun, mind you.
Sorry I'm late, but I have a very good excuse. Picture this. I'm just getting ready to leave the Mess hall, when Ensign Wildman goes into labour. What else could I do but deliver the baby? Oh, you should've been there, Harry. There is nothing like bringing a new life into the world. I think I missed my calling. What if I told you the turbolift got stuck on deck six? It won't happen again. Or maybe it's some kind of trick. Excuse me? Oh, no offence, Commander, but why this sudden concern for my feelings? Yeah, I've got a problem. My problem is you. You tell me I don't take my job seriously. But half the time, you don't let me do my job. It means that you don't trust my judgement. You don't allow me to take initiative. Remember last week? I suggested that we might save time by travelling through that emissions nebula. But what did you say? Oh no, that's not the way we do things on this ship. Being a leader also means knowing when to give your people a little leeway and let them be creative. I might as well put this ship on autopilot for all the freedom you give me to do my job. Yeah, well, I know you don't put much stock in my opinion. So maybe you should talk to some of these people, because I'm not the only one around here who's got a problem with you. Now, if there's nothing else, sir, I'd like to be excused.  Doc. What brings you here? Is somebody sick? Oh. Well, pull up a chair. Oh, thanks a lot, Doc. Why the sudden interest in romance? Ah. All right. Well, let's see. Sometimes there's not a lot you can do to get over a woman you really care about. I remember when Susie Crabtree dumped me back in my first year at the Academy. I broke out in hives. Couldn't get out of bed for a week. I almost failed Stellar Cartography. I walked around in a daze for the rest of that year. Of course, the first one is always the hardest to get over. But, eventually, you start thinking about her less and less. Until finally, without realising it, she's not on your mind anymore. For the most part. But every now and then, even years later, something reminds you of her. A certain smell, a few notes of a song, and suddenly you feel just as bad as the day she told you she never wanted to see you again. If you want to know the honest truth, Doc, you never completely get over a woman you really cared about. Wait a minute, Doc. We're not talking about you, are we? Oh. Boy, you've got it bad. Look, Doc, I don't mean to intrude, but if you tell me what's going on, maybe I can help. [Sickbay] (Denara is sitting on a bed when Kes enters.)  It sounds to me like she might just be shy. I think you scared her off. Your approach is all wrong. Women like romance. They want men to make an effort, take them someplace special. Come with me, Doc. I've got an idea. Doctor's personal log, stardate 49504.3. Inaugural entry. Kes and Mister Paris have conspired to get Denara and me alone together in a place Paris considers romantic. I've never felt more uneasy. [Mars] (The Doctor is sitting in an open topped car overlooking a Martian city, waiting. Finally, Denara appears beside him.)  Sorry I'm late. But it's my shift. What, because I was ten minutes late? Captain. So, when should I report back for duty? Get your hands off me! (Paris pushes Chakotay to the floor.)
This is ridiculous. It's been seven hours. How long does it take to deliver a baby? There's a large plasma drift bearing four zero mark seven. It extends almost half the length of this sector. Interference from the plasma should block us from their sensors.  We're clearing the Vidiian system, Captain. What the hell? Captain, the warp engines just stalled. Impulse engines aren't responding. Manoeuvring thrusters are out too. Are you all right, Captain? It's more than a scratch. Maybe you should go to Right. If it is true, what do we do about it? I'll let the Doctor know he'll have to rely on his back up power supply.  We've got a perimeter alert. A vessel is approaching, bearing zero zero five mark three one eight. They've just dropped out of warp. They're Vidiian, sir. [Voyager 2 - Bridge] (Kim nods.)
I'm not picking up their shuttle on sensors. I'm reading one on heading one five one mark eight. And another one on a divergent course twenty degrees to starboard. We could generate the same kind of field with a shuttle's warp coils. It might be a rough ride, but we can make it. Shields, phasers, inertial dampers, comm. system. Or we could just skip pre-flight altogether. I'll remember that. I've taken the warp drive offline. Setting up the dielectric field. It's holding, but we'll have to keep an eye on the stabiliser integrity. Captain, I'm picking up a Drayan shuttle. They're on an intercept course. The dielectric field is weakening our structural integrity. If we go much faster I'm afraid we'll break up. We're improvising here, the Drayans aren't. We'll be testing that theory in a few seconds. They're about to enter weapons range, Captain. Let's hope the ones on the surface feel the same way. We'll be through this ionosphere in a few more minutes. We should be close enough to get a comm. signal through. Tuvok, can your shuttle make it back to Voyager? Maybe we should wait for you.
Obviously, Ensign Baytart doesn't appreciate music. This ship was built for combat performance, Harry, not musical performance. Nobody figured we'd be taking any long trips. How about the cargo bay? We could get Baytart transferred to the night shift. So now you have an excuse to give your mother why you didn't practice while you were gone. Oh, really? Are we scheduled to rendezvous with the Delta Quadrant Symphony Orchestra? Lieutenant Nicoletti? The one I've been chasing for six months? Cold hands, cold heart? You know, Harry, I've always wanted to learn how to play the drums. [Bridge] Did anyone survive? Maybe they saw it coming and evacuated the planet. Looks like they didn't make it. Maybe they like it in there. How can we do that? Implant a com-link into their brains? Ten minutes and all the hostages could be killed.
Our scans of the planet's surface and atmosphere don't show anything out of the ordinary. Yes, ma'am, but I'd recommend waiting until morning. The weather on the planet can get pretty nasty at night. Here you go. One prize-winning chrysanthemum, one garden-variety clematis, and last but not least, one symbiogenetic alien orchid. We've created a monster. Warp six point five. Commander?
But you're captain now. You can rescind them. Type nine shuttlecraft has a top speed of warp four. It won't take them more than, oh, about seven hundred years to get home. I guess clearly something you can't do, which is to feel as rotten about this as we do. Harry. (Kim leaves, and Ayala takes his place.) I'm reading a second ship, one seven seven mark five. They're surrounding us! Shields down to forty seven percent. Sir, there're just too many of them. They're still coming. Understood. Ready to go to warp, sir. Aye, aye, sir. [Outside the shelter] (Janeway is tending some quite mature seedlings in a vegetable plot. She and Chakotay have stopped wearing their comm. badges.) Aye, Captain.
Negative. Tracking the source. Seems like it's coming from an unmanned buoy, coordinates one four zero mark three one seven. That's good for about forty hours if we average warp two. After that we're out of their comm. range. We'll just do it with mirrors. Aye, Captain. Aye, Captain.  Vessel approaching, coordinates three one four mark two one. Nothing on long range sensors. The raider is continuing to retreat. We should have a couple of hours to ourselves at least. Captain, we're about to go beyond the comm. range of the Talaxian colony. Just thought you'd like to know. Aye, Captain. I'm doing my best. Aye, Captain. Eight minutes. Their attack formation is a classic Cardassian echelon. Aye, Captain. Three minutes, ten seconds, give or take a photon torpedo. Confirmed. They're changing course. Two minutes to intercept.  Here we go. Thirty seconds to intercept. Engaging impulse engines. Initiating evasive manoeuvres, beta sequence. Coming about, one four one mark two zero. Coming about.  Captain, if I can get a shuttle through the cross fire, I can go back and bring the Talaxians to help us.  Computer, repeat stabiliser diagnostic. I just repaired the acceleration sensors. Signature? Damn it! I don't have time for this. (They start shooting at him.) I don't have time for this! Computer, all stop. Engage impulse. (It takes three shots to destroy his attacker.) I told you, I don't have time for this. [Camp] (Night is falling.) Is there any word on the crew? If you can help me with repairs, we can be on our way in a few hours. Commander Paxim, my people are counting on you. Look, no one knows Voyager like I do. I know every vulnerability, every blind spot. Don't worry. I have a plan. One hour. I should be able to come up with some kind of plan in one hour. [Sickbay] (Suder enters through an access panel.) Go ahead. Acknowledged. Ready and waiting. I just hope you are too, Doc. [Planet surface] Here we go. (The shuttlecraft swoops underneath Voyager and fires at its targets.) [Bridge] Yes, Doc, yes! Paris to Commander Paxim. Stand by. I'm going to start transporting your people to Voyager.  I'm sealing off the Bridge manually. I've got to get the computer back online. All Starfleet voice access has been disabled. Forget them. We have more important things to do. [Planet surface] (The chief places a leaf containing other herbs on Wildman's baby's chest. She stops crying.)  Welcome back, Captain. I had a lot of help. The Talaxians, the Doc, Mister Suder. No, he and the Doctor sabotaged the ship. Suder disabled the phasers before they killed him. [Sickbay] (Suder is laid out on a biobed, hands folded on his chest.) Heading four one, mark seven seven. Destination, Alpha Quadrant.
Approaching the last known co-ordinates of the wormhole, Captain. This is where we picked up a replicator signature? He's got a point. We have never heard the Song of the Sages more beautifully recited. Excuse me? No, thank you. We're not planning on settling here. I'm sorry, but we're really not interested. (Chakotay is using his tricorder behind their backs.) Excuse me. Then I'd say the temple's where we ought to look. Look, friend, I thought I told you And let me guess. It just so happens that you could sell us a couple of these ears. And my feet are now cold. Don't push your luck. (They walk away.) You know, so far, I can't say that I like this town very much. (A large gong is struck four times, then the temple door opens and young women in spangly bikinis and thin veils walk out and stand behind two thrones.) On the other hand. (The gong-striker drags out a box covered in a cloth.) But these Ferengi are anything but benevolent. Of course, being Ferengi, they haven't just co-opted the mythology. They've cornered the market on everything. Apparently it wasn't always like that. According to the people that we met, before the Ferengi came, the society may have been primitive, but it was flourishing. What I'd like to know is how two Ferengi got to the Delta Quadrant.  We can't just leave the Ferengi there to continue exploiting those poor people. But how do we get two Ferengi to just walk away from a monopoly on an entire economy? Profit. Looks like Neelix is pulling off quite a performance.  What happened? Oh, great. But we didn't ask you to recite it. Look, friend, I'm sorry about your eye, really, but. Wait a minute. Wasn't your patch on the other side? (The Bard moves his patch from left to right, then holds his hand out.) We've got to go. Did you hear that? The Holy Pilgrim! The Holy Pilgrim! Lead them back! Lead them back! That's our cue. We've got to disable the dampening field so they can beam us out of here. Where's the generator? I can't shut it down. Aye, Captain. They're setting a course for the planet, Captain. Aye, Captain. Resetting the co-ordinates. Adjusting course to follow. It's too fast for us, Captain. I need more speed. It's not enough. Aye, Captain. [Town square] (The crowd watch Voyager zoom across the sky.)
I'm picking up a lot of plasmatic turbulence in there. It might be a bumpy ride.
This one's mine. He's the reason that I'm here. He was my partner in a bombing. We killed forty seven patrollers at Akritiri. Forty seven! And then this scum confessed to the Tribunal and gave them my name. So I'm telling you again, he's mine. Trust me. Around here, you don't want anybody thinking you're soft. I haven't had anything to eat since I got here. Couple of days. Some shore leave, huh? What happened to you after they split us up? That's exactly what happened to me. Then they must have drugged me, because the next thing I knew, I woke up at the bottom of the chute to that welcoming party. Who did you have in mind? Haven't seen anybody like that. The other inmates say this place is three hundred metres underground. Maybe the Akritirians figure guards aren't necessary. (Kim holds out a cup.) What do you think this is, a hotel? There isn't any more! I'm sorry. I'm really starting to get edgy. I think it's the clamp. That's what the prisoners call it. Everybody has one. I'm guessing it's some kind of synaptic stimulator. Anyway, it's affecting my nervous system. I've been getting jumpier ever since I got here, not to mention this thing itches like crazy. Maybe it's some kind of torture device. No! I saw someone try it. It killed him! What we have to do is find a way out of this place. What? Another prisoner, maybe. Join me for dinner? [Akritirian prison] (Brown slabs of something are slid down the chute. There is much scrabbling and stamping on hands to get as much as possible as quickly as possible.) I think I've lost my appetite. Captain's log, stardate 50156.2. After seventy two hours, Lieutenant Paris and Ensign Kim are still missing, and I'm quickly losing patience with the Akritirian authorities. They continue to deny us access to the surface, and they've yet to confirm whether our crewmen were killed in the bombing. [Bridge] You're starting to feel it, aren't you? It gets worse all the time. We have to fight it. Let's focus on something positive. Er, well, I found close to fifty good citizens in this quaint little community, but not a grocer among them. Yeah. But if we ever do get our hands on some food, I found a lovely spot for a picnic. So how about you? Come across anything interesting in your travels? Me too. As far as I can see, the only way to the surface is that chute in the main chamber. That's where this might come in handy. (A piece of metal piping.) I thought if we could get our hands on some loose wiring, you might be able to use it to rig a device that would short out the forcefield long enough for us to get into the tube. Yeah. Now if we could only figure out a way to short out these implants, we'd be all set. [Briefing room] Take it easy. You'll get it. Okay. Okay, concentrate on this. Crown roast of lamb, with a bed of wild rice, and a 2296 Chateau Lafitte Rothschild at the real Sandrine's. Good one. Okay. A couple of barbecued T-bone steaks with baked Risan beans and cherry pie for dessert. Let's see you top that one. Me too. Never thought I'd say that. Are you okay? Just out for a little stroll. (to Kim) Move it! Come on. I'd really recommend that you stay out of my way. Home sweet home. Harry. I'm hurt pretty bad. Promise me something. If things get worse, if it comes down to making a choice, don't worry about me. Take care of yourself. Do we have a deal? Come on. Let's go. This guy's not going to help us. I don't trust that guy, Harry. Just watch your back, okay? Remember our deal? If it comes down to it, you're going to save yourself, right? If you see a chance, just go. Don't come back for me. I'm serious, Harry. Harry. [Akritirian prison] (Kim is working on a panel by the chute, and making sparks fly. Zio appears to be meditating.)  Harry. Er, I was dreaming about Megan Delaney. The chute. You made it in? Did you find a way out? What, what happened to me? Who, who did it? No. No, it was you. No, get away from me! Get away from me! Harry. What's happening to me? Harry? Don't leave me here. Stay back. It's mine! Mine! (They struggle for the pipe. Kim starts banging Paris' head against the wall, then finally raises the pipe to smash it down on him.) You did a terrific job, Neelix. Come on, Harry. We're overdue for that steak dinner. What do you mean, you guess so? It's the thought of that dinner that kept us going. [Corridor]  So, what do you think? Er, baked potato, a big mound of deep fried onion rings. Maybe, maybe, some grilled mushrooms. What are you saying? You're the one that kept me alive. You want to know what I remember? Someone saying, this man is my friend. Nobody touches him. I'll remember that for a long time. So, what do you say we blow a week's worth of replicator rations? Cherry pie. Don't you remember? Ah! Yes. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

All I know is that Neelix has been working on it all afternoon. He wouldn't even let me in there to get a snack. [Mess hall] (The place has been transformed. The tables and chairs are gone, replaced with cushions and drapes.) It's very colourful. It's a little cold in here, isn't it? The Enarans. I got it.
I want to keep looking a while longer, just to be sure. What's wrong? You have a big dinner date or something? Well, you've been angling to get back to Voyager for about two hours now. Just thought maybe there was a reason? Like Ensign Bristow. Oh, I've noticed he's been making any excuse to hang around engineering. Around you. Oh, really. He looks like a grown up to me. Tall, good-looking and I hear he plays a mean set of Pareses Squares. I'm just curious how someone with Klingon blood seems to live the life of a tabern monk. Well, if you ever have a free evening, I have a holodeck programme you might enjoy. Sailing on Lake Como? We must have crossed into a tachyon field. A ship has locked onto our hull. The tachyon field must have disrupted our sensors. I'm Lieutenant Tom Paris.  [Holodeck - Parisian cafe, 1830s] According to my readings it's huge! Yet. Aye sir. Here we go. I'll try holding warp nine point seven five for as long as I can. Captain, something is wrong. It's like there's a drag on the engines. You sneaked out of your house? Where were you going? Can I take a few guesses? Looks like it's been pounded on for days. It was still attached to the freighter's hull. Captain, that little ship is high-tailing it out of here. They're only one hundred thousand kilometres away now. Changing to evasive pattern gamma four.  [Turbolift] They're only seven thousand kilometres away and still coming.
Helm control is offline. I'm trying, Captain, but we seem to be caught in some kind of graviton distortion. We're being pulled in too. (The two ships fall into the rift. After some shaking and a white-out, in which everyone loses consciousness, they awake in normal space.) Home. Captain, they had surveillance satellites during this time. That's right. Simple. Nice clothes, fast car and lots of money. [Los Angeles - beach - Santa Monica] (A guy on a skateboard wearing a massive boombox around his neck knocks over a street vendor's wares. Other people are on motor scooters or stilts. The away team watch from the railing of the upper level.) Let's head up to the board walk. Ah, the sun feels great. Lighten up, Tuvok. This was a great time and place and you're getting to see it first hand. Come on, take off your shirt. Oh, Vulcans. Deep down you're all a bunch of hypochondriacs. (Elsewhere on the beach.) Nobody walks in Los Angeles and they don't have much of a public transportation system. We're going to need some wheels. See you later. [Alleyway - Braxton's home] (The shack has The End of the Future painted on the wall nearby.) Nobody's around, Tuvok. We're fine. We haven't stolen anything. We borrowed a car. And we'll return it to the dealership as soon as we're done. Somehow I doubt that taking a test drive is going to alter the course of the universe. [Griffith Observatory - Rain's laboratory] Tuvok! They've found us all right. The orbital schematic matches Voyager's position. Nobody in this century even knows what warp emission are. I'm sorry, I think we're a little lost. We were on the museum tour and we took a wrong turn at the Saturn exhibit. This lab is er, pretty groovy. What do you do here? For what? My name is Tom Paris, by the way. Your curves don't look so great. This is a Fourier spectral analysis? You know, you might get better resolution if you adjust your amplitude parameters. Or you might try using a theta band filter. I majored in astrophysics. Starfleet Academy. East coast school. (He goes to one of her movie posters.) Orgy of the Walking Dead? That's a classic! Did you see the sequel, Bride of the Corpse? Something like that. Yeah, right. Got to go. Yeah, great, but I think we're busy on Tuesday. Thanks anyway. (They leave.) Good. I hope she doesn't get in any trouble. It's a shame, though. She was about to make the biggest discovery in human history. It could have changed her career. Red alert! Look, I don't have time to explain. Get down! (The borrowed pickup is atomised. Tuvok returns fire.) Do you have a car? That means we can't call the, our friends. What do we do now? I told you, we're secret agents. Look, we saved your life. Isn't it obvious we're on your side? Rain, you're not going to scream! I know you're frightened and you've seen some pretty strange things, but you have to trust me! We're not going to hurt you and I will explain everything. It's either that or take your chances with the guy who tried to vaporise you. It's a Soviet spy satellite. Part of a massive KGB operation. We're trying to stop it. That's what they'd like you to think. He's very sensitive about them. That's exactly what happened. Classified. Rain, you're fantasising. I apologise. Would you also accept that there are lives at stake here? The more you keep asking me questions, the more difficult you make things. For everybody. So, why'd you become an astronomer? I think so. These things are kind of crude. So much for sending a locator signal. The radio dish at the Observatory. We could use the same set up Well? What do you mean? He's heading in the wrong direction. They're not going to the van. We're recalibrating Starling's position. You're going to have to take him out of his own car. Now, Chakotay! [Shuttlecraft] Rain, I'm sorry you got dragged into all this. (The cellphone rings.) I told you, I can't talk about it. Whatever. Not that I can recall. Is that so unusual? I can't. Absolutely not. Just very busy. Saturn. Rain. (The tricorder beeps.) Tachyon emissions. (A big truck is leaving the area.) They're moving the timeship. You wouldn't mind hanging with me for a while longer, huh? [Cellar] POLICE Look out! (Paris grabs the wheel and they swerve, then follow.) Get in behind him. Right off his bumper. Little closer. One more metre! It's flooded. Give it a second. I think so. (The truck is heading back towards them over a crest in the road.) Jump! (They do, then the shuttlecraft arrives and phasers the truck.) [Shuttlecraft] I've never met anyone quite like you, and I don't think I ever will. I will. (Paris kisses Rain goodbye.) [Timeship] Aye, sir. [Timeship] Then what are you doing here? Aye, Captain. Captain's log, stardate 50312.5. We are again in the Delta Quadrant, at the exact time and place we first encountered the timeship. I've resumed a course for Earth and I've ordered the crew to the Mess Hall for a toast. [Mess hall] Hear, hear. You should have seen it when the parking enforcement officer came over to the van. Tuvok tried to use pure Vulcan logic to talk her out of giving us a citation. Of course not! Tuvok, has anyone ever told you you're a real freakosaurus. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Bridge to the Captain. We've located the missing shuttle.
Yes, ma'am. Who says crew performance reports have to be a chore? Now if we could just convince the Captain to start holding morning briefings in here. All right, Q, we'll bite. What do you want? Oh, I'll bet she loved that one. Look, Q, we've been told about your appearances on the Enterprise. We know your little visits usually turn out to be more than meet the eye. So save your broken heart routine, and tell us what you're really after. My advice would be to give up before you embarrass yourself anymore than you already have. Come on, Harry. We're not going to get a straight answer out of this guy. I can't. A subspace shock wave from the star is collapsing the warp field. It's no use, Captain. the shock wave is too fast for us. Warp drive is offline. Sir? We'll be reaching the imploding star in thirteen seconds. I still have time to change course.  Entering the star's corona in three seconds. (to Colonel Q) Put down the gun. (The female Q unties Q.) Captain, what should I do with him? Hold your fire! We're back on our original course.
I volunteered to help out while Neelix is away on the trade mission. The heating array overloaded, it incinerated a twelve kilo pot roast and all the food replicators went offline. Actually, I'm a pretty good cook when Engineering's doing it's job. Well the gel packs are your department, aren't they? Besides, what was I supposed to tell all these hungry, irritable people? Oh, no. You can't leave me now, Lieutenant. B'Elanna! [Sickbay] I thought Klingons didn't get nauseated. You have a redundant stomach. Paris to sickbay. I just saw two macroviruses come out of B'Elanna's neck. What, what is that?
Maybe the theorists were wrong. After all, they never had a chance to look at the real thing. Aye, Captain. No argument here. Right, Tuvok? I've got my hand on the controls. We'll be out of here before it even touches our shields. There she goes. (The strand flares, then vanishes in a big flash.) Aye, Captain. Lieutenant, you look absolutely More along the lines of smashing. Of course, nothing can quite measure up with this shirt. This is an exact recreation of a 1962 Big Daddy-O Surf Special, an American classic. Now that's where you're wrong. Vorik? I thought we were meeting Harry. Why not? With what? Harry and I will meet you and Vorik at the luau. Yes, I am. [Kim's quarters] (Kim is trying to meditate when the doorbell chimes.) Surf's up, Mister Kim. Harry, this is a luau. You look like you're dressed for a funeral. What are you doing? What for? Is something wrong? The resort woman? What was her name? Well, for two days now, every time I look for you it's always, he's in Holodeck one. And since you don't like hydrosailing, I figured something was going on. Tuvok? He told you to do all this? Retreat? A classic case of Vulcan denial, if you ask me. Come on, Harry. We have all fallen for a holodeck character. It happens. You deal with it by staying with your normal routine, not by hiding out in your quarters. Okay. Have fun. Computer, one Hawaiian shirt. Pineapple motif. [Holodeck - Luau] (Full luau mode, with Hawaiian guitar music, leis and grass skirts, and lit tiki torches. Tuvok is in his uniform.) Thanks. (They contain drinks.) Oh, me too. Let's find us a spot. This place is filling up fast. Good memory. Harry? Do you want to get something to eat or not? Harry. Okay. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. (Kim leaves. The evening draws on. Almost everyone has left the holodeck.) Aye, Captain. (Beep.) Captain, propulsion is not responding. Course laid in. I don't understand it, Captain. More to the point, what is she? But what does that have to do with knocking propulsion offline? We're lucky. It's kind of creepy. Ah. You really know how to pick 'em, Tuvok. I'm not reading anything unusual on the holodeck. It seems to be working perfectly. B'Elanna! (A pair of big Polynesians fight Tuvok while a girl knocks down Paris. Tuvok wins, then encounters a forcefield.)
On our way. (Later -) Pleasant fellow. Er, you could say that. No, thank you. Nice place. (Elsewhere, Neelix approaches a slightly more humanoid person.) Oh, you may regret that. Chakotay and I have to pick up a supply of biomimetic gel tomorrow morning, and I am trying to find to find the container that is listed as the proper transport device. Starfleet standard issue L647X7. Sure, anything. That's right. I've thought a lot about that, and it comes down to one simple fact. I didn't tell the truth. I made a mistake, which happens to people, but if I'd admitted that mistake it would have been a lot better. But I lied about it, and it nearly ruined my life. Why do you ask? After I've done here, a bunch of us are going to go down to the resort. Why don't you come along? Okay. [Engineering] What is this? Arrest?
They sure could use it with all the damage they've taken the  past two years.  Impressed?  Yes, ma'am.  Well, as long as we go slow and easy, we'll be fine.  Not more than fifty or sixty years ago. Hardly enough time for  these structures to decay so badly.  Are we in a rush?  Grab your gear, and try to keep up. [Underground] (They  enter down a rope.)  If you mean the fun of wondering whether your anchor will hold  while you're dangling over a cliff, I think I'll pass. See you below.  (Paris abseils down.)  Watch your footing!  No!  (Paris descends rapidly, followed by Torres. She lands heavily on her  feet, whereas Neelix had fallen on his backpack.)  Are you hurt?  Careful. Careful. You might have broken it.  Calm down. This wasn't Neelix's fault. I saw him drive the piton  and it was solid. It must've malfunctioned. You are hurt.  Don't you think you're overreacting a little bit?  He's right. Let's contact the ship.  Ow! B'Elanna! What is wrong with you?  Wait!  The last thing we need is for all three of us to split up. Paris  to Voyager. We've got problems down here.  (A short time later.)  I haven't been able to contact her. She's either out of  communications range  [Bridge] PARIS    Verify is about ten metres below us. I tried to stop her from leaving,  Captain, but she got very hostile and bit me. [Bridge] Life threatening? She could die from this?  And you've gone through it every seven years of your adult life?    Right. Well, it looks like finding her won't be easy. Scanning  range is limited to about twenty metres, and even that's not too  reliable.  B'Elanna.  Yes. It's called a tricorder.  No, it didn't.  (Ishan returns the phaser. Something beeps.)  B'Elanna, don't! B'Elanna!  (The ground shakes. Paris falls, and Torres gets the rifle off her  attacker, who falls to the ground then disappears. Paris and Torres are  alone.)  I'm not picking up anything like that. Or any life signs.  Yeah, that must be it. Or else these aliens are generating some  kind of interference so we can't detect them. We have to get out of  here before they come back.  If you have any ideas how to find them, I'm listening! We have  to get back to the ship and get some help, for them and for you.  I'll try to explain it to you, but we've got to get moving. [Sickbay] It does explain how you've been acting.  How about starting a fight with a group of armed aliens,  shouting at Neelix, giving me this. If I remember my Klingon customs,  biting someone on the face means  When we get back to the ship, the doctor should be able to help.  Or there's always Vorik.  The tremor must've shaken the rocks loose.  Hold it! We don't know how stable this tunnel is. An energy  blast might bring the rest of it down on our heads.  No. I think I should keep this.  (They struggle for the phaser rifle.)  I'm not going to fight with you, B'Elanna.  B'Elanna, stop it! This isn't about the gun. This is about sex.  But that's not gonna happen right now.  No. No. I'm your friend, and I have to watch out for you when  your judgement's been impaired. If you let these instincts take over  now, you'll hate yourself, and me too for taking advantage of you. I  won't do that.  No.  Are you telling me that I'm impossible to resist?  Good. Come on. [Underground  room] (Light  from somewhere above, an artificial hearth, a stone chair and obelisk.)    We're almost to the next passageway. Can you make it?  It's all right. We'll find a way out.  I might agree with you if I still had it. It's buried somewhere  under all that.  Sorry. Try to stay calm. I know it's hard.  Well, I'm making an exception. I can't let you do this.  You're right. I can't.  Oh, believe me, I'd like to, but I know this isn't really you.  You've made it clear that you're not interested, and I have to accept  that's how you feel, even now.  I hope someday you'll say that to me and mean it.  You know that's not true.  Still stuck in the cave, I'm afraid.  No. We're not looking for the gallicite anymore. We're trying to  get back to the ship, remember?  B'Elanna needs help. We've got to get her out of here. [Planet  surface] What's the matter? Why aren't they answering?  B'Elanna, I know this is a pretty bizarre situation, probably  not what either one of us had in mind, but it's too late to worry about  that now.  What?  So this is the part where you throw heavy objects at me?  I'm not sure exactly what I'm supposed to do.  (So he nuzzles her neck and she throws him to the ground.)  Enjoying myself?  You want a fight? You've got one.  They'll tear each other to pieces.  It's over, isn't it?  Deck two. So, looks like you're feeling better. You back on  duty?  Oh, good. Glad to hear it. Computer, halt turbolift. Look, this  is ridiculous. We are going to be together on this ship for a long  time.  But something did happen, B'Elanna.  Yeah, I know. You're afraid that your big, scary Klingon side  might have been showing. Well, I saw it up close, and you know, it  wasn't so terrible. In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing it again someday.  Computer, resume. 
Time loop? She could be in some kind of alternate dimension in subspace.
Now that you mention it, Captain, I find this region of space a real navigational challenge. The Borg. Maybe they're trying to lull us into a false sense of security. Aye, Captain. Well, that's a relief. Yes, Captain. Captain, the Borg ship is powering weapons. What the hell happened back there?
Acknowledged. Paris out.
Ensign. Doctor. Deck ten. So, what are you up to, Doc? Yeah. Never ends, does it? I guess that mobile emitter turned out to be something of a mixed blessing, huh? Okay. Goodnight Doctor, nice chatting with you. (The female Ensign and Paris leave the turbolift and the doors close. [Corridor] EVIL
Harry. Is this the standard welcome home reception? Really? Ah, that looks good. What is it? We'll see you later. [Doctor's office] (Molecular scan 4077, of course.) Aye, Captain. Increasing power. We're clear. Setting a new course. Captain, we've another problem. Three Nasari ships coming straight at us. Less than one minute. Five seconds to intercept. (Voyager sails past the fight.) Anyone would have been drawn in by these Taresians. I have never seen so many beautiful women in my life. I don't see what's so bad about being you. You're good at your job, everybody likes you. Like me? You might want to reconsider that, Harry. There could be prison time involved. Actually, since I've been on Voyager, I've tried to be more like you. I'm serious. You're my role model. You're reliable, hard working, extremely punctual. Did I mention polite?
The Doctor's right. Let him do his work.
That's good. [Shuttlecraft Cochrane] I'm ready. [Shuttlecraft Cochrane] I can't hear you, Captain. There's a lot of plasma interference. I can't clean it up. I can hear you. Is that better? Loud and clear, Captain. [Shuttlecraft Cochrane] Harry was right. [Shuttlecraft Cochrane] Exactly. [Shuttlecraft Cochrane] Captain? This one's turning out [Shuttlecraft Cochrane]
Captain, someone on the alien vessel detected my launch sequence. I don't know how they did it, but I'm completely locked out.
Where are you going? You were doing great. You were in perfect position to deliver the death blow. All you had to do was follow through. Come on, let's try it again. I am not pushing you, I'm encouraging you. Try something new. This martial arts programme is the best work out I've ever had. No, it's more than that. Working with a bat'leth is an art. You have to use your mind and body, your movements Would you watch it? You could take somebody's head off with that thing. Look, if you don't like the programme, that's fine. But why do you always have to get so hostile? Paris to Bridge. We have an alien visitor on deck six. You're on a starship called Voyager. Where were you before? What's wrong? I went over our navigational charts with Dammar, but he's completely unfamiliar with this part of space. For all we know, that colony could be thousands of light years away. Could it have been some kind of spatial anomaly? Exactly. It's more like an idyllic version of Earth. As though it were created specifically for us. The Captain sent me down to get an update. Don't worry about it. Good. I'll tell the Captain. Er, about the programme. I didn't mean to push you. That says it, all right. And what is that supposed to mean? And why is that exactly? That's ridiculous. I am an easy-going person, who is just trying to be friendly to someone who is obviously terrified of having a friend. That's a good question. I think I'll stop wasting my time. (Paris leaves. The EMH presents his emitter for resetting. Elsewhere, Tuvok and Chakotay are working at a table.) B'Elanna, over here. (They open the door to a mountainous rain forest.) No, we've got to find the Captain and Tuvok. They might need our help. We've got to get out of these tunnels. There must be somewhere to hide in one of these habitats. This is the last place they'd want to follow us. Let's hope it's worse for them than it is for us. We don't want to get too far away from the portal. Maybe we should find a place to hide. Here. I would have thought all that hot Klingon blood would have kept you warm. (Paris blows on her hands.) Really? I thought that was Cardassians. Better? B'Elanna! (Torres shoots the Nyrian.) Nice shot. Now let's get out of here before we freeze to death. [Control room] You have to keep moving. No, B'Elanna, get up. If you do that, you'll die. Oh no, I am not going to let you do this. On your feet now, Torres. That's an order. I am a bridge officer, and I have seniority. On your feet, now! Come on, you've been wanting to take a swing at me for days. Now's your chance. You will keep moving. Or do I have to throw you over my shoulder and carry you out? Beautiful. I guess they were. Yeah, it sure does. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.

Shuttlebay to Captain Janeway. The shuttle's ready to go whenever you are.
Better to ride the rapids than face the hive. We've dropped out of warp. Captain. Who could do this to the Borg? (They cruise through the debris field.) Captain, the bioship is powering up, like it's charging some kind of weapon. (Kes is given a view of the alien. She stumbles back into Janeway's arms.) The alien ship is not pursuing. Aye, Captain.  An alliance with the Borg? Yes, ma'am. Commander, there are nine more bioships coming out of the singularity. (Eight of those ships surround a ninth and send energy to it. It then sends a massive energy beam towards a planet.) [Borg Cube] The Cube is altering course. They're heading toward the Alpha Quadrant. They've released their tractor beam. I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but, looks like the Borg are cooperating. [Sickbay] (Kes is working in the medical lab, when she sees a reflection of Species 8472 in the wall monitor. Then one appears, and she curls up into a ball.) Harry. Welcome back. Commander. I'm picking up gravimetric distortions twelve thousand kilometres aft. It's a singularity. [Borg Chamber] They're charging weapons. We're being targeted! Destroyed, and it took the bioship with it. Aye, sir. Class H moon. Oxygen-argon atmosphere. Aye, sir. We're fighting intense gravimetric distortion. I can't break free. We're being pulled in! We've definitely left our galaxy. No stars, no planets. Four bioships have just entered sensor range. They're coming around for another assault. I've lost thrusters. Captain. Aye, Captain. They're in pursuit. Yes, Ma'am. Captain's log, stardate 51003.7. Three days, and no sign of Borg or bioships. We appear to be out of danger, but the entire crew is still on edge and so am I. Not even the calm of Master Da Vinci's workshop is enough to ease my mind. [Da Vinci's Workshop - night] (Janeway is at a desk, writing with quill on parchment.)
The hull is destabilising. The molecular bonds are breaking down. [Corridor] Shuttle distance, one hundred thousand kilometres. Speed, one quarter impulse. (Janeway and Tuvok enter.) We've just dropped out of whatever it was we were in. Nine point five thousand light years from where we just were.
