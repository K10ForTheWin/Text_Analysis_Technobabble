Let me go! No. Tressa. You don't look like us. We came here on a ship, but it crashed like yours. Dead. Is he dead too? What were you doing to him? Why? It's all right. (Another girl and a boy come out of the bushes.) Everyone else died in the crash. We're alone. Will your friend be all right in there? The attendants protected us. The people on our ship. They got us to the escape pod before they crashed. Can't you fix it? Will that take a long time? You don't have to be so mean about it. The Morrok is what takes you when you die. It's here. It'll come. The Morrok took them while we were sleeping, and tonight it will take us. [Sickbay] You think they wandered off and got lost, but they didn't. The Morrok took them. They're gone. You don't understand. We have to get away from here. Please, Tuvok? It makes my stomach all tight. You don't get scared, ever? We promise. (Later, Corin and Tressa are running in and out of the shuttle while Elani stares through a large magnifying glass.) No, I found it! (It is a micro-welder.) Where do Vulcans live? Is it far away? Be quiet. We're trying to attain a meditative state. Tuvok! I hear something. We have to hide, Tuvok. You can't let them find us here. They won't take us home. They're the ones who made us come here. They sent us here to die. If they find us, we'll all die. Please, they're coming. We're supposed to die here. That's what this place is for. The scrolls say we should be happy. That when we die the energy inside us is set free. I know we should have more faith. It's wrong to be afraid of death. We can't sleep. I think the fire's going out. Maybe you should look. Tuvok! Tuvok! They're gone. [Bridge] It was the Morrok. Why don't you believe me? But if you go in there, you won't come out. No, Tuvok, don't leave me all by myself, please. I'm scared. Promise? What did you see in there? I'm going to be next, aren't I? There's nothing we can do about it. I'll really be quiet this time. I won't touch anything. What about the electro. The currents that made the ships crash. You did it! You saved me! Then what are we going to do? I want to stay with you. You want me to die. No. I'm not going back there. I'm staying with Tuvok. No, leave me alone. We weren't alone. Tuvok was here. He stayed with us and made us feel safe. He told us there was no Morrok and that we shouldn't be afraid. He took care of us, even when we didn't behave as well as Vulcan children. Nothing? Tuvok? You said you would protect me. I won't be afraid, not if you're with me. I know it's time. My only regret is leaving my family. My grandson. You remind me of him.
