Torpedoes, plasma grenades, particle beam rifles. I can even get a ceremonial spear if you're interested. My point is, no matter what the weaponry, if you desire it, chances are I have it or I can get it. Unreasonable is such a strong term. But if I can't sell to you, I'll sell to one of the other colonies in your system. A violent sort, your neighbours, aren't they? I'd hate to make your life difficult by offering my weapons to them. But if you don't give me a choice And to you. Enjoying yourself? No? How can I change that? The former's quite likely, but as for the latter, I don't sell inexpensive merchandise. A computer that could coordinate the systems of an entire colony. That's no small order, but I think I might have something that will interest you. Computer, tell us your technical specifications. Interested? I could sell it to you, but I could hardly let it go for anything less than a warship. Or we could find something else in your price range. [Da Vinci's Workshop] So it's captain. I see you and my hologram are old friends. (Tau points a weapon at Janeway, snaps his fingers and holds out his hand. She surrenders her comm. badge.) Or what? You're in no position to bargain. The only ones who will bargain will be your crew and it will cost them a great deal to get their captain back. I wonder what you're worth to them. (da Vinci hits Tau with a brass cylinder.)
