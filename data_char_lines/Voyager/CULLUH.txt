My name is Culluh, First Maje of the Kazon-Nistrim. What have you done to our ship? I would like to speak to the survivor. You will prepare for my arrival. (Transmission ends.) Our sensors show that you are trespassing on our vessel. If you attempt to remove anything from our ship, it will be considered an act of war.
Culluh calling Seska. He's not here.
Understood. Just one other detail. An exchange of crewmembers. Yes. I'm sure you'll agree that our alliance should represent a genuine partnership. It's obvious. Federation crew on my ship, Nistrim crew on yours. It seems a natural extension of your own proposal. I will determine what we decide, and when. I won't have a woman dictate terms to me. (to Tuvok) Talk to her. Tell her to be reasonable. They're calling for a conference of all first Majes. How could this have happened? I could not let the negotiations be dictated by that woman! Watch your tongue. You're not suggesting we go to this conference? That we come running like a Calogan dog when the Federations call? You may be right. Captain. We seem destined to encounter each other. I never thought I'd see the day when any of us would sit at a table with the Trabe. Perhaps. Peace? With the Trabe? Forgive me if I'm a bit sceptical. Excuse me. (Cullah gets up, fetches a jug of drink and sits down again.) Captain Janeway, I'm curious as to the nature of this alliance you've struck with the Trabe. Especially since you refused my offer of a similar pact. What I fear, Captain, is that this union you've made with the Trabe is an effort to force us to capitulate. If so, we assure you, it is doomed to failure. I can't speak for all of you, but I for one don't think we can trust this proposal. A woman and a Trabe. How can we listen to them? I find you nothing but a hypocrite, Captain, allying yourselves to the greatest villains this quadrant has ever known. If this is where your revered Federation values have taken you, I want no part of it. What is this, Captain?
Easily arranged, Captain. I think I can assure you of that, Commander. I intend to take him for my own son. A man who would violate a woman under his own command Doesn't deserve a son. The boy will be trained as a Nistrim askara. Already he has helped us win the greatest battle in our history. You'll be given no more respect than any Kazon woman, now that your ship and technology are mine. I will tell you when you may speak. You're even worse than she is. What is it about the women from your quadrant? You know, she contradicts me in front of the senior askara? My own woman disputing her Maje in front of others. This is your fault. You've let your women get out of control. Why is it so dark in here? Somebody turn on the lights. Order the repair crews to begin work immediately. I want to leave for the Hanon system as soon as possible. Yes, we destroyed the shuttle as it was leaving. Fine. Have the other ships send out search parties. Confirm the shuttle was destroyed. Stand by to engage atmospheric thrusters. Prepare for landing. Activate the viewscreen. (A river of lava flows from a volcano.) Extend landing struts. Ready environmental controls. (Voyager lands with a bump.) Disengage engines. Secure thruster exhaust.  [Planet surface] (The crew are all out on the ground, under guard. The Kazons take their comm. badges.) A fitting end for a people who would not share their technology. Let's see if you manage to survive without it. (The Kazons leave them.) You'd think this crew had never seen a warp drive before. If you're lying, I'll have your head. Or what? I thought you said all repairs were complete.  We've just received a message from our patrol ship. They have tracked down the shuttle from Voyager and destroyed it. They didn't say. No. But the search has been slowed down by a thoron particle leak. We'll teach them the price for attacking the Nistrim. Lay in a pursuit course. [Shuttlecraft] PAXIM  What's happening? Take evasive action. (Suder creeps into Engineering, then starts shooting the Kazons there. They are all down in moments. He drops the phaser rifle and sets about disabling the backup couplings. A Kazon shoots him in the back, but he manages to complete the sabotage with his dying breath.) Lock phasers. Destroy it. Fire! Seska! Seska! [Ready room] (Seska dies by her baby. Paris and the Talaxians beam into a transporter room.) Seska? No. Abandon ship. (He picks up the baby and leaves.) [Bridge]
