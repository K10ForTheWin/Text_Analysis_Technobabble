I was hoping you could record a short presentation about what it's like to command a starship. In your letters you said the captain puts you in charge sometimes. She must think very highly of you to give you so much responsibility. This Captain Janeway sounds like a lovely woman. Maybe I should write her. She needs to know how hard you work. Harry, I can't hear you. Tell Captain Janeway to expect a letter from me.
