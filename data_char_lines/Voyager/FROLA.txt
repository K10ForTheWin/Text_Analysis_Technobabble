Father, I'm concerned. I don't think they were very receptive. Mathematics was never your strong point, Father. You might be overestimating your support. I, I want to. Our ancestors came from somewhere else. We don't even belong here? It all just seems so incredible. Father, please, let this go. You're chasing a fantasy and you're wasting your genius. I'm worried about what's going to happen to you if you don't stop.
