Yes, ma'am. It works. Yes. He's insisting on handing it over to you personally.  Welcome to the House of Korath, Admiral. PetaQ! DabeQ chu'magh an'noQ. (I think) He said your demeanour was disrespectful. I told him if he didn't show you more respect, I would break his arm. Korath is waiting. We should go in. Excuse me? But, Admiral, I really think that With all due respect, I've been working on this for six months, and Yes, ma'am.
Stay away. You are an illusion. You're a Kos'Karii trying to lure me away B'Elanna? Then you died as well? But you don't believe in Sto-Vo-Kor. Not enough. It was you who brought this damnation upon me. I tried to guide you in the ways of a Klingon. If you had listened to me when you were younger, we wouldn't be on the Barge of the Dead. You were always running away. He abandoned us. I wanted to give you honour. And if you had understood that, I would be not be on my way to Gre'thor. Are you? You have too much anger in your heart to be sorry. Is that how you intend to lift my dishonour? By taking my place? Oh. I should have known you'd choose the easy way. You still understand nothing about being a Klingon. I would rather face damnation with what little honour you have left me, than cheat my way into Sto-Vo-Kor. B'Elanna! No! No! I forbid it! I will not abandon my daughter. You can't free me until you free yourself. You never did. Forget the ritual. It's meaningless. No, you didn't. It's not your time. You still don't understand this journey. Request denied. Who are you asking? You are the only one who can answer that question. Choose to live, B'Elanna. [Sickbay] We don't want anything from you, B'Elanna. You've taken the first step of your journey. We will see each other again. Yes, in Sto-Vo-Kor. Or, maybe, when you get home. [Sickbay]
