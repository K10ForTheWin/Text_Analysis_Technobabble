Very entertaining. Perhaps. Or perhaps it's the fabrication of a war criminal who's afraid for his life. I fail to see what this would prove. Tedran died on Voyager, a victim of a conspiracy to oppress my people. The weapon used, who fired it, this is all beside the point. But it doesn't change the fact my children can't attend the same academies as yours, or that we are forced to live outside of the city centre. I can't believe that you would cooperate with this murderer. You of all people. You built this museum. We shouldn't be listening to this hologram. I want him arrested and charged for the crimes we know he committed. No, it's not, is it? I'm only on this commission because you needed a token Kyrian. It's always about race. You seize every opportunity to keep yourselves in power. You'll pay for your crimes. [Pseudo Sickbay]
