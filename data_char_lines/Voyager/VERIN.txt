Leave them alone. (The speaker removes his hood. His face has radiation scarring.)VERIN: Who are you? What are these? Your probe? Too bad you didn't come for it sooner. It would have saved us a lot of suffering. [Corridor]   You committed genocide. [Bridge] You're from Earth?  Then you're going to pay for what your people did to us. We're not as naive as you seem to think we are, Captain. Not any more. [Bridge] I want you to get us off this planet. Find us a new home. [Bridge]  No more talking. Your people won't be safe until mine are. [Bridge]  And I don't want to kill anyone, but I will if you don't cooperate. You have three hours [Bridge] VERIN That could be a weapon. (Verin snatches it away from Yun. Brin takes it and turns it off.) These men are dangerous. I want you to stay away from them. Understood? (Yun leaves.) Then why are you with them? I suppose you're going to tell me you've changed your mind. Are you blind? How? What do you know about our situation? How did you survive? I'm sorry about what happened to your family, but don't compare your life to mine. [Bridge] There is no alternative. Otrin has too many ideas. [Bridge]  This isn't a negotiation. So instead you once again offer us the benefits of your technology. [Bridge]  If I release the hostages, what's to prevent you from leaving [Bridge] VERIN  You haven't given me any reason to. [Bridge]  You. What's your name? Set up your transport enhancers. (Carey takes the three rods from Verin and activates them.)VERIN: I'm sorry, Mister Carey. Your crewman's ready, Captain. [Bridge]  Don't force me to kill anyone else. [Bridge] We'll be ready within the hour. If you're not [Bridge] Can you? Send out patrols. Double the guard at the entrance. (The away team stun one member of a patrol approaching their position in the ruins.) Put him with the others. He stays here. Your Captain was foolish enough to think she could rescue you. Instead, she's given me another hostage. (Tuvok's guard hands him a weapon. They stuns Verin and other men. Then the guard removes his hood.) Can they rebuild our cities? Bring back the people who died? We can't trust these people. They just sent armed men to attack us. Who knows what they wanted? What's irrational is cooperating with the enemy.  Listen to me.  Are you going to stand there while he helps them destroy us? Fighting back. [Bridge] Hold him. (Brin points a rifle at Verin.) What are you doing? You'd kill me? Get that weapon away from her. I've kept you alive. All of you! Are you in command now?
