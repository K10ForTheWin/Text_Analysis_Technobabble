 Magnus. We should refuel now. The nearest dilithium is in an asteroid field just ten days from here. Home, to what? We have deviated from our flight plan, crossed the Neutral Zone, disobeyed a direct order to return. Our colleagues obviously think we are insane. We have burned our bridges, Magnus. (Annika enters.) I have a hypothesis. Her noisy parents are keeping her up. Tri-quantum waves, six hundred thousand kilometres off the port bow. Power utilisation curve is highly symmetric. It's a Borg Cube, two thousand kilometres starboard. It's massive. Twenty eight cubic kilometres, hundred and twenty nine thousand lifeforms on board. We're being scanned. They haven't altered course. Let's match their course and speed. Keep a distance of five million kilometres. [Cargo Bay two]  Magnus, you're breaking up. Much. How's Junior? [Borg Cube] I thought drones from different subunits didn't interact. Why?  Your bio-dampener is losing power. It's time to come home. Three of five, Tertiary adjunct of Unimatrix one. We think she's more like the Queen of an insect colony. She helps coordinate all the other drones. He's in his alcove. Nobody missed him. Enough drones for one day. Anybody hungry? Don't be long. [Janeway's quarters]  I've found something. A nebula. Mutara. Distance, three light years. I'm setting a course. We can reinforce structural integrity. There's no time. [Annika's room] MAGNUS The entire Collective knows about us by now. They'll send more ships. And you had to spend the night in a maturation chamber, with fifty two neonatal drones. A transwarp conduit, two point three light years starboard. It's a Cube heading right for us. One hour, maybe less.
