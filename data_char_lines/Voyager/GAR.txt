Chellick. Lucky I caught you. Well, all you have to do is listen. I have a new supply of cytogenics. Oh, I have something special this time. Oh, this item is far from substandard. And as a gesture of goodwill, I'm offering it to you first. This is much more sophisticated than that. It's a holographic construct programmed with over five million medical protocols. I would never offer you stolen property. I traded warp-grade dilithium for this programme. You'd better start cooperating, or I will dismantle your programme and sell it off one subroutine at a time. I thought we were friends, Captain. Why am I being treated this way? I think I deserve better. I have no idea. I certainly hope nothing's happened to him. Well, of course they're not. I don't know where he is. The last time I saw him he was in your Sickbay. How? What's that? React how? What have you done to me? Then give it to me.
