Q. What the hell is going on? Captain Janeway. USS Voyager. William Riker. Nice to meet you. Well, I'm sorry to say I have met him, but I've never seen this man before in my life. Sure I have. That is Colonel Thaddeus Riker after he was wounded at Pine Mountain. They used to call him Old Iron Boots. He was in command of the Hundred and Second New York during General Sherman's march on Atlanta. This picture was taken in eighteen sixty four, just after they let him out of the army hospital. I'll be damned. It's him.
