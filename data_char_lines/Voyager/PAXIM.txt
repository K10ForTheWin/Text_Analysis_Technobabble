Voyager's been taken by the Kazon-Nistrim. They're flooding every subspace frequency with the news. I'm afraid not. Lieutenant, our ships are no match for Voyager and your shuttlecraft can hardly be expected Very well. We'll rendezvous in an hour. Paxim out. They're following us as planned. We're bringing them to you. Standing by. [Bridge] (Everyone has been knocked out, except the baby, which is crying. Seska recovers first and crawls towards the sound.) I'm reading a Kazon shuttle leaving the ship. There are also escape pods being launched.
