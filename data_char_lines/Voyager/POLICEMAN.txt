Hey, Captain, how you doing? Understand you've been putting these signs up around the city again. Why don't you walk over here and we can talk about it. No need to get upset about this, we just want to talk to you about the signs. Now, there've been a few people complaining. Okay. All right. (Janeway shrugs.)
