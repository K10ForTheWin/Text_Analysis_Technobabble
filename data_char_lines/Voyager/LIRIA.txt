I'm afraid I can't oblige. No, they're very much alive. Your men have been convicted of the terrorist bombing at the Laktivia recreational facility, which resulted in the death of forty seven off-duty patrollers. We found chemical traces of the explosive used in the bombing on their hands and clothing. The explosive was trilithium based. There is no source of trilithium anywhere in our system. So, you can imagine our surprise when our investigation revealed that your ship is powered by dilithium, which our scientists tell us is convertible into trilithium. We have long suspected that the so-called Open Sky Terrorists had off-world collaborators. Now we know who they are. Prepare your ship for inspection, Captain. Communication with inmates is not permitted. Perhaps you've misunderstood me. Let me clarify our position. Your vessel is being impounded. You and your crew are under arrest. Prepare to be boarded. That, Captain, is an error in judgement. (The two small ships open fire, rocking Voyager.) I see. Your crewmen have already been tried and convicted. You are correct. I assure you, it has proved to be a most effective deterrent. Good day, Captain. (Transmission ends.)
