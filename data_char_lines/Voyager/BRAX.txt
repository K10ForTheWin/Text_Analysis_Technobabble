Brax. What's yours? I just want to see him. He doesn't look dangerous to me. (Brax leaves.) This is my home. You can't tell me what to do. Is it big? Can I see it? That's her. You won't tell her I'm here? You said you'd take me to see Voyager. You won't tell her I was here, will you? Leave her alone! (Brax throws a stone at Nocona.) I want to go too. What's this? Which station is yours? What is it? Why don't we just go back to Talax? We could live there. Maybe Neelix could go with us, and we could fight them. Take the planet back. The warp core. What's a holodeck? I'm not afraid. Can I? (The children leave.) Really? Hello, Neelix. NAOMI: Do you want to play Kadis-kot? Why? You said you were going to help us. Stay here.
