Well, Commander, Voyager's all yours. I'm sure you will. Go ahead, Mister Paris. On my way. I appreciate your concern for my safety, Mister Chakotay, but Tuvok's right. Lieutenant Paris and I will be just fine. I'll see you in twenty four hours. You're out of uniform, Commander. So I've heard. You think I don't have any friends left on Voyager? And then what? Will you kill them or just put them off the ship? I thought you were a man of your word, Chakotay. I guess I was mistaken. You've just threatened the wrong woman, Chakotay. (Transmission ends. The shuttle fires on Voyager.) Tuvok. Tom. In here.  We're going to have to transport to the cargo bay to free the rest of the prisoners. It's safer than trying to make it on foot. Let's move! Back off! Whatever you say. (Janeway fires her phaser rifle, but it backfires and kills her.)
 Congratulations.
