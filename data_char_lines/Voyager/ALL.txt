Hail Ptera!
All hail Schweitzer! Schweitzer! (Later, at table.)
Aye, sir. Ready.
Chop, chop, chop! (Three people enter.) The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Go away.
Yeah! Yeah!
For she's a jolly good fellow, for she's a jolly good fellow, for she's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.
Goodbye, daddy. [Sickbay]
