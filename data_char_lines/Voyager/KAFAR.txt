My friends, the Holy Sages. (Enter two gaudily clad - Ferengi!) Behold, the Holy Icon. (Kafar unveils the replicator, and the crowd gasp.) You called, Great Sage? Expand or die? Into the Ga'nah Province, Great Sage. I am, Great Sage. Please forgive me, Lesser Sage. You called, Great Sage? Who has the audacity to disturb the Holy Sages in their divine vault? (The person outside holds a staff through the door. A staff with a Ferengi head on it.) Of course, Greater Sage. (Neelix and Kafar leave.) Have you ever seen a Sage give away money? Like the song says, Lesser Sage, with the ringing of the bell, the sages knew where they must dwell. Like the song says, you Sages, it's time for you to go back where you came from! And they must go on wings of fire! We are fulfilling the destiny of the Sages. I'm sorry, Holy Pilgrim, but that's not part of the Song. The Holy Ones have ascended! [Transporter room] JANEWAY
