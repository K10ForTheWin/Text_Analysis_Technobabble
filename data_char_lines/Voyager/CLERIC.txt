Well, the hill is steep, and I, I'm not as young as I used to be. Protector, what exactly are you doing? Him? Sending who a letter? Had you been more attentive to my lessons when you were a boy, you would not be so gullible as a man. And that's exactly what it is. It's bad fortune to eat the fire-fruit. Oh yes, I heard about that. My condolences. Well, that you stumbled in front of several important people during the last ground shake. Uh, very embarrassing, I'm sure. Well, my hearing is not as good as it used to be, nor my memory either. Now, what were we talking about? A great mystery to which there is no answer. What? Oh, nonsense. Kelemane. Demand? Ah, better. Much better. A recompense.
