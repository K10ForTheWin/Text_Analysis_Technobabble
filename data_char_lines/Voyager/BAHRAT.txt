Bahrat, manager of this station. What can I do for you? (He doesn't look up from monitoring different screens.) Granted. But understand that any transaction you negotiate on this station is subject to my approval. I receive a twenty percent commission on all trade. Your whereabouts will be closely monitored. Communications with your ship may also be monitored, at my discretion. Do you agree to these conditions? Excellent. Meet me in my office in one hour and we'll discuss your needs. (Transmission ends.)
