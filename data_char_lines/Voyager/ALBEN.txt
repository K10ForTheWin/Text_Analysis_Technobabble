My respects to you. I'm Alben, Captain of the Narada. I thought I was familiar with every type of ship in this sector, but I've never seen anything like yours before. In that case, let me welcome you to Nasari territory. I agree with you completely, Captain. There's no reason for further hostility between us. I doubt we'll face that problem. Your crewmember won't be returning to you. No one who comes home to Taresia ever leaves again. There are rumours about those people. I fire on any Taresian I see. If you take your crewmember back on board, I will attack your ship. My best advice to you is to forget him and be on your way. (Transmission ends.) CHAKOTAY Do you think there's any truth to those rumours he mentioned?
