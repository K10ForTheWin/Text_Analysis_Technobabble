This desecration dishonours us both, Captain. This moon is our crysata. Sacred ground. Your presence is forbidden here. We found your shuttle on the surface. The pilot is dead. No, only one. If there's someone else on this moon you must transport him back to your ship immediately. This type of disturbance is exactly why we avoid contact with outsiders. I was wrong to respond to your communication. I should have known better than to indulge my curiosity. One which I expect you to correct as soon as possible. (Transmission ends.) Captain. That won't be necessary, Captain. You've been intrusive enough. There's no reason to fear for anyone's safety on the crysata. It's a blessed haven, sheltered and unspoiled, which is the very reason why I can't allow you to go there under any circumstances. That's completely unacceptable! If you launch one of your shuttles, I will be forced to send one of ours after you. Well then, leave at once.!
