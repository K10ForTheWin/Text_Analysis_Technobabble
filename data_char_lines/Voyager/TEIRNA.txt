Seska is dead. Seska thought that she could manipulate the Maje. She bragged about it to me more than once. But this time, she was wrong. We had just launched the buoy with the message for you. Then they came for her. They cut her throat as Culluh watched. He ordered them to execute me, but I bribed one of the guards to get me to a shuttle. As soon as he saw it leaving, Culluh opened fire, destroyed my life support systems. He left me in space to die. Taken to the Gema Four colony to be raised as a servant. You're going after him? This ship, alone? I want nothing to do with this. I'm not taking you into Nistrim space.  The trip would take six days at warp two. You would encounter the Nistrim fleet before a single day passed. Anyone who knows this part of space will tell you the same thing. Of course, it's safer. I don't want to run into Culluh any more than you do. Enter code sequence four nine one one seven zero Culluh. (A network of connected satellites shows up, and a curved passage through them.) That is not an end to the danger. We are heading into an area of space populated by Kazon factions that are loyal to no one. They will attack without provocation. [Bridge] I feel fine. My parents were killed in a Trabe attack shortly after I was born. I'm sure I'll make a complete recovery just in time for the Gema colony's defence force to destroy us all. No. Attacks? When there's a real Nistrim attack, you'll know it. You must scare easily, Federation. (Chakotay pushes Teirna up against the wall.) I wouldn't know.
