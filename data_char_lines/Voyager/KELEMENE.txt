You're late. More heat. (The man inflating the hot air balloon looks up.)KELEMENE: There are grave matters of state here that cannot be delayed. I'm sending him a letter. The Ground Shaker. The Light Bringer. On the contrary, you taught me well. Our ignorant ancestors believed every star was a deity. You taught me how foolish that was. Superstition, you called it. Hungry? According to whom? Our ancestors? Don't tell me you believe that old superstition? Perhaps we shouldn't completely ignore the old beliefs, no matter how strange they may seem today. Ground Shaker. Ground shaker. Isn't it possible the name was not given arbitrarily? That this star is indeed responsible for knocking down our walls and making us stumble as we walk? You heard what? I did nothing of the sort. We were talking about ancient superstitions. Now, I don't believe for a moment that the stars are gods, but then, what are they? I believe the sky is full of people just like ourselves. Prove me wrong. I say each star encompasses a city and the Ground Shaker rules one of these cities. A fellow Protector. If I'm correct, then he'll listen to me, one Protector to another. Your pen. Son of Kelemane, ruler of the good people of the land below you, demand that you stop what you're Would hope? Would hope that you might consider putting an end to whatever it is you're doing that shakes our ground. If this causes you inconvenience I'm willing to offer a recompense. I await your reply.(The cleric hands the letter to Kelemene, who then goes down steps and puts it in a container attached to the small hot air balloon. The balloon is released, and flies gently upwards.) [Engineering]
