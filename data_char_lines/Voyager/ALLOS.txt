There was an accident. We lost containment. Yes. Inside the primary test chamber. Who are you? Better, thank you. Two hundred million? I'm not certain. One point six eight terahertz. We used the molecule's own resonance to calculate the field. Obviously, it wasn't. Our equipment was destroyed. If you can transfer the molecules to your ship, maybe they can be saved. What? This is my life's work. The salvation of my people! Our resources are nearly gone. The future of my people depends on this discovery. Small-minded creatures. You destroy whatever you don't understand! Rescue ships are on the way. They won't let you do it. You don't realise what you're doing. You don't know what this is, what this means.
