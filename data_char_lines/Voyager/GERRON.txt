Yes. I said, yes. I know, I'll have to take off the earring. I'm showing a red giant system three point seven light years from our current position. There are eight planets, none of them M-class. Sensors indicate a Ferengi ship heavily damaged by weapons fire. Eight life form readings, very faint. Sir, a Romulan Warbird decloaking off the port bow. No response to the hail. Sir, there's a second Romulan ship decloaking dead ahead. It's launching torpedoes. (Bang!) Damage to decks eleven through fifteen. Reports of casualties. Shields are buckling. Hull breach on deck nine. What does it matter? Yes, sir. (Gerron heads up a ladder.)
