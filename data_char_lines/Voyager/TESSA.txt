Acknowledged. [Frozen Corridor]  Go ahead. Stand by.  I've got a lock. [Frozen Sickbay] Trouble. Long range sensors are picking up a Federation vessel. I entered a low orbit and remodulated our shields, but it won't be long before they find us. Six hours if we're lucky. Hello, Doctor. No, but I feel like we're old friends. Tessa Omond. It's an honour to finally meet Voyager's infamous EMH. Actually, they've always spoken very highly of you. Oh, I've had an interest in Voyager for a long time. The truth is, Doctor, I didn't want Chakotay or Harry to have to face this alone. I thought I could help.  These controls are a little clumsy. I thought you said this ship was state of the art. I've located the sensor logs but, the computer is denying me access. You okay? We're here to get them back. I don't supposed we have time for a tour. Now you tell me. So am I, and I have no intentions of backing out. Chakotay. Your heart has always been here, on Voyager. That'll never change. This is where you belong. And who knows, maybe we'll meet someday. Then I'll miss you all the same. [2390 Delta Flyer - lab]  They're gaining on us. Two hundred thousand kilometres and closing. You call these evasive manoeuvres? (Chakotay is the pilot here, too.)  They're hailing us. You want to talk to them? That's not much of an offer. If we succeed, those charges will never have existed in the first place. They're targeting our engines.  Shields down to sixty two percent. Direct hit. No effect on their shields. We're no match for them, Chakotay. Hold on. [2390 Delta Flyer - bridge]  We're switching to emergency back-up. [2390 Delta Flyer - lab] Our engines are down. They're locking onto us with a tractor beam. No effect. I think so, but the EPS relays have taken heavy damage. It could destabilise the warp core. And let you have all the fun?  We're free. No. Emergency systems are offline.
