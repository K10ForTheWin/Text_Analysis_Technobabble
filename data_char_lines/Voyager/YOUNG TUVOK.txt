Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations. I know all about Vulcan philosophies. I was sent against my will. I'm not a prisoner? My emotions free me. Where should I go? I can't return home. My father's banished me. They revoked my seat. Because I refused to deny myself passion, the way you and men like my father do. If I was meant to deny feelings, why was I born with them? Where's the logic in that? You speak in riddles because the truth frightens you. Yes. Why? I would question everything you say. Are you cataloguing my emotions? Isn't it obvious? If I weren't Vulcan, I wouldn't be here now going through this pointless ritual. Another riddle. I have no eyes to see behind me. My father's already explained it. Her name's Jara. Her father's a Terrelian diplomat. She's been granted a seat at my school. Yes. Yes. No. She's, Jara doesn't return my feelings. That's a lie! Who is it? I'll challenge him. You're trying to trick me. In infinite combinations. Thank you. I am grateful. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek ® is copyright of  CBS Studios Inc. Copyright © 1966, Present.
