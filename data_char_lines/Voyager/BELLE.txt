I want to be first to say goodbye to daddy. Jeffrey always goes first. No, it's really your turn. I did go first yesterday. Of course I will, daddy, and can we do some algebra problems when you get home? My daddy's a very important man. He's the best doctor there ever was, and he saves people's lives all the time. It is not. You said Mom! l can't find my ion mallet. Oh Daddy, you've got to help me. I'll be late for practice. Coach Morgan'll be furious if I'm late again. I know that, Daddy. Oh, tell Jeffrey to turn that off. It makes my eyes hurt! Daddy, I can't find your mallet! They're going to send me down to the second team! You don't understand anything! Daddy! I need my iron mallet! Daddy! Where's my mallet? I need it now! You're mean! I want my mommy here! She'd help me find my mallet! I want mommy! I want mommy! I want mommy! I want mommy! [Mess hall] Jeffrey was asleep. What are parameters? Daddy! You changed Pareses Squares from Monday, Wednesday, Friday to Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. That puts me on the second team. I'm good enough to be on the first team. You do that anyway. That's not a sacrifice. You really made a mess of things, didn't you, Daddy? How does it make the family function better if I go to Pareses Squares Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturday? But that's what's fun about it. If it'll help, Daddy, I'll be on the second team. And I think you're a very good father. I love you, Daddy, even if you did make a mess of things. [Shuttlecraft Cochrane] JANEWAY Daddy? (He hurries to her bedside.) Everything's all blurry. What's the matter? It doesn't hurt. Is that why I can't feel my legs? What's going to happen? When will I be able to see again? Daddy, what's going to happen to me? When will I be able to see again? Am I going to die? So I'm going to die? If you'll stay with me, I won't be afraid. It's getting darker. I'm sleepy.
