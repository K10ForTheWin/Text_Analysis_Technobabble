Welcome to the Qomar Planetary Alliance. Our civilisation is no doubt intimidating. We'll do what we can to avoid overwhelming you during your stay. We want to learn more about the algorithmic expressions you call music. Your Emergency Medical Hologram. We'd consider an exchange of technology, if you give us complete access to this device. No, not recordings. Recital? Will the Emergency Medical Hologram sing? Doctor. I will introduce your singing to more of our people. You will perform on our planet. I don't understand. As soon as possible.
