Go away! Then why are you pursing me? Federations, Imperiums. Why do you people feel such a need to align yourselves with monolithic organisations? Sorry, can't do that. I'm late for a very important conference. It doesn't matter. I've never heard of this wormhole you're looking for, or these so-called refugees. Well, no doubt. My research is famous. There's no point in bribing me. What do you mean by that? Professor Kashyk? Never heard of you. Obscurity! I've discovered over sixty astronomical phenomena! Interspatial flexure? Why didn't you say so in the first place? He said wormhole, a layman's term that that covers any number of phenomena. I am familiar with a certain anomaly that could be categorised as an interspatial flexure. Actually, a better question would be, where is it now? It's really quite interesting. The aperture of the phenomenon, which I prefer to call an intermittent cyclical vortex, is unfixed. It manifests infrequently for only brief periods of time and in varying locations. I can give you the last four locations. Perhaps you can extrapolate the next one, if you're as accomplished a scientist as you claim to be. [Mess hall]
