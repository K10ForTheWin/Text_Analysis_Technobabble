Ambassador, I've been analysing the debris and I've discovered disturbing evidence that the asteroids are not what they seem. They are composed of artificial materials. I must meet with you immediately. I think (Transmission lost.) I heard what sounded like a ship crashing. I came looking for you. This is Hanjuan, he's a miner at the nearby gallacite excavation. He heard your ship too. No, just you. That data is classified. I can only speak to the Ambassador. No. I prefer to wait. Be silent, Sklar! Yes, we use those to lift cargo from the surface to the orbital supply station. Yes. I've already considered that option. The carriage was damaged on the last impact. The induction coils are offline. I know it's been difficult. This catastrophe has taken it's toll on everyone. But you have got to believe us. We only want to get off the surface. What are you doing! Let go! Get away. Got to get out. Let me out. Let go of me. I'm needed. No, you don't understand. There's something out there. On the roof. (Vatm collapses.)
