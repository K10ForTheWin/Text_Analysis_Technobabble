Harry, maybe you'd like to sit down. You'll remember more about us as you spend time here. Can you read them? Something to make you feel good. You are going to stay for the celebration, aren't you? You've got to stop holding yourself back. I know you have the same natural desires as any Taresian. Now you're free to act on them. Choose both of us, then you'll only have to find one more wife. You could never be as valuable to them as you are to us. We need you. We'll make you glad you stayed. Think of Taymon, how happy he's been. Let yourself be happy. It will be wonderful. You'll have everything you ever wanted, and a place of honour among your people. This is some kind of trick. (She goes to untie Eliann, so Kim hits her over the head with a vase.)
