I'm afraid I can't let that happen. You know better than to ask that, Kellin. You're too late. She's already beginning to forget everything that's happened here. [Sickbay] Reversed? I have no idea. As far as I know, no one's ever tried. You sound desperate, Commander. Does Kellin mean that much to you? This is futile. Even if I knew how the emitter works, I wouldn't tell you. (Chakotay steps into the cell and grabs Curneth's collar. They stare at each other for a few moments, then he releases Curneth.) I have every right. The laws on our world are very specific about that. No one may leave. No one may reveal anything about us to the outside world. Kellin has violated both of those edicts. Returning her will serve as a deterrent to others who might think of leaving. We have a strong and cohesive society because of our efforts to keep it that way. A few runaways among millions hardly indicates a problem. That would suggest that we don't care about them. What a terrible message. Maybe we should wait and see if that's what happens. I've implanted a computer virus to eliminate any reference to our being here. By tomorrow afternoon, you'll have forgotten everything. It will be as though we never existed. It's better that way.
