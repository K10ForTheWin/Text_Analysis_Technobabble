We understand how you feel. Everyone here was born on other worlds. We all found our way back home like you, and discovered we're not quite who we thought we were. For males it is. They're very rare. Our population is ninety percent female.  I joined the merchant fleet so I could get into space, because I wanted to explore every quarter of the galaxy. Not controlling. Influencing, yes. You probably inherited some Taresian traits like a talent for math or music. It's just a mild mood enhancer. No side effects. You'll like it. This is Malia. She's going to be my first wife. Ah ha. Don't be afraid to indulge yourself, Harry. Everybody here wants you to be happy. You're important to us. They were right. Sounds like you were pretty lucky. They loved you. Turns out your parents were right about you. You have been special all of your life. Feels pretty good, doesn't it? I think you're going to learn to like it here, Harry. It's nothing you have to decide right now. Just enjoy yourself while you're here. Amal ulat. Let us be joined. (Everyone circles, clashing staffs occasionally. Taymon is marked with henna and blindfolded, and has his wrists tied behind his back.)
