You were first yesterday. You're right, mother. I'm sorry, Belle, you can go first. Here he comes. I hope you have a good day, Father. I'll have my homework finished by the time you get back. I've designed a microfilter implant which will make it possible to cleanse blood of harmful micro-organisms too small to stimulate an immune response. What? (Jeffery is a sullen, rebellious teenager.) Klingon. Dad, I asked them to come. It'll only take a minute. We have some business we have to do. HIquoS, pos'tach. I had a late night. That's something to look forward to. Nothing. What sacrifices did you make? What's this about no Klingon friends? You can't just decide who my friends will be. Right. This whole meeting is a Vulky idea, and you can have it without me. (Jeffery leaves.) Dad. What are you doing here? I mean, you're home early. No, no, just talking with my friends. It's a knife. What does it look like? Dad, you're making something out of nothing. Dad. Call me later. (Larg and K'kath leave.) Nothing. Never mind. They didn't talk me into anything. I asked them. It's an honour to get to perform the kut'luch. They don't just let anybody do it. They trusted me, and now you've made me look like a, like a human. I was doing it to become honourable. Something that you wouldn't understand. It isn't wrong, it's just the custom of another culture! Who are you to say there's something wrong about it. Well I'm not going to be. Your standards are human standards. They're weak and inferior. Klingon ideals are much nobler, and they are the one's I'm going to follow. If that's the way you want it, then I won't live here. Oh, I've thought about it. I'm going to become a warrior, and I can't do that if I'm being led around on leash by some bloodless petaQ. (Jeffery leaves the house. The monitor beeps.) Dad. (The EMH and Jeffery hug while Charlene holds Belle's hand.)
