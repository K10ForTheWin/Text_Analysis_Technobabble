It could be dangerous, sneaking up on a man like that. A puzzle. What brings you here, Talaxian? The dancer showed it to me. By moving only two rods this dodecahedron can become an icosahedron. She said she'd spend the night with the man who could solve it. You know how to solve this? You must think us very isolated. Everyone knows that. It's probably the only reason you were allowed in here. Especially after last time. Go on. An alliance? Between the Kazon Pommar and the Federations? I have no idea who this person is. Some lunatic who sat down and started babbling. Don't talk about that here. It could mean my head. Does the table shape seem acceptable? I am, I swear. I want to thank you for making it possible to have the conference here on Sobras. My Maje has rewarded me handsomely for the prestige it affords him. If there is any further way I can be of service, please let me know. (Tersa leaves as Janeway and Tuvok enter with Mabus.) The First Majes of the Kazon Order. Minnis of the Pommar. Surat of the Mostral. Loran of the Hobii. Valek of the Oglamar. And Culluh of the Nistrim. Our gracious host Jal Minnis has provided food and drink to make our discussions more pleasant.
