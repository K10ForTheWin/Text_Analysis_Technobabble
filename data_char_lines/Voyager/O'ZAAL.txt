 We have teams that have travelled quite a distance, Captain, but none from as far as the Alpha Quadrant. Well, your entrance petition seems to be in order. The Delta Flyer meets our guidelines. Now all you have to do is win. I asked not to be disturbed. Did you explain that we've already promised that to the Chessu. Arrange for another meeting. I'll have to find some way of appeasing them. Well, I hope the race you just entered doesn't end before it begins. The peace is still very fragile. Every decision I make, no matter how trivial, is looked upon as symbolic. Another is offended, yes. That would be wonderful, but how? If your racing skills are as sharp as your diplomatic instincts, the other teams won't have a chance. [Mess hall] The pre-race get-together is going with a swing. Paris and Kim are wearing new uniforms with grey and black Welcome to the first running of the Antarian Trans-Stellar Rally. This moment marks a hopeful point [Delta Flyer] O'ZAAL  Captain, the honour is yours. Why? You're doing a poor job of defending yourself. This may be more than a simple case of cheating, Captain. I think someone's trying to end the peace. By itself it wouldn't. But we received several threats of a more serious nature. Groups opposed to the alliance. Arms dealers, isolationists, political extremists. Up until now I wasn't sure how seriously to take them. Yes, yes. We've done everything we could to protect the races, but that may not be enough. I don't want to risk any more lives. We should cancel the race, or at least postpone i,t until we can guarantee everyone's safety. Very well, then. If that's the consensus, we'll resume tomorrow as scheduled. Of course, Captain, if you decide to withdraw, we'd understand. I'm sorry your team didn't win, Captain. (Voyager shakes slightly from the explosion.)
