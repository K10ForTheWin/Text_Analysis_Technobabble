Go on, I'm listening. Very interesting, Culluh, but what does all this have to do with me?  Our sects have been blood enemies for generations, and yet now you ask for my help to defeat this Voyager. Why not simply do it yourselves? I'll tell you why. Because the Nistrim are weak and the Relora are strong. Your grandfather's time has passed, Culluh. You've presided over the demise of your own sect, whittled away your strength And I congratulate you on the daring and cunning of your raid. Now, why don't you give me this transporter technology, assuming it's authentic, and let the Relora do what we do best? When we have defeated the Voyager, we will not forget the Nistrim's assistance. Then perhaps we will have to take it. (The two Majes point weapons at each other.) Listen to your woman, Culluh. [Bridge]
