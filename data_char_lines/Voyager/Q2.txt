Aunt Kathy. Yell at me later. We need to get Icheb to Sickbay. [Sickbay]
Ta-da! Thank you. Oh, it would be an interruption to the Continuum. It would change the very nature of Q. No, because we're not even sure what the end result would be. His suicide could have all sorts of unknown consequences to the Continuum. No Q has ever tried to commit suicide. Immortality is one of the defining qualities of being a Q. By every measure of the Continuum, his remarks would have to be considered as mentally unbalanced. What more do I need? He wants to kill himself. Not anymore, it isn't. On rare occasions, yes. Their crimes created the interruption. Their deaths ended it. I know where you're going with this, Lieutenant. And it's not going to work. Our society, like any other, must control its disruptive elements. An execution may be undesirable, I grant you that, but on some rare occasions it is necessary and warranted. And the decision to proceed is only made after great deliberation by the entire Continuum. You can not imagine the chaos that would be created if individuals like Q here, could choose between life and death. This is a matter of social order versus anarchy. No. My record has been expunged.
