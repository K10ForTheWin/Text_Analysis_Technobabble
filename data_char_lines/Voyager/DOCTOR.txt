Run a level three diagnostic, just to be sure. Can I help you? Oh yes. The observer. I was a surgeon at the hospital on Caldic Prime at the same time you were stationed there. We never actually met. Your medical records have arrived from your last posting, Mister Paris. Everything seems to be in order. The Captain asked if you were on board. You should check in with her. Well, Mister Kim, that would be a good thing for a new operations officer to do.  [Corridor]
What do you see, Mister Paris? Good. That's exactly what you should see. (We go through in to the conservatory to see Paris passionately kissing an alien woman.) [Room] I'm sure it's disorienting to see yourself through another man's eyes. The trial's over, Mister Paris. There's no point to further denials. [Tolen's memory] TOLEN  Let the record show that the sentence of the court has been carried out. For the rest of his natural life, once every fourteen hours, Thomas Eugene Paris will relive the last moments of his victim's life. May the fates have mercy on you, sir.

Their doctors might be better suited to stabilise his condition. There is no legal precedent, of course, but we can petition the courts immediately. I'll make the necessary preparations. (Transmission ends. Janeway nods to Tuvok, who has been listening out of shot.) [Shuttlecraft] But that simply isn't possible for this procedure. Are we supposed to take your word for all of this? I'm not going to listen to any of this. So we're the same height. It proves nothing. I never saw this woman prior to the death of her husband. I was never even in this house before today.
