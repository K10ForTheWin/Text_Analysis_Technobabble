I landed my ship on the nearest of those twenty one moons. My navigator and I disembarked to start repairs. Damage was extensive. More than we'd anticipated. The hours past, the air grew cold, and with our weapons we started a fire to keep warm. Later, in the night, we awoke with a shudder. The ground was shaking. A moon quake. What could have been worse? We leapt into the ship, hoping the tremor would pass, but it was no tremor and it did not pass. For it was no moon we had landed on. A creature. A living being so massive it generated it's own gravitational field. So immense it supported it's own ecosystem. How long had it been lying there, dormant, slumbering, until wakened by our fire. Years? Centuries? Perhaps. Perhaps your sensors were faulty, or too busy gazing at your own reflection to bother looking out the window. This is my Lodge. I say what I want. And you can go elsewhere. No. (Nakahn leaves the table.) Come back tomorrow. We exchanged sharp words because of his arrogance, that was all. Untrue. I suppose they are. But I didn't. I was working late. You have no proof. (Zahir enters, leaning on Chakotay's shoulder.) Sorry I'm late. It won't even leave the ground. Captain Janeway knows where you are. The ship is cordoned off, the entire area, to stop you from leaving. I still get paid. I held up my end of the deal. I booked your passage. It's not my fault they want her back so badly. (The EMH hits Nakahn.) If somebody's going to die today, it won't be me. (The EMH flickers.)
