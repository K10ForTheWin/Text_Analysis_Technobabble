I would bid you welcome to my hall, but the days of glad tidings are gone from this place. We grieve with you for your kinsman. We had hoped that a warrior of Beowulf 's strength and renown would be able to deliver us from our curse. (Hrothgar is helped to his throne by Unferth.) It's true. Grendel. Repelled by light and laughter, the beast waits until we slumber. Then bereft of remorse, Grendel comes in murderous rage to my hall to take my people, and there is nothing anyone can do to stop it. If you are wise, you will forego your vengeance and return home. Death lives here now. You are able warriors. You may stand sentry tonight. (The Danes leave.) I would bid you welcome to my hall, but the days of glad tidings are gone from this place. Eat. Eat. Elk. When I built this hall, the forest ran thick with them. But today, game's more scarce. Enjoy it, Lord Schweitzer. It is a great delicacy in our land. We rarely hear stories of other lands. Honour us with a tale of your home to gladden our hearts. Please, indulge us. A truly unique tale. Come, Lord Schweitzer. Allow me to show you my home. If you are in need of anything, please do not hesitate to ask. You're a true champion, always ready for the fight. Ah, perhaps you would like some mead to fortify yourself for the battle. Away! You're disturbing Lord Schweitzer! It was with that weapon I made my first kill. I was eleven years old. Well, it's a poor weapon, I agree, but a token of my youth. You must have similar trophies from your own childhood. Well, I'm certain you distinguished yourself in battle many times and did honour to your father. Always with you it is time to sleep. Perhaps you have forgotten that the work of a warrior is battle not rest. You would do well to learn from Lord Schweitzer. This was a beautiful hall once, before Grendel. You will make it so again. You have our thanks.
