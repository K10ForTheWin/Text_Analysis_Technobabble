Aye sir. [Transporter room 3] (The transport completes. The aliens look like they are constructed from bits and pieces, like Frankenstein's poor monster.)
Excuse me.
Go ahead. Understood.
Bridge to Ensign Kim. The Captain can see you now.
Negative, Commander. I'm not reading any sign of her.
Aye Sir. Yes, Lieutenant. [Sandrine's]
Yes, sir. Rate's holding steady.
I can't lock onto him. His pattern keeps changing. I got him! I got him! Over there! Shut it all down! (A phaser shot disables the monitor.)
I'll take a piece of that.
We have him, Captain. He's all right. (Whumph!) Aye, Captain. All I got was his comm. badge, Captain.
We've got wounded here. (Shortly after, the biobeds are fully occupied, and patients are lying on the floor.) Yes, sir.
Yes, Lieutenant. (Kes and Neelix are beamed out. A pair of monks arrive.)
Checking all systems, Captain. (The wave passes on, leaving them.)
Aye, sir.
Bridge to the Captain. You have an incoming transmission from the planet.
Engineering is secure. Transporter room one is under control. Shuttlebay is secured, Commander.
Ensign, on the double. [Corridor]
