You don't have to go, Tom. He's got no right. No, Tom, don't! Stop! No! [Room] Tom! Don't, Tom! [Room] So, you've done it to me again. Hello. You might have called. No, it's fine. I have some leftover rolk from yesterday. I'll just throw it in the stew. Would you like a drink? Help yourself. (Lidell leaves.) If it's spoiled, Neeka wouldn't eat it. (Later, Tolen is serving the stew.) Whether you are here or not makes no difference. Tolen would work anyway. The meat doesn't taste right. (She leaves. Neeka eats the food happily.) You must be a very superior species. Maybe I kill myself slowly because I don't have the courage to do it quickly. Don't. Don't get involved, Lieutenant. You'll be sorry. Why don't you go ahead and ask me? What you've been wanting to ask me all night. What they all want to ask me. Why I'd marry a man old enough to be my father. He was good to me. A lot of other men weren't. He's a good man. I would never do anything to hurt him. Good can get very boring. [Tolen's memory] Yes? Are you a friend of Tom's? Stop it, Neeka! She just doesn't like strangers. (Tuvok enters.) Yes, right there. I had to have a professional cleaning crew come in to remove the bloodstain. This has been my home for over ten years, Mister Tuvok. Do you really find that so hard to believe? Dispassionate? Is that how I seem to you? I think you'd get an argument from Tom Paris. Can I get you a drink? Mind if I have one? I never said there was an argument, Lieutenant. Have you ever had to end a marriage? Are you married? I'm sure she's a fine, dispassionate woman. I hope you never have to find out for yourself, but I can tell you, ending a marriage, it's a quiet thing. The arguments are long over and there's really nothing much left to say at all. Because I was attracted to another man. I didn't want to deceive my husband. Meeting Tom gave me the push I needed. I already knew in my heart that it was time to start over. I went to see him at the Engineering Institute after I talked with my husband. Once I was free, I knew he wanted to be with me. A woman knows, Lieutenant. (Lidell's memory.) I'm completely soaked! Here, let me help you. (Laughing, Lidell pulls of Paris' boots. Then she pulls him down to her and they kiss.) It's okay. He knows it's over. I haven't been married for years, Tom. To him, I'm a friend, a companion. He hasn't treated me like a woman since, it must've been the day of the eclipse four years ago. He was very excited by the eclipse. Don't ask me why. You'll be gone in a few days. This is the only time we've got. Let me make you something to warm you up. I love to drink Marob root tea on rainy afternoons. (Back to now.) I made some tea, we talked for a while, then we went out to the atrium to watch the storm and the rest you know. I saw Tom murder my husband, Mister Tuvok. I tried to stop him. I couldn't. Lieutenant, when you see Tom, would you tell him that I forgive him? [Sickbay] You don't have to go, Tom. He's got no right. No, Tom, don't! Stop! No! [Sickbay] (Tuvok nearly collapses.) You're forgetting one thing. I was here and I saw him do it. What for? How do you know what my husband saw? He lied to me, Tom. No one was supposed to get hurt. You know I could never do anything to hurt you.
