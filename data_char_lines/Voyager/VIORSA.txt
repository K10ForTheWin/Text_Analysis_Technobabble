I am Viorsa, planner for the Kohl settlement. Your sensors have activated this message. By now you must be aware of the catastrophic disaster that has destroyed our home. A few of us have managed to survive in a state of artificial hibernation, programmed to end in fifteen years from the date this was recorded. At that time, when the eco-recovery has begun, we will attempt to rebuild our settlement. Please, do nothing to interrupt our timetable. Stop! They're aliens, and they won't be alone. Kill them, and their shipmates will shut down the programme. We knew this would happen someday, that a ship would find us. It was only a matter of time. Who knows what kind of people they are? Who knows what will happen to this world if you hurt them? Stop this. He can do it. He's already killed two of our colleagues. It happened over months without our even realising it. All of us had fears about survival, recovery. We never anticipated the computer would manifest those fears into him. But there is a delay before he becomes aware of what we're thinking.  I regret very much what has happened to you. You came to help. You didn't deserve this. I regret so many things. You'll leave hope behind after a few months of this. It might require a recalibration of the optronic pathways.  No, please! I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything! [Cargo Bay 1] (A forcefield activates in the optronics control panel.) Don't do this! No! [Cargo Bay 1]
