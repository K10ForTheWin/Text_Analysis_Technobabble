This one looks like an Indian, and that one, I don't know what her story is. Careful, Butch, she looks like a fighter. You first. Are you spying on us, Chief? USS equals Federal Government. The Federal Government is the Beast. That'll be all. Call for reinforcements. (Butch leaves. Porter settles himself in a chair.) It's going to be a long day. [Rain's Camper van] (Rain is driving.) The Beast has many heads and I'm looking at two of them. You are no patriot. How many? This is it, men. Get into position behind the house. Butch and me'll take these two. (The newcomers arm themselves.) Looks like your friends out there still believe in violence. Too bad for you. [Rain's Camper van] Get off my land! They've got lasers! A black man and some bald guy. (The EMH enters. Porter and Butch's bullets go straight through him.) God in heaven help us.
