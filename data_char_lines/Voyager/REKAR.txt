I told you to mask our warp trail. You'd be surprised how stubborn humans can be. Raise shields and prepare to fire phasers. [Prometheus Sickbay] Engage the multivector assault mode. Then we'll test it now. I gave you an order and I expect you to follow it. Multivector assault mode. Now! Attack pattern beta four seven. The Starfleet vessel, bearing one six two mark seven. I think we should consider that a successful test. Begin the reintegration sequence, then get me a full damage report. Take him to the medical bay. [Prometheus Sickbay] No one here is sick. Conduct your scans. How far are we from our border? Alter our heading to one one eight mark two six. There's been a change of plans. We're giving this ship to someone who'll make full use of it's potential. The Tal'Shiar. I've made arrangements to rendezvous with their fleet within the hour. You have your orders. What are you doing? You haven't taken any readings at all.(The EMH taps the tricorder.)EMH: Hmm. [Sickbay]  What else have you done to this ship? I will deactivate you unless you start answering my questions. You are nothing but a computer generated projection. I find it hard to believe you're capable of taking these actions independently. Tell me, who is operating your programme? Is it someone on this ship? A Starfleet crew member we missed, or one of my own men? Who sent it? So, Starfleet has managed to sneak a holographic operative aboard. Very clever. This is pointless. Proceed.
