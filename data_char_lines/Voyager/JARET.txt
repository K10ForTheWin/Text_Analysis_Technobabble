We'll be glad to assist you in any way, Captain. Good evening, Ensign. Thank you for coming. I asked Eudana to invite you here because I was sure you would respond to her, and because it would look perfectly natural. I am prepared to accept your collection of literature in exchange for our trajector technology. Officially? No. But many people believe that rules should be flexible enough to meet the needs of the moment. There is a great desire here for new stories and I want to be the one to supply them. We will both benefit. I would gain prestige and you would gain forty thousand light years in your journey home, possibly more. This is it, Ensign. The matrix of the trajector. (Jaret gives Kim a device.) He won't. He never had any intention of helping you leave here. You must believe me when I tell you this is the only way you will make that journey. Consider my offer. I'm sure you will decide it is a fair one. [Mess hall]
