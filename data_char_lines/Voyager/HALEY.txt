It's coming, Doctor! Come in! Mister Barclay. Is something wrong? He's not taking visitors today. He's in a prickly mood.  Lunch. It's salad. It's healthy. Lieutenant Barclay is here to see you. He says it's urgent. Be civil to him, Lewis. He's worried about you. We all are. (Haley leaves, Barclay enters.) Sounds like you're making progress. He only teases people he likes.  Doctor? You have a visitor. (Troi enters.) Mister Barclay said this is your favourite ice cream. How do you know? Nine years ago. Yes. Maybe you should ask him. He was extremely proud of the Mark One. He used to dream about hundreds of holograms in every corner of the quadrant saving lives. He put so much of himself into its development. I suppose it only seemed natural that it should look like him, too. He was devastated. He made that mistake once. He wasn't about to do it again. Is that how you feel about me? Just a hologram? Stardate 53292. My programme malfunctioned and you cancelled a lecture on Vulcan and came all the way home to repair me. You came back because you cared about me, just like you care about the Mark One. You just won't admit it. He may not be perfect, but he's still one of your creations and right now he needs his creator.
