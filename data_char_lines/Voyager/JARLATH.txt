Sorry for the intrusion, but l wanted to welcome you. I'm Jarlath, your neighbour. My people live in the other environment, through that portal. It's quite different, more desert-like. This place is so green, but I'm sure it's suitable for you. The Nyrians undoubtedly had a good look through your databanks. They took us one by one. Ah, is this what you eat? They claimed not to know what was happening, and by the time we got suspicious, there were too many of them. We've been here ever since. No. Mmm, not bad. Would you be interested in trading for some of these? The last inhabitants of this environment had no concept of a barter system, but you strike me as a much more sophisticated group. Oh, l don't think you'd like their method of escape. They all died from a plague. Pretty well camouflaged, isn't it? It took are almost nine years to find the portal. Well, I, I have my ways. Well, I'd be happy to make a trade, but the portal only leads into our environment. You're welcome to visit, of course. I look forward to our collaboration. (Night time. Torres is fiddling with the EMH's mobile emitter.)
