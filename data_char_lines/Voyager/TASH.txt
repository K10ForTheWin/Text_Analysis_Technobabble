I recommend maximum shielding. There are a few technical issues I haven't worked out yet. If I don't find a way to repair this power core they'll be able to see the explosion all the way to, er, where did you say you were from? All the way to Earth. Catapult a vessel across space, in the time it takes to say catapult a vessel across space. It'll make warp drive look like a wooden sledge. Hmm? [Briefing room]  The core sends a graviton surge through the projectors which locks onto a ship and sends it hurtling into null space, to emerge a few hours later hundreds, if not thousands, of light years away. Simple. I've been looking for a way to get home. I'd been exploring an unstable wormhole. Before I knew it, I was here and my home planet was there. I was facing a journey of at least ten years. Instead, I decided to build a catapult. Two weeks ago I sent a probe nearly six hundred light years. But it destabilised the core. I've been trying to fix it ever since. No, no, it's too dangerous. I wouldn't send my own crew in there. That's generous, but I have nothing to give in return. You could use the catapult after I've made my jump. It should still be functional. A thousand light years won't exactly get you back to Earth. Is this any way to treat a colleague? I acquired the tetryon reactor at great cost. This territory is full of species who would do anything for such advanced technology, including steal it. I apologise for the deception, but you do understand. Thank you, Captain. I'll contact you the moment I re-enter normal space. Thank you, Captain. Goodbye to you all. Success, Captain. Five thousand light years. A few systems overloaded, nothing serious. I had to readjust my shields during mid-flight. Almost lost my outer hull. I'm sending you the modifications. My catapult is yours, Captain. Good luck.
