We've been trying to get out of here for years. The closest I ever came was finding the portal between our two environments. I don't mean to be pessimistic, but I don't think there is a way out. Well, I know it's too early for you to accept this, but life here isn't so bad. Once we stopped trying to escape, we actually began enjoying ourselves. I don't think we're supposed to be in here. Let's go back. We have to help ourselves. This is our chance to get back into our own environments. I surrender. I'm sorry. It wasn't my idea. They made me come along. They, er, went around that corner.
