I saw them. They appeared out of thin air! They're some kind of demons. I saw them with my own eyes. They're lying! But, I'm telling you. I know you're lying. The officer told me you came here on the continental transport. Yeah? Well I just talked to the transport attendant, He told me four people came today from Kalto. Two of them were a lot older than you and they had a child with them. So, where's the child? Let me go! Don't trust them. They aren't who they say they are. They lied about coming here on the Continental transport. I talked to the attendant myself. Let me go. You don't scare me. My father works for the Media Bureau and when I tell him all about this Yes, and so am I. I report for my school journal. That's right where everyone's going to find out about you when I write about this in next week's edition. Latika. For what? You mean I was right? You saved my life. Yeah.
