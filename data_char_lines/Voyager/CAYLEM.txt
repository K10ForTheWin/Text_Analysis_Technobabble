Get away from her! [Engineering] Look who's awake. Just rest. You must be thirsty. Maybe hungry for a little something? What shall I make? What can I make? What? What? (Janeway feels for her comm. badge.) Oh, it hasn't been that long. I wish I had some. This will do. Drink. I'll fix you some soup. Now, just lie down. You're safe now. Shush. Don't worry. Everything's all right now. My little girl is home. (Later.) But you know there's nothing I wouldn't do for my sweet Ralkana. Kathryn? That's an unusual name. Very pretty. I like it. Wonderful. Captain Kathryn of a glorious starship. Then what happens? Go on, I'm listening. I love your stories. Communications. Oh, we're not supposed to have any of that. The Mokra don't allow it. I know what you'd like. Some talsa root soup. You really should be more careful out there. Those Mokra will pick a fight for no reason. I don't want you getting hurt again. But I saw the way you handled that ugly one. I couldn't have done any better. I was so proud of you, Ralkana. I'm afraid so. The prison. The soup. I'm forgetting the soup. You're right. The time has come. Now that we're together again, we can't wait another day. My beautiful and brave girl. The Mokra won't stand a chance against us. You must eat and rest to get your strength back. We'll leave soon enough. We don't want to keep her waiting any longer than we have to. She must miss you so terribly. It's hard to bear thinking of her alone in that dark cell. It's been difficult for all of us. Don't worry, we'll get her out. You'll see your mother again. [Briefing room] They're everywhere, searching the whole area. You've always been a troublemaker, ever since you could walk. I've never seen such a wilful child, but that's what I love most about you. Your spirit. Now, don't worry. When they come through here, we'll be gone already. Your mother will want some of her things. Ah, a pretty dress to wear. Why, if my precious girl is involved, then I am involved too. (Caylem holds up a necklace.) Do you remember this? She always used to wear it on special occasions. I think today would count as one. You know what I think she would like even more is to see you wear it. Be careful. This won't heal if you move around too much. Yes. All of it. Lots of guards. The Mokra make a big show of it, always bragging about how no one has ever escaped. I'm not afraid. If I stay here I can't bring the letters. Letters. Don't you remember how we used to write to her together? Here they are. I still write them every week since she's been gone. I've always known that one day I'd be able to give them to her. I've never forgotten. My last letter. My last letter's not, it's not here. Oh. I wrote it three days ago, but it's not. I can't let her think I've stopped writing, that I gave up hope only days before. I'll write it again. My hand, my hand shakes sometimes. You write it so it looks nice. The last one. The last one was about. My memory isn't very good. Oh, I remember. I went walking in the morning. It was very cold. Tell her I wore my sweater. She worries about that sort of thing, and, and I what? And I saw that they had torn down that old building where you and the other children used to play. And tell her it rained for two and a half days. I don't know if she can see the sky where they're keeping her. And there was more. There was something about a friend. I, why can't I remember? I wanted to tell her! Yes. Yes, you're right. She will. Please let me come with you. There. This is a waste of time. We don't need him anyway. Monster! (Janeway drags him round the corner.) He's the one. He took your mother. We have to Good morning! I seem to have lost my hat. It's about this big. (Caylem polishes Augris' boots. Darod gets away.) Have you seen my hat? Without my hat? (Augris puts a bun in Caylem's mouth, and half a melon on his head.) It's all right now. They've gone. (In the prison, Torres is looking for other means of escape when she hears Tuvok screaming.) [Bridge] I know about the prison. Spoken like a coward. Yes, you can. If it'll help to bring her back to us. You mustn't believe what he told you about me. I had to keep my little girl safe. It was just too dangerous to get involved. Can you understand? Your mother wouldn't listen. She wanted to fight. She was always so passionate about what she believed in. She didn't care about the risk. I didn't want to loose her. I didn't want you to grow up without a mother. I tried so hard to change her mind, and finally she changed mine. She convinced me to go with her. I said I would meet her by the river. She was leading a raid against a Mokra supply centre. I said I would meet her, but I didn't. I couldn't. I was too afraid. She was still waiting for me when they arrested her. I could never tell you about this. I knew you would hate me. I couldn't bear that. Please, Ralkana, if you can ever forgive me. (Janeway hugs Caylem.) What is it? Then it's time to go. (Janeway gets up behind the man, then happens to look down. She drags Caylem away.) What happened? A trap. And you saw it, my clever girl. We'll be all right. We have each other. That's we'll need. I like the strategy. (Janeway takes the guard's gun and shoots the other one. Then she works on the forcefield control. Caylem takes the guard's dagger.) We're ready to go. Of course I am. We settled this. You told that man, Darod, how I saved you from the Mokra! Wait! Ralkana! No! [Bridge] There you are. I would do everything in my power to protect my only child. [Bridge] Ralkana, the other cells are this way. We must find your mother. Lies! Lies! Lies! No. No! I won't let you hurt her! (Caylem attacks Augris. The diversion lets the away team overpower the Mokra. More arrive but Tuvok holds them off. Augris finally throws off Caylem and the guards shoot him. Augris staggers back with the knife in his chest. The guards leave.) Ralkana? He said you'd been shot. And your mother? My sweet girl. (Caylem dies. The rescue party arrive.)
