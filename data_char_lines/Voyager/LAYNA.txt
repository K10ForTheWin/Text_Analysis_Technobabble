I know what I'm doing. Get into the escape pod. No one is going to die. Go. Shall we celebrate, the two of us? I'm sorry to disappoint you. I am sorry to disappoint you. [Delta Flyer - night] I followed you here expecting to find a love nest. It's quite a nest. You're no poet from across the sea. You're an Eternal. Maybe even B'Elanna Torres herself. You know all he thinks about is you? If you come to the performance tomorrow night, I'll expose you to the Autarch. Just leave us alone. Fix your ship and go, please. (Layna runs out, crying.) Your collaborator's probably halfway across the Eastern Sea by now. Captain. And B'Elanna Torres? (to audience) Her eyes and her ears. And the viper in her nest. I, Seven of Nine, have no intention of finding B'Elanna Torres. I, Seven of Nine, am Queen of the Borg. Surprised? No one will be more surprised than Janeway when I take my revenge on Voyager. Say nothing or you, too, will be assimilated. (toÂ Janeway) Captain, I will comply. (exits) Also irrelevant. How foolish of you to let me go, free to attack you again. And I told you not to. Wait! She's not from across the Eastern Sea. She's an Eternal. I'm telling you she's B'Elanna Torres. The real B'Elanna Torres! I saw her ship.
