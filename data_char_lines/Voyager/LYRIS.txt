Alien vessel, this is the Taresian starship. There you are! Our sensors detected you aboard your ship. I'm glad to see you're safe. In a way. I know you are one of my people. You're Taresian. Welcome home. Captain's log 50732.4. The Taresians have escorted us back to their homeworld so we can continue to investigate their claim that Ensign Kim is a member of their race. [Taresia] (The away team of Janeway, Tuvok, Kim and Paris are greeted by a phalanx of women.)
