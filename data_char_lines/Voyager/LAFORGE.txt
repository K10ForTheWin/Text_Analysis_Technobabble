This is Captain La Forge of the Starship Challenger. You seem to be in quite a hurry. (Geordi is in a DS9 style uniform with an All Good Things comm.badge. He doesn't wear the VISOR any more, either.) Why don't you shut down those impulse engines, drop your shields. Let's talk about this face-to-face. As a matter of fact, I do. We know what you're about to attempt and we can't let that happen, so the Federation Council is willing to make you an offer. Hand over the Borg transmitter, stand down your vessel, and the charges of conspiracy will be dropped. If you succeed, countless lives will be affected. I understand and I might be doing the same thing if I were in your position, but I've got my own crew to protect, not to mention fifteen years of history. So, I'm asking you again. Stand down, and return the transmitter. And you know I have to try to stop you. Same to you. Â (Transmission ends. Whumph!) La Forge to Delta Flyer. Our sensors are reading an overload in your warp matrix. Lower your shields. We'll beam you out of there.
