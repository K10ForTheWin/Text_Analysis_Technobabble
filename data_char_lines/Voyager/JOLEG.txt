Thanks for standing up to Yediq. Still, it was kind. [Sickbay] Iko was just telling me he didn't get enough to eat. Yediq likes to keep us hungry. You're wondering why I'm here. You're wondering what I did to end up with men like them. That's right. (Neelix hands Joleg his meal.) Because I'm Benkaran. It's common knowledge that all Benkarans are criminals. So when I was found in the vicinity of a murder, I was immediately arrested. I told you, I'm Benkaran. What I say doesn't matter. [Sickbay]  Eleven six, green. The statistics won't save me. That's what the family wants. After you're convicted, the family of the victim sentences you. Vekto valek k'vadim. It's ancient Nygean. It means Favour The Victims. What if I stole your game board? What right would a judge have to assign value to your loss? To him, it's just a game board, but to you it might be a priceless family possession. And what if I murdered your child? Vekto valek k'vadim. It's the basis for the Nygean legal system. Some people prefer restitution to revenge. If a defendant is wealthy enough, he can negotiate a settlement with the victim's family. It's perfectly fair, unless you're destitute. I'm grateful. But it would imply I'm guilty. I wouldn't want that. You can transmit a letter to my brother. I'd like to let him know what's happened to me. You have five minutes to get us a shuttle.  Seal it. (A prisoner welds the doors shut with his rifle.) Then I suppose I should kill you right now. Afraid I'll beat you again? What do you mean? Neelix, I swear I had no idea he would do that. You have to believe me. I can't eat this. I'm sick. No, I must have the same condition Iko had. If your Doctor cures me, I can make an appeal for my life, too.(Neelix walks away.) [Astrometrics lab]
