I'm worried about Seven of Nine. We should re-examine the question of simply asking I know. Yes. We, I apologise for my indecision. Rerouting sensor input to secondary processors.(On the bridge, Tuvok detects something going on.) [Turbolift] We must abort. When we're asleep, we experience each other's dreams. It has to stop. We must break the neural link. Planet one eight six five alpha. You must remember. We were a subset within the Collective. We had to break free, so we worked together. We finally escaped. We need to find out what happened eight years ago, after the crash. Yes. No. My last memory No. It's a designation. You're an individual now. The memories, even the thoughts flow from one to the other. We're not individuals. Ready. You're responsible for our suffering. I had no idea you were going to say that. I don't know what either of you is thinking. I'm leaving as well. There's an uninhabited planet only a few lightÂ years from here. I'd like to spend my final days in the open
