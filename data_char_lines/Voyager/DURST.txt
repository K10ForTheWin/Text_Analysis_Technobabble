Warp engines still within normal parameters, Captain. (Whumph.) So what exactly are we securing against? Noncorporeal? That means it can probably move through a bulk (A turbolift door opens to reveal Tuvok and Kes unconscious.) Captain, we're entering the nebula. The warp core's been ejected. Tuvok's engaged emergency thrusters. We're moving again, Captain. (Voyager enters the nebula.) Shields down to sixty five percent, Captain! The energy beings are starting to penetrate our defences. (In Sickbay, an entity enters Neelix. He goes to the medicine wheel and moves the stones.) Shields failing. The aliens are penetrating the hull.
We've got to find a way out of this place. There don't seem to be many of them. I guess they figure we're all so exhausted we don't have any fight left. Hilarious. What for? It's okay, Tom. They're the ones with the guns, remember? (Durst is taken away. Torres is covering in the shadows.)
