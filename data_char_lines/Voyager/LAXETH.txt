Those days are behind me. I'm legitimate now. I'm communications master of a Talaxian convoy. Looks like I'll be seeing you in a few days. We've been asked to rendezvous with your ship. We're going to pick up a passenger. Apparently, it's a member of your crew. All I know is someone wants to leave your ship and come to work for us. [Ready room] Captain Janeway. We were attacked by the Kazon-Nistrim. We have no serious casualties, and they didn't take any of our cargo. The one thing they were interested in was your former crewman, Thomas Paris. They took him aboard their ship and then left. I thought you'd want to know. [Kazon ship]
