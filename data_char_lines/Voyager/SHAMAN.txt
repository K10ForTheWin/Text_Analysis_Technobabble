To answer that, we must learn the nature of this god. We must understand the reason for his arrival. You were making an offering to Tahal. The fire-fruit. Where is it? (It had fallen onto the ground. The shaman picks it up.)SHAMAN: The new one doesn't want Tahal to have the fire-fruit. Make an altar for him, as big as Tahal's. The fire-fruit is only for the New One. No more for the people. It is His alone. Ground Shaker, Light Bringer, take this today, and every day. Accept our offering. Do not harm us. [Bridge]
