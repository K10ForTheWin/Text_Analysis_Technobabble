I'd have more faith in your security precautions if you weren't already at the mercy of this weapon. This particular series has a class eleven intelligence factor. It's warp-capable, fully armoured, self-guiding. It has a maximum range of eighty light years. It can fly through an ion storm or an armada of hostile ships and still find its target. You can't. But I can. My transporter system employs a dampening field which disables the detonator until my engineers can disarm it. The device itself. Oh, my business is salvage, not war. I've no intention of deploying it. I can make more profit by selling off it's components. The energy matrix alone can power a fleet of starships. And its intelligence core, properly reprogrammed, can assist in a variety of things, from terraforming to planetary weather control. I'm afraid that's unacceptable. The energy matrix is one of the most valuable components. That matrix worth a thousand dilithium crystals. I want the entire weapon, or it remains here. Captain? I wish you luck. (He beams himself away.)
