I believe you. What do you intend to do now? My team has been observing you and conducting tests. I can understand why you're angry. I don't like causing people to suffer, but sometimes it's a necessary part of my work. Medical research. We're scientists, like you. I can't answer those questions. It's a breach of protocol for me to be speaking to you at all. Captain, please. You're exaggerating the situation. Our techniques are as benign as we can make them. Please understand that there's a purpose to our actions. The data we gather from you may help us cure physical and psychological disorders that afflict millions. Isn't that worth some discomfort? Just as your perspective would change if your people were the ones to live longer and healthier lives as a result. Don't forget, we've been observing you, Captain. I know the most important thing to you is the welfare of your crew. You'd even kill to protect them. Of course you would. You take care of your own, just as we do. We're really more similar than you care to admit. You're a remarkably strong-willed individual. I've been very impressed by your self-control over the past several weeks. We've been increasing your dopamine levels, stimulating various aggressive impulses to test your behavioural restraints. There's been a great difference of opinion about how much more strain you can bear. (Janeway slams Alzen against the wall.) I'd hoped you'd be more cooperative once you realised the importance of our work. I'm afraid that would be pointless. We're monitoring your attempts to break our control over you. You won't succeed. Consider what's in the best interests of your crew. We will be continuing our research. If you make no further attempts to interfere, I assure you that the fatality rate will be minimal, though there may be some deformities. And I would be willing to share our final data with you. If you don't, then the entire experiment and its subjects will be terminated.  [Ready room]
