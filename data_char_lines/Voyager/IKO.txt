Stay away or I'll kill her! A ship, some food. I'm not a fool. (Tuvok and Yediq enter.) IKO: You know I'll do it. Tell them. Not until I get a ship. Get back! You. This your ship? Then let me out. If you don't, I'll kill you all. Boche and Ledara. Your children. Are you sure they're safe? Thank you. Oh, my head. You're not afraid of me. You were never afraid of me. Not even when I tried to kill you. It's nice to look into someone's eyes and not see fear. [Galley] PARIS I still don't understand. Why weren't you hurt? You don't feel pain? I wish I was made of light. Doctor? My stomach. I, I can't. I can't stop thinking about the man I killed. Is that why I'm feeling sick? I've never felt guilty before. None of them made me feel like this. Why did you do this to me? I didn't feel this way until you put those nanoprobes in me. You knew this would happen, didn't you? This is some kind of punishment. Take the nanoprobes out. Please. I don't want to feel this way anymore.Â [Medical lab]SEVEN: You don't honestly believe we're responsible for his condition. Please. I'm scared. Astrometrics? What's that? When I was a child, I'd lie under the stars for hours. I'd stare at them until I could see the shapes. Faces and animals made out of stars. I named them. There was Paedos the warrior, and Gezid the beast. No matter how hard he tried Paedos could never catch Gezid. You've seen them? Then you must have seen Onella, too. The Mother. She was surrounded by sixteen smaller stars. Her daughters. If I try, I think I can remember all their names. [Cargo Bay one] What is it? It's just words and numbers. I'd rather look at the stars. What's the metal above your eye? Where did you get it? It must have hurt. I hurt people. I deserve to die. (The EMH comes out of the medical lab.)  Take back the appeal. Death is what I deserve. You say I've changed, but I look at these hands every day and I see them squeezing that man's throat. And I hear the sounds he made. I'm disgusting. You've been nothing but kind to me. Why did you lie? Why? I want to go back to my cell. Am I still sick? Then I don't want special treatment. [Cargo Bay one] Give it to him. (A prisoner across the gangway, probably Egrid.) Please. Don't! He's mine. You saw how they beat me. (Joleg gives Iko the phaser.)  She's beautiful, isn't she. And there's Paedos, still watching over her. It was kind of Captain Janeway to let you bring me here. I hope you're right. I don't know. I'm not a scientist. I don't think I'd be much help to anyone. I'd like that. (Janeway and Yediq enter with a guard.) You were the first person who wasn't afraid to look me in the eye. That's how I'd like to remember you.(Seven turns and looks at him. Iko leaves with Yediq and the guard. After a
