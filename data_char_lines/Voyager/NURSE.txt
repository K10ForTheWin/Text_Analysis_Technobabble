Please don't try to move yet. You are very ill. Are you in pain? I wasn't watching you. I was coming to give you something. I don't know if it'll help. It's a medicine. There are people who have broken from tradition and left the city. Their colony grows fruits and vegetables. They discovered quite by accident that the moss that grows on certain fruit trees has healing properties. I'm sorry for what has happened to you. The elders would say that's against the Caretaker's wishes. The Caretaker's been behaving strangely for the past several months. Abducting people, increasing the power supply. He's tripled the energy he sends us. They say we have enough stored now to run the city for five years. When we ask, we're told to trust the Caretaker's decisions. One person I knew did get to the surface. We never saw her again. The ancient tunnels that brought us here still exist. Over the years, small breaches in security barriers have appeared just large enough for someone to get through. But it still requires digging through metres of rock to get out. It would take days, maybe even weeks to break through. You have to rest. Conserve your strength.
