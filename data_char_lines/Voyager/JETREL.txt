As I stated in my message, Captain, I understand you have a Talaxian called Neelix aboard your vessel. It is a matter of utmost urgency. However, I would prefer to speak with you privately. Your life may very well depend on it. Forgive me. I am Jetrel. Doctor Ma'bor Jetrel. (Neelix leaves the bridge, very upset.)
