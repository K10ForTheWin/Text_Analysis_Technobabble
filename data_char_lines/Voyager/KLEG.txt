I am Mister Kleg, the flying instructor. Are you Lieutenant Paris? Why? It sounds to me like you need lessons in patience as well. Well, I’m please to hear it. We’ll start with a review of safety procedures. Do you have a visual display system I can access? Oh, typically about four hours. But there's no rush. Polarity thrusters? Oh, they've been known to cause accidental acceleration. According to the maintenance records, you were this vessel's chief designer. I make it a point of professional pride to research every case I'm assigned to. Are you familiar with that term, Lieutenant? Professional pride? There are protocols, Mister Paris. System by system diagnostics, pre-flight simulations. Don't worry, Lieutenant. I'm planning to spend as much time with you as you need. [Jungle - day] I thought I’d made myself clear about that. All my students complete the entire course. Well, that’s an admirable sentiment. But if I give you special treatment it wouldn’t be fair to the others who have to take this course. Besides, why stop now? You’re getting very close to becoming an adequate pilot. [Rocky Rise]  Excellent, Mister Paris. Now, come about slowly. Captain, I’d appreciate it if you didn’t interrupt my student during his examination. This is highly irregular. (Paris does a ninety degree turn on the y axis.)KLEG: You’re going much too fast. If you have any desire to pass this test, you will reduce your speed immediately. What was that? I am sorry to inform you, Mister Paris, but you have failed this examination. You will no longer be allowed to operate a vessel within Ledosian space.
