You were in danger of being pulled into the distortion. You should show a little gratitude. Supervisor Yost, Renovation Team Nova. Until tomorrow, I suggest you stay at least two million kilometres from the distortion. The rift will be closed by then. I am sorry. We have lost eleven ships to the distortion over the last year. It must be sealed. Even if there were survivors, there's no way to rescue them. The best we can do is to prevent others from being trapped. My orders are to seal the rift by this time tomorrow. If you want to attempt a rescue between now and then, the risk is yours to take, but I wouldn't advise it.(Transmission ends.) Yes? We're ready now. I'm sorry. (Transmission ends.)
