Why have you entered our space without permission? I have no intention of explaining myself to you. The fact is, you're violating our territory. We'll send a ship to rendezvous with you. If you meet the criteria, we'll consider your request. We'll discuss that when we meet. (Transmission ends.) Where is your captain? We observe rather strict protocols. I'd prefer to negotiate with the Captain. What kind of weapon systems do you possess? How do I know you aren't a heavily armed invader here to attack our settlements? Your ship is damaged and your captain incapacitated. I will accept your immediate surrender. I don't think so. I think the battle is over now. (The figure walks forward into the light.) You're a powerful little thing. I must say, you surprised me. Because I can. Does it matter? How would you propose to stop me? I'm sure you're very well-intentioned, Captain, and I'd like to be able to accommodate you but you see, I'm not really here. (The Bothan vanishes, followed by the three spaceships.) Captain's log, supplemental. We have no explanation for the mysterious disappearance of the telepathic alien. We can't even be certain that he was actually here. He seems to have left us with any number of unanswered questions. [Mess hall]
