You are allied with the Malon. They will want me. Their ships are poison. They're killing us. Nothing. We were ignorant. We attacked you. Forgive us. They're poisoning our space. We don't know why. I will show you how. I am grateful. They're here, but I must tell them you are a friend. Your communications system? (Janeway helps him tap on a console.) [Bridge] We have lived here for millions of years, undisturbed until the Malon came. We tell them they are killing us. They won't listen. We tried to stop them. They're too strong! We don't know how. Your ship is powerful, your people resourceful. We need your help. Will you help us? (The night alien is beamed away.) [Astrometrics lab] (They are watching the Malon ship spewing out vomit green gas.)
