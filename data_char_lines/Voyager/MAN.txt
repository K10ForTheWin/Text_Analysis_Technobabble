Hey, it's Tom!
Attention runabout Yellowstone. Power down your engines or we will open fire.
No, sir. No, sir, I've seen no one. Please. (The shopkeeper tries to sneak past.)
Please, please.  Thank you. Thank you. ((The sacks are empty.) Thank you, Great Sage. We're so grateful. (Neelix goes back into the Temple.) [Temple]
New man coming! Get out of my way! New prisoner! Food! Food! It's the chute!
Stop them! Get his weapon! Someone's coming! (The thieves run off as an alarm sounds.)
