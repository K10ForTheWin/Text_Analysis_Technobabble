I'm getting it shut down.
I can't get through to Engineering. (It becomes incoherent babble. Chakotay goes to his door but they don't open. He steps back, and they do. After a couple of attemps, he picks his moment and jumps through before they shut again.) [Engineering]
New man coming! Get out of my way! New prisoner! Kill him, kill him. (A fair haired man intervenes.) Food! Food! Oh, there's got to be more! (He reaches to the iris and gets zapped. He falls back. Another prisoner gets his throat slit for the food he had collected. His murderer is very casual about it all.) It's the chute! I got him! (She shoots two prisoners simultaneously. Tuvok slides down.)
Hey, it's Tom!
Please, please.  Thank you. Thank you. ((The sacks are empty.) Thank you, Great Sage. We're so grateful. (Neelix goes back into the Temple.) [Temple]
 Double check the radio relays. (The warp core is dead.)
Stop them! Get his weapon! Someone's coming! (The thieves run off as an alarm sounds.)
I've done nothing. I've done nothing. Please. Please. No, sir. No, sir, I've seen no one. Please. (The shopkeeper tries to sneak past.) All right, I'll be right there.
A bird who cannot fly.
Attention runabout Yellowstone. Power down your engines or we will open fire.
Help! Somebody help me please! Stop him! Help me! (France, the man who bumped into Torres, is smashing the pots on a stall.)
