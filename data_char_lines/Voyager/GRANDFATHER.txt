I, er seem to be lost. Just a little lost. Which medicine are you talking about? There are many medicines. Oh, that one. My spirit doesn't want that medicine. I don't think so. Now why would I want to do that? It's better where I'm going. It's more interesting. To the place where my spirit lives. They got away. Some people were shouting at me. They were going for a walk. They wanted me to come along. It's hard to follow them. Oh, God, they go to strange places. Be a good boy and go. We understand. They say you can come with us. They say you're just like we are. It's not so bad. When you get used to it, they're not so bad. They're just a lot of talk. Sometimes I wish they were more quiet, but they like to talk. Oh, I'm too tired. This is a nice place. A nice place to call home. Did you hear that? Yes, you did. There's a lot of them this time. Go away! They've got other ideas. They, they're coming for you. Call home. Lost. Home Home
