 Robertson, if that's you, I need an isolinear spanner. No, my fault. You need something? Another engineering simulation? Dinner? No, I know what dinner is. I just. Are you asking me to join you? Okay. Yes. I will, thanks. Thank you. Er, would you like to sit down? Best table in the house. I wasn't sure you'd actually show up. Well, to be honest, I thought one of my friends put you up to it. Champagne? Mind if I? I must admit I'm a little nervous. Oh, let's just say it's been a long time since I've been out on a date. Well, I guess that means we've got something in common. Garçon? (The waiter ignores him.) It's a lobster. They're a delicacy on Earth. Try it. (Chapman breaks into his lobster carefully. The EMH signals Seven to break hers with her hands. She picks it up and rips it in two. Pieces fly all over Chapman.) I'm fine, fine. It's just a little bit of exoskeleton. Maybe we should order dessert. No, no, I didn't say that. I'm just, er, I'm having a very interesting evening. Would you like to dance? I'm not much of a dancer myself, but it might be fun. Relax. Try to relax. You seem a little tense. That's handy. But maybe you could ignore your chronographic sequencer and, er, let me lead. That's better. (Seven sees another couple do a twirl, and she pulls Chapman into one. His shoulder cracks.) No, I'll be all right. I had a great time, Seven. Let's do this again, someday. (Chapman leaves.)
