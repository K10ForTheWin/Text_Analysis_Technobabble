Korenna. I should go. You know, this will only encourage me. It looks good on you. Today's important for you and I wanted to be here. I'm really happy for you. It's impossible. I can't go to the Centre. I love you, Korenna. It's just so frustrating. I can't stand being away from you all the time. Oh, I wish I could hold you right now. I'll show you. (He places his hand on her back. Then a bell sounds.) I'll see you tonight. Tomorrow night then. What happened? Some of us got away. We're leaving tonight. Come with me. Korenna, it's the only way we can be together now. Yes, I am! Leave it all behind. What's happening here is wrong, Korenna. Don't be a part of it any more. It's more than that. My uncle and his family were resettled two months ago and we haven't heard from them since. Nobody I know has had any contact with this new colony we're supposed to be going to. There are stories. I've heard that the transports don't really go anywhere, that the passengers just get vaporised in some kind of thermal sweep. Korenna, thousands of us have gone already. We're being slaughtered. Your father is lying to you. I'm sorry, but you have got to make a choice. You can't go on trying to believe in both of us anymore. Either he is right and you should never see me again, or I'm right and he is part of a terrible crime. I can show you how we're rounded up for these voluntary resettlements, how the soldiers treat Regressives who won't go quietly. I know it is hard to face, but you have to. It is too important. Now, let me show you. No! No! No! (Jareth marches Dathan out, arms held behind his back.) [B'Elanna's dream - Town square] (Dathan and the man who hit Korenna are fastened to posts.)
