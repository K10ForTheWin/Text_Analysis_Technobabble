I am Rahmin. My people are the Caatati. I apologise for our appearance and the condition of our ship. Most of our people were assimilated by the Borg over a year ago. We lost everything. A few thousand on thirty ships. All that's left from a planet of millions. Captain, I want to assure you, my people were once proud and accomplished. It pains me to have to ask this, but I have eighty eight people to care for on this vessel. We need food, medicines. Is there any way you could help us? I'm deeply grateful. If it's not too much to ask, is there any way you might also spare a small quantity of thorium isotopes? Without them, our systems can't function. You can't imagine what this means to us, Captain. Thank you.  [Engineering]
