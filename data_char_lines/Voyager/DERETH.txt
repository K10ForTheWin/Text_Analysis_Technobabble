I'm Dereth, of the Vidiian Sodality. We are gathering replacement organs and suitable bio-matter. It is the only way we have to fight the phage. I'm afraid that isn't possible. I have already bio-chemically altered the air-breathing organs and grafted them into Motura's body. They are a part of him now. But sometimes, when the need is immediate, more aggressive actions are required. You don't have to explain yourself, Motura. Quite. That can serve no useful purpose. His simulated organs are primitive. It's amazing he is still alive. (Dereth points it at Tuvok, who is very fast on the draw with his phaser.) This is set to scan only. Strange. According to my readings, you are not here. The rest of you are healthy. You are compatible for organ transplant. Your surgical knowledge is inferior. We will simply adapt his immunogenicity. It won't be a problem. Which of you will donate a lung?
