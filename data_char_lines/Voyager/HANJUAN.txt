How long will that take? Where? He's right. We should try the tether. It's better than sitting here waiting to be buried in dust. He's telling the truth. We'll take you with us. Answer him, or I'll throw you out myself. Who put you in command? I say we throw Vatm out the door. We could use the extra oxygen. Yes. Stop! What are you doing? (Vatm is at the door controls.) Let him. From lack of oxygen? How do you know it wasn't an accident? Again you take command. Again you decide our fate. How do we know you didn't kill him. Your motive would be the same as ours. Revenge. Oh, and we are expected to believe that? I'm not going out there. Where's Tuvok? Not me. Besides I wouldn't know where to look. (Neelix sees Tuvok outside the main door.) But why did he kill him?
