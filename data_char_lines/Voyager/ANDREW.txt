Is she going to be all right? Grandma? Are you awake? I brought you a present. Grandma Kes? I finally finished your birthday present. Sorry it's late, but I wanted to get it right. What do you mean? I'm Andrew, your grandson. Doctor? Doctor Van Gogh? She doesn't recognise me. I'm sorry, Captain, I have to go. Look mom, I'm almost finished with Grandma's present. I hope so. I still feel bad for not having it ready in time for her party. (Kes goes into the main living room.) Grandma, don't look. You'll spoil the surprise. Yes, listen to her. Leave her alone. Maybe, but she's not delusional. She's the smartest person I know. We should listen to her. I'm sorry I don't have a present for you, grandma. I've got an idea for something special I'm going to make, but I've been too busy with school work, I haven't had a chance to start it. Sure. I always think before I speak. You taught me that. At my physics lesson in Engineering. No, I stopped at your quarters to get you. Don't you remember? She's all yours, Doctor. Excuse me. That cake looks great.
