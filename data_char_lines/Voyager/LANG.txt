No. They're too far beneath the surface. 
Commander, there's a problem with the internal sensors on deck four. It looks like a circuit relay malfunction. It's everything I dreamed it of, sir. Another disappearance. It's Neelix. Forty.  Decks eleven through fifteen are completely shut down. Most of the remaining crew are on security detail near the cargo and shuttle bays. Twelve, sir. Where are you going? Start by reinforcing the containment fields. Reroute emergency power. We've got to seal those doors. (Too late. The Nyrians enter. Lang shoots two before being shot herself. There is another very brief battle in Engineering.) [Corridor]
 They're firing on us, Captain.
