I think we need some clarification. Just why have we been singled out for this honour? I don't have anything to learn from him. What are they going to do, put us off the ship? Keep us in the brig for seventy years? Every person on this ship is needed. Nothing's going to happen. It was ridiculous. Tuvok had Chell running laps around the cargo bay. Thank you. What are we going to be doing? That's on deck two. We'd have to crawl through over fifty Jeffries tubes to get there. My legs feel like lead pipes. How about the pain in my shoulders. (Later, Tuvok, Henley and Dalby lap a limping Chell and struggling Gerron. Finally a wilting Henley and Dalby catch up with Tuvok.) That was no run, it was a death march. Sir, we're picking up an automated distress call. Unknown. There's a lot of subspace interference. They're not responding. They're powering up weapons. We've been hit on the lateral phaser array. Shields at eighty one percent. Aye, sir. I thought we went by the book. At least we went out with our phasers firing. Retreat? Along with a lot of other things. So am I. It's getting awfully warm in here. I think he's all right.
