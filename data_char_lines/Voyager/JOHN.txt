 You are so much like your mother. [Sickbay] You kids be careful and be back before sunset. Ooo. Those fish don't stand a chance. Better get going, your cousins aren't going to wait forever. I thought you were looking forward to the hike. Just the kids, no dads to slow you down. Why would you say that? See? Now go on, have a good time. What is it? I'm going to go look for her. Yeah? B'Elanna, where have you been? You want to talk about it? You wish what? Now why would you say that? Who's everyone? Did I ever tell you what the kids at my school used to call me? I used to fall asleep in class all the time, so instead of John Torres, they called me John Snore-ez. Of course it is. Kids tease each other. They can be very cruel. But it doesn't mean that they hate you, or that they hate Klingons. I think I do. You have to learn to be a little less sensitive. Now come on. Uncle Carl's going to tell one of his famous fish stories. Suit yourself. (B'Elanna goes to one side to read a PADD, and John goes to the camp fire.) We sure did. It jumped five feet in the air. (Torres is sitting up in bed remembering all this. Later, when the kids are put to bed in their tents.)JOHN: Everybody asleep? Sure. For what? He was just doing what eleven year olds do. I'm sure B'Elanna overreacted. She's too damn sensitive. You haven't been around her much the last couple of years. She's gotten moody, unpredictable, argumentative. Just like her mother. (B'Elanna is listening.) Everything's become a fight with her. I guess the older, I get the less intensity I can handle. You know, it's funny how Mom and Dad always turn out to be right. Mom warned me not to marry Miral. Sure she did. But she never thought I had the constitution to live with a Klingon. And now I'm living with two of them. [Engineering]  B'Elanna? What are you doing?(B'Elanna is packing her bag.) [Sickbay] B'Elanna, what's wrong? No, I don't. What are you talking about? You shouldn't be listening to private conversations. B'Elanna, listen to me. Your mother and I are having problems, but that doesn't That's not true. B'Elanna. You are twisting my words, B'Elanna. [Sickbay]
