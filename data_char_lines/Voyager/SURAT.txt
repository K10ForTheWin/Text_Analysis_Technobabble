We've met before, in battle. That's a fine speech, Culluh, but what makes you think Voyager won't use this technology to defeat us? I have heard what you did to the Relora Maje and his companion. Very impressive. But before I make an enemy of these Federations, I want proof that you have their command codes. Well, Culluh, what are you waiting for? Use the command codes to disable them.  Why are you allowing them to continue firing? I hope you know what you're doing. [Bridge]  We're losing patience, Culluh. You'll stay right here. [Bridge] I don't think you ever had those command codes. I think you're a liar! You're right. We can beat them. But we're going to do it without you. We're taking your ship. (All the occupants of the room are beamed out, except for Chakotay.) [Transporter room] I will make you very sorry for this, Culluh.
Aren't you really trying to get us to relax our guard so the Trabe can conquer us again? Are you threatening us, Captain?
