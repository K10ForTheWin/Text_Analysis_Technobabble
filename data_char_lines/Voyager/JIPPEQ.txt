 I thought we agreed Central Control would be off limits. (He is a middle-aged male. Janeway has been getting her hands dirty, and wipes them on a cloth.) That technology's classified. Then consider it finished. You've turned our ship upside down for two weeks, and I've yet to see any results. Back online. I'll admit we do share some things in common. Cousins? You can access the warp assembly from here.  Warp reactors one through fourteen are coming online. It's working. Warp reaction's destabilising. Tal? So much for finger crossing. Why couldn't we detect that before? But that'll take days.  Do your officers make a habit of seducing the species they encounter? I find that difficult to believe. We don't share your cavalier attitude toward intimacy. In our society, mating is taken very seriously. When two people chose each other the bonding is permanent. They become biochemically linked. Separation is rare. It induces illness, sometimes fatal. What's to become of Tal when your Ensign flies off in search of his next conquest? [Engineering] Microfractures? That's the same problem we've been having. Sabotage? I don't believe it.  There's no point in lying. We found a schematic for the parasite on your personal database. You realise this could destroy our ship, our home? So you've resorted to sabotage, no doubt involving him. Movement? It's none of their concern. She's referring to a small group of dissidents. You're destroying the work of every generation that came before you. Our ship isn't just a collection of modules, it's an expression of unity, tradition. For the sake of our history we must respect the rights of Yes. Captain, she's a criminal. Let's get started. (Jippeq and Tal leave. Janeway nods to Tuvok and he leaves.) Tal was able to slow the parasites' growth with a polaron surge, but the junctions are still destabilising. They're unusual people. I'm initiating another polaron surge. We can destroy these parasites.
