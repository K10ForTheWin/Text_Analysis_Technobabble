You have more? How can we help someone so powerful they can create water out of thin air? Ocampa. She is Ocampa. (A slight blonde girl in a doorway.) Why would you be interested in such worthless creatures? They live only nine years. They make poor servants. We caught her when she wandered to the surface. The entity in space that gives them food and power also gives them sole access to the only water on this world, two miles below the surface. There's no way to get to them. We tried. The entity has established some kind of subterranean barrier we can not penetrate. Occasionally, some of them do find their way to the surface. We don't know how, but the Ocampa seal the tunnels afterwards. You'd be wasting your time. I've used every method of persuasion I know to get her to help us. She won't. I'd be more interested in acquiring this technology that allows you to create water from thin air. Do it. Do it! (The Kazon put down their weapons, Tuvok and Chakotay disarm Jabin.) Have you come to investigate the entity's strange behaviour too, Captain? I'm afraid I can not permit that. I have a dispute with anyone who would challenge us. And I have no intention of letting anyone with your technological knowledge board the Array. Be advised, Captain. I have called for additional ships. You can't do that! You have made an enemy today.
