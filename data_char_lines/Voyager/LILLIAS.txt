Get away or I'll kill him! Drop your weapon! Now! (Tuvok drops his phaser.) This is my shelter. These are my supplies. The carriage is damaged. What about the oxygen converters? They've been damaged too. They can't produce enough air for six people. I don't have enough rations for everyone. Don't expect me to share. Not really. I'm a foundry worker. I still can't get this power relay online. I'm not an orbital engineer. I can't do this. A name? No. Alixia. Where is your sister now? I'm sorry. I have a sister too. Halla. Three weeks ago after the first impact our home was destroyed and we were separated. I haven't seen her since. I don't even know if she's alive. Once we start going up the tether will we be able to He's opening the launch doors! He's leaving without us! You wanted to leave, fine, then leave. (Tuvok pulls Lillias away from the door controls.) He would have let us die down there. So now he wants to leave. Murdered? How? No, he's not. I can see it every time you talk to Neelix. You're dismissive and condescending. Neelix! (Sklar goes onto the roof and grapples with Tuvok, tossing him over the railing before picking up the hand phaser and removing the storage device. We are shown Tuvok hanging on to the bottom of an outer strut. Sklar goes back inside.) What are you doing! He can't. He's hurt. If we don't get moving soon the tether couplings will give out and they'll snap. We'll lose mag-lev cohesion. I can't. I don't know how. It's too dangerous. We've got to secure the tether first. The only person who knows how to pilot this ship is Neelix. I'm doing my best. I don't know how to do this. We're going to lose cohesion any minute know. But they didn't expect Voyager to intervene, so they arrived before our colonies had been evacuated What about Doctor Vatm? So that's why he tried to hide the data storage device on the roof. The damage to our world could have been much worse. Thank you. (Tuvok enters.)
