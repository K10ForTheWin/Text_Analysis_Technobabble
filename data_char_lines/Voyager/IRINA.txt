Vectored exhaust ports, accelerated driver coils. Your vessel must be fast. Check your scanners. You'll see a comet on the other side of the asteroid field. I wonder which of our ships could get there first? Are you going to accept? I think so. Does that mean youâ€™re afraid to try again? My power transformer overloaded. The one with the long handle. My co-pilot thinks so, too. I was on my way to meet him when I ran into you. It's a small trinary system about half a parsec from here. Are you always this inquisitive? Thanks. I designed it myself. Warp's fine if you like going fast in a straight line. But to me that's just physics, not flying. Anyway, for the kind of flying I'm here for, warp is not a factor. The race course is only two billion kilometres long. His name is Assan. He was a fighter pilot. One of the most ruthless. Joxom! My co-pilot. This was Assan's fault. He collided with me so many times my shield generator overloaded. Joxom's console exploded. He's lucky he's alive. [Briefing room] Your team is not responsible, Captain. My generators were already overloading when they made contact. No. If we stop now we'll be letting these extremists win. I appreciate the gesture, but my ship's damaged. Apparently I can't. [Delta Flyer] We must have missed something. At this rate, we're going to be out of the race in a couple of minutes. No! It could damage the reactor coils. These systems are different than what you're used to. Of course I do. I'm more familiar with my ship than you are. I think it's the injector ports. I'm sorry, Harry. I really am.  If we're going to just sit here, we might as well see who's winning. Admit it, Harry. You're curious too. Good for them. [Delta Flyer] How far from the finish line? All congregated in the name of peace. Touching, isn't it? Not everyone is as comfortable mixing with other species as you are, Harry. Some of us believe it was better when we were separate. [Delta Flyer]  They're moving again.
