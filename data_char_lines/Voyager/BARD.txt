Oh, those many years ago, the people's hearts were sad and low. Then the Sages to the city came. They came upon a burning flame just as the Seers said they would. They lifted Takar's blinding hood. Well? What did you think? Nice? I'll wager you've never heard the Song of the Sages more beautifully or faithfully recited. As you know, the first verse is free, but the next verse will cost you three frangs. Oh, but I need money for ointment for my eye. Please, gentlemen! Who are you? You are another Holy One, aren't you? Then you'll appreciate this. The Sages in the sky did dwell upon white clouds that held them well. Until the sentry rang the bell, the Holy Sages never fell. That'll be three frangs, please. Well, you heard it, didn't you? No, please, sir! My eye Sir? Wait, please. I'll throw in another verse gratis. But when the ringing called them here, from the sky they did appear. Oh, let me see now. The final verse. It's been a very long time, you know. Those are very handsome shoes you have, sir. (Chakotay takes his shoes off.) Ah, yes, it's coming back to me now. And there, amid the eastern lights, three new stars appeared that night. And with the ringing of the bell, the Sages knew where they must dwell. The Holy Pilgrim led them back, high into the sky of black, and riding on the wings of fire, the Holy Men rose higher and higher. Wait a minute. I know who you are. (That evening, Neelix walks up the temple steps.)
