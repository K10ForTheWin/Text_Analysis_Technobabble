 Excuse me, gentlemen. You've entered a restricted area. Captains and above. I'm going to have to ask you to come with me. All unauthorised personnel are to be debriefed by Starfleet Intelligence. Direct orders from Admiral Bullock. I'm sorry, Commander. (Gentry has pulled out his phaser.) Where am I? What starship? Why have you brought me here? I'll be reporting this incident to the Admiral. Gentry, David. Rank, Ensign. Starfleet service number nine nine beta three two seven eight. Planet of origin, Earth. Gentry, David. Rank, Ensign. Starfleet service number nine nine beta three two seven eight. What are you doing? Why? Gentry to Headquarters. Security alert! No! Don't touch me. Disease! Humans! (Gentry collapses.)
