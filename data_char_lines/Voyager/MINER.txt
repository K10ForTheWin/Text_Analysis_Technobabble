I want my iridium back now. I've scanned your ship. I know you've got it on board. You mean thief. He was here two days ago. He sold us three thousand induction units. He was gone a day before we realised he'd also stolen twenty kilos of ore. How? Will you return my iridium? All I can tell you is that the induction units came from a planetoid called Velos.
