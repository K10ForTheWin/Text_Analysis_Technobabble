You'll wait your turn, young man. What may I serve you, my lord? I see. Beatrice? Musical? Yes, my lord. Come. Everything was fine until you came here. I took care of him. He trusted me. But when you arrived, all that changed. You've done nothing but cause trouble. We don't want more trouble in our lives! (Two women fight.) [Sickbay]
The drawing room is in here. (A housemaid opens the door and the efficient housekeeper enters, followed by Janeway in corset and crinoline.) Bridget, take Mrs Davenport's cape, and tell Lord Burleigh that she's here. There's tea. (Bridget leaves.) Tea is usually served at five thirty and dinner's at eight thirty. His lordship doesn't appreciate being kept waiting. Let's make something clear, Mrs Davenport. My job is to make sure that this household runs smoothly. I have been with Lord Burleigh for nearly twenty years because this household runs smoothly. He has come to trust me, and I will not brook any behaviour that might jeopardise that trust, so you will be expected to follow the rules that I have set down. You would be wise not to make an enemy of me. I can make sure we have another governess by next week. One lump or two? Lord Burleigh will be here directly. (Mrs Templeton leaves Janeway to look around. She goes to close a window flapping in the storm and sees a reflection in the glass. Janeway turns to gaze at a portrait of a woman. Someone puts a hand on her shoulder and she jumps.)
