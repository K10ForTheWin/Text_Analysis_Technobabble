Congratulations, Captain. Against our better judgment the B'omar Sovereignty has agreed to grant your vessel passage through our territory. However, there are a few stipulations. Guidelines that you must adhere to. We expect nothing less. While in our space, your vessel will not exceed warp three, and your weapons systems will remain offline. You will avoid unnecessary scans and you will not conduct surveys of any kind. You will make no attempt to explore our space and you will avoid all communications with non-military craft. There are a total of seventeen checkpoints where you will submit your vessel for inspection. Definitely not. You'd pass directly through the Agrat-mot Nebula. A key resource in our trade negotiations with the Nassordin. Captain, what is happening here? Borg. You have Borg on your ship? Then why is she equipped with Borg shields? Let's tally the events, shall we? First, you arrive uninvited and unwelcome, requesting a shortcut through our space. Then you proceed to unleash some sort of rogue Borg and now you want us to help you get it back. Captain Janeway, after what I've seen here, I question your competence. Your Borg will be dealt with quickly and efficiently. It's being tracked as we speak. The Borg will be found and destroyed. There will be no sharing of information. From this point on, your vessel will maintain a distance of at least five light years from our borders. Any deviation will be considered an act of aggression. You're committing an act of war, Captain. Reinforcements are arriving. You will be destroyed.
