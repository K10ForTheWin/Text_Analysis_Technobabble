Fine, sir. Hungry. Not much. I was working in the holodeck, and then I was here. No, sir. No. What's going on?
I heard the Captain. No. No problem. It's just that I'm used to taking orders from B'Elanna, that's all. And to tell you the truth, she doesn't I'm picking up a fluctuation in the alien ship's power source. I'm working on it. It's systems are overloading. Yes, sir. [Sickbay] No luck. Actually, I think that should do it. My god. That's Crell Moset. He killed my brother, my grandfather, hundreds of people. He's a mass murderer! It's no mistake. Moset performed experiments on living people. Thousands of Bajorans were killed in his so-called hospital. The liar!  I can still remember the sounds his instruments made. The screams of his patients. The smell. Chemicals and dead flesh. He operated on my grandfather. Exposed his internal organs to nadion radiation. It took six days for him to die. I promised myself I would never forget. My memory's just fine. He blinded people so he could study how they adapted. Exposed them to polytrinic acid just to see how long it would take for their skin to heal. By infecting hundreds of people so that he could experiment with different treatments. Old, helpless people like my grandfather, because he considered their lives worthless. Everybody knew. I was there. We may not be able to do anything about the real Moset, Commander, but the programme should be destroyed. Every trace of that man's research should be deleted from the database. [Sickbay] Commander. I have the right to resign my commission. Moral objections to the ship's medical policy. You don't have the right to violate the memory of my family. As long as that Cardassian hologram is online that's exactly what you're doing. It is to me. Crell Moset killed thousands of people in his hospitals. As long as we're willing to benefit from his research, we're no better than he is. [Briefing room]
