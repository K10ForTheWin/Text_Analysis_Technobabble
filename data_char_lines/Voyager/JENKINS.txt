Same as it was twenty minutes ago. Current speed warp six point three, heading oh twenty one mark two. Permission to speak freely, sir? We're on the night shift. Relax. It's an automated distress call. A class M planet, range point seven three light years, bearing two six one mark one five. The burden of command is on your shoulders, sir. Of course, we could always wake Commander Chakotay. I'm not picking up on any lifesigns. I guess they didn't make it. Current speed, warp five, heading oh twenty one, mark three. Nothing to report. Permission to speak freely, sir. People have been talking about you. Rumour has it you were the one who outsmarted the smart bomb. Understood.
