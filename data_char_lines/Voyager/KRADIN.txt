Offer no opposition, or you will be nullified. [Ready room] Be still! Vori soldiers! You are surrounded. Lay down your arms and Hold your fire, Commander Chakotay. Do not fire, Commander. I am Lieutenant Tuvok, I've come to take you back to Voyager. I assure you, Commander, this is no ruse. It is Lieutenant Tuvok. Don't you recognise me? They've brainwashed you, Commander. Look closer. Try to recall. Your shuttle was shot down. These people, the Vori, they captured you. (The Kradin sounds more like Tuvok, but still looks Kradin.)
