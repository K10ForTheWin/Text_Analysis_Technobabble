Is there a genetic match? Could this be it? The proof? Opposable thumb. Multiple articulation of the digits, as expected from a technologically advanced species. He had no sense of smell? Non-saurian? Doesn't that weaken our case? Was he on an expedition? Did he have a ship? Crewmates? Possibly a military uniform. I'll contact our supporters at the Circle of Archaeology. They might be able to spare a research vessel, perhaps a few assistants. Professor, don't you think that's a little precipitous? Well done, Professor. What do we do now? I met with the Circle of Exobiology. They're concerned. There have been rumours. The Ministry has seized your research and they're planning to detain you. Heresy against Doctrine. It's too late. Your supporters are frightened. No one will back you. I'm not leaving you, Professor. A name? Was that wise? I hope you gave her my regards. No, Professor, I would never presume. It's the plasma signature. Scanners have found a match. A ship ninety light years away. There are one hundred forty eight lifeforms aboard, travelling at warp six point two. Done. I have an image. What do we say to them? Entering portation range. Curious. I didn't expect the smell. Courting behaviour? There's no sign of vasodilatation in their skin. It's obviously hierarchical, with clear differences in status and rank. The males appear to be subordinate to that female. Perhaps a matriarchy. What's wrong? Professor? We should make contact. Explain ourselves. Yes, Minister. I have had that privilege. That is correct. It is flawed, Minister. Yes. I've reviewed all of his research, including data from the Voyager's computer. I've checked and rechecked the procedures. I now believe that we were overzealous. We saw an evolutionary connection when in fact there was none.
