Good. I can be warm and sensual. Do you always fly at women at warp speed, Mister Paris? That's our ship. That's Voyager. (It is docked at an upper pylon.) Intrepid class. Sustainable cruise velocity of warp factor nine point nine seven five. Fifteen decks. Crew complement of one hundred and forty one. Bio-neural circuitry. Some of the traditional circuitry has been replaced by gel packs that contain bio-neural cells. They organise information more efficiently, speed up response time. (The shuttlecraft flies past Voyager.)  [Quark's, Deep Space Nine] (Morn is in his usual seat.) Course entered, Ops has cleared us. Sequence underway. New heading, four one mark one eight zero. Not until we clear the plasma field, Captain.
