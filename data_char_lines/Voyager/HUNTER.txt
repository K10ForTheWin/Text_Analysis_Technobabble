 The prey's course has become erratic. I will intercept to kill. This prey is resilient. We will lose the moment. Direct hit. Our hull armour is stable. The prey is heading for an asteroid belt, vector one six eight point nine. We are losing him. Tracking. He's holding position above an asteroid and he's left his ship.  The prey is scattering our sensors. Compensating. For what reason?
