You will reverse course immediately. This region is in dispute. You have no business in Krenim space. The Zahl have no legitimate claim here. They have taken what is ours. Reverse course or be destroyed. No discussion! No compromise! (Transmission ends.) You've ignored our warnings, and now you consort with our enemy. Your presence in our space is provocation enough. State your identity. And your reason for violating our borders? No. You will submit to the Krenim Imperium. I would prefer to seize your vessel before it is too badly damaged. Surrender now and I will forego the execution of your crew. Then prepare to be boarded. (Transmission ends.) You've entered Krenim space. State your identity. This region is in dispute. I suggest you avoid our territory. Good journey.
