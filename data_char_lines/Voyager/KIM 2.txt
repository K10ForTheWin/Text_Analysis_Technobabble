Captain, there was a minor spatial fluctuation on the Bridge. But it was only there for a millisecond. At first, we thought it was a sensor aberration, but they were in perfect calibration at the time. As strange as it sounds, Captain, according to these readings, another Voyager's right here, right now, occupying the same point in space time we are. Captain? We could rig a portable phase discriminator. It might protect her from the spatial transition. I think so, Captain. And I've rigged a phase discriminator. Kes should be able to go back safely. [Voyager 2 - Engineering] JANEWAY This should protect you from the spatial transition. [Voyager 2 - Corridor] JANEWAY  Okay, I've managed to re-establish a comm. link with the other Voyager. Three hundred and forty seven, and more are boarding. I've got an incoming subspace signal. It's from the other Voyager. They must've re-established the comm. link. But Captain. No! Doc, am I glad to see you. No. Actually, the Captain's put the ship on self-destruct. She ordered me to take the baby and go to the other Voyager. Goodbye, Doc. Will do. [Voyager 2 - Bridge] (Vidiians enter.)
