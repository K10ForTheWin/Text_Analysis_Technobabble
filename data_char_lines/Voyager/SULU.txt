Return fire! Damage report. Seal that conduit! Outstanding. I may have to give you a promotion. Mister Tuvok, if you're going to remain on my ship, you're going to have to learn how to appreciate a joke. And don't tell me Vulcans don't have a sense of humour, because I know better. Very good. And thanks again. Visual. My God! (A purple shockwave is heading towards them.) Shields! Shields! (Impact. Everyone is thrown to the deck.) Starboard thrusters! Turn her into the wave! Quarter impulse power. Damage report. Don't tell me that was any meteor shower. Praxis is their key energy production facility. Helm, set a course for Kronos, maximum warp. Take us through the Azure Nebula. That should conceal our approach. That's right. Do you have a problem with that, Ensign? Objection noted. Resume your station. A pretty bold statement for an Ensign with only two months space duty under his belt. Ensign, you're absolutely right. But you're also absolutely wrong. You'll find that more happens on the bridge of a starship than just carrying out orders and observing regulations. There is a sense of loyalty to the men and women you serve with. A sense of family. Those two men on trial, I served with them for a long time. I owe them my life a dozen times over, and right now they're in trouble, and I'm going to help them. Let the regulations be damned. You better believe it. Helm, engage. On screen. Red alert! All hands to battle stations! On screen. Thank you, Kang. Kang, we've been on a survey mission studying this nebula. Our navigation system malfunctioned, and I'm afraid we got lost. As soon as we've completed repairs, we'll be on our way. Very generous of you, but we can manage. Actually, an escort would be welcome. We'd hate to lose our way again. Nice to see you again, Kang. (Transmission ends.) Man your station, Lieutenant. We're not giving up just yet. Helm, come about. Tactical status. Ensign Tuvok, what is the composition of this nebula? Sirillium? That's a highly combustible substance, isn't it? Is there any way we could ignite the sirillium? Like tossing a match into a pool of gasoline. Would their shields withstand the blast? That's all the time we need. Tuvok, modulate a positron beam and stand by. We'll ignite the sirillium the instant we clear the nebula. Helm, prepare to engage maximum warp on my command. All hands, this is the Captain. Secure stations and batten down the hatches. On my mark, Ensign. Mister Tuvok, light the match. (Whoomph! Kang's ship is sent tumbling by the exploding gas.) Helm, set a course for Kronos. Engage. Commander Rand, I want you Maintain course. (Boom!) Return fire! Switch to manual! (to Janeway) Who the hell are you? Intruder alert! Get Security up here. I asked you a question. Who are you, and what are you doing on my ship? Ensign. Do you know this woman? I'll reroute auxiliary power to structural integrity. Take those two to the brig. [Excelsior turbolift] Helm, set a course for Kronos. Engage. Who's at Communications? Where is she? Maintain course. (Boom!) Return fire! Switch to manual!
