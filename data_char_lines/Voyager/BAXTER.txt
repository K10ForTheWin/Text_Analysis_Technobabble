It started acting up a couple of days ago. I'd been working out in the gym, maybe I overdid it. Yes. Can this guy do everything a real doctor does? (The EMH hands a device to Kes.) If I had to get treatment for something serious, if I needed surgery for instance, would he be performing it? I don't know. I'd have to think twice about that. Not bad. Thanks. (Baxter leaves.) [Doctor's office] I tried a new hamstring exercise. Maybe I overdid it. But my workouts are about all that stand between me and a severe case of cabin fever. Well, you see, I need to work out. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. (Baxter leaves.)
