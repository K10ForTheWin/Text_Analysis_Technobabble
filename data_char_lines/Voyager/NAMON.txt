We found him in the trunks, a hundred footfalls past Grove Yellow. None, sir. We didn't ask. No, sir, but he doesn't bear Vori colours either. I hadn't fathomed that, sir. I'm not certain what he is, sir. Yes, sir. No, sir. None but the nemesis! I'm sorry, sir. Rafin's never glimpsed the face of the nemesis either. Have you, Rafin? You'll glimpse them in the soon after. When you do, you'll fathom there's no heart thumping beneath their flesh. How many beasts will you send to the Wayafter, Rafin? So I ask you again, Rafin. How many will you nullify? You've got the trembles. If you don't wrestle your trembles to rages, ally, the nemesis'll nullify you. I'll walk with the stranger, sir. If any beast comes to clash, I'll nullify the beast. Then the nemesis you nullified wasn't half so beastly as the Kradin. In their glimpsers, we're less than nothing. They flame our homes, take our plantings, make playthings of our sisters. If you were a Vori you'd crave to drive them from this sphere just as I do. You don't fathom the nemesis. Beg the power you believe in that you never will. The light will be old soon. We'd be sharp to cluster with the others. You'd be sharp to do my tellings. No, wait. I pledged to walk with you. Glimpse there.(A piece of debris on the ground.) You'll have to make the walk with us to the Seventh Contingent. (Two very alien people shoot at Namon, hitting him in the shoulder. He shoots one as he falls. Chakotay knocks the other down and grabs its weapon.)
