The Vinculum, you have it? You've made a terrible mistake, Captain. [Engineering] Yes. Since the Borg decimated our world, we've been looking for ways to retaliate. Thirteen of my people were injected with the virus. They allowed themselves to be assimilated so that the virus would spread to this Vinculum. Once another Borg ship had retrieved it they would be infected as well. Then another Cube, and another. We had the opportunity to infect dozens, even hundreds of Borg vessels until you interfered. Why? It wasn't designed to infect other species. We designed that virus to destroy Borg, Captain. We never considered a treatment. I'm afraid your drone won't survive. But we must return the Vinculum to the debris field immediately. If the Borg arrive first, we'll have lost our chance, and those thirteen people will have died in vain. We don't have time for this. The Vinculum, Captain. You scanned our vessel, you're aware of our firepower. The Vinculum survived the destruction of one ship. What makes you so sure it won't survive another? [Sickbay]
