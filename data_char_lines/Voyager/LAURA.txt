Siral, over here. I was hoping you'd come. It's great to see you. (He is hugged by a human woman.) Shouldn't you be off sharpening your teeth? (Korok leaves.) I was assimilated at Wolf three five nine. It's good to see you again. But you look out of place. Your cybernetic implants. Eleven more drones, three hundred metres. [Forest] Our ships are scattered across the galaxy. Most of us will be the only drone on board who knows about this place. Will there be anything left?
