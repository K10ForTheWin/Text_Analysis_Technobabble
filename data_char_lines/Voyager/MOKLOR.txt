Do you come to have your honour challenged? Are you willing to see the ceremony through to the end? It will be a lengthy ordeal. First, you must eat from the heart Then how do you expect to distinguish yourself? Huh. A pitiful reply. Let us proceed. A warrior must endure great hardship. To test your mettle you will endure the ritual of twenty pain-sticks. After that, you will engage in combat with a master of the bat'leth. Finally, you will traverse the sulphur lagoons of Gorath. Not until you have completed the ceremony, p'tach. (They jab Torres withÂ pain sticks. She gasps and falls to her knees, then attacks Moklor.)
