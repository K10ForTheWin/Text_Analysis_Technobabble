 No! No!(A Borg reaches for the little girl.) [The Raven]
I won't crash it. Ah ha. Are we going to see the Borg? Do the Borg have kids, too? What do they look like? Cy-ber-netic? MAGNUS: Mmm hmm.ANNIKA: Are they friendly? I hope so, too, Daddy. MAGNUS I can't sleep. Is he special? Does the Queen have a throne? Bye. (The drone is beamed away.) Me. Papa? Are we going to be assimulated? Are the Borg mad at us? Then why are they chasing our ship? Can't we go home? Papa, will it hurt to be a drone?
