Yes. There were thousands of them, little ships, swarmed around my freighter, covered every square metre of the hull. Then they began extracting energy from all the ship's systems. We had no defence. Then they boarded us. I don't know what they used. It was painful, people screaming, dying. We were in their space. That was enough. Captain, the rest of my crew, is there anyone else? We come from Mislan, five parsecs from here in a yellow dwarf system. If you pass it will you tell our people? It happened so quickly.
