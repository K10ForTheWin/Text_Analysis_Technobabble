Unknown. It comes from across the galaxy. It's on a course to one of our modules. Pitiful relics. I've located their ship. It's four thousand ketriks from the module. The rest of the group is on its way. We may not be able to take them alone. We need the strength of the others. Yes. But now is not the time for it. We should wait until the others arrive and take the ship. If there's a battle, we must join it. Perhaps you are more interested in collecting relics. Perhaps your judgment is clouded. I can't. The gravity well is pulling us in. (Tuvok grabs the blade and slashes the Beta across the throat, then attacks the Alpha. He throws Tuvok into the bulkhead.)BETA: That vessel is weakening the module's containment field. No response. [Bridge]
No doubt he found the nearest hole and crawled into it. Forty three Hirogen died because of your incompetence and cowardice. Capable prey make the hunt more challenging. You did enough damage giving us defective technology to begin with. Keep away from me. Why am I here? The Alpha? What about the holograms that attacked us? I'll need to contact my people and resume the hunt. We'll be the ones doing the killing this time. Who are you to question our abilities? Are you suggesting that we let them escape? A coward's tactic. Am I? The holograms are prey. They should be hunted down, not deactivated like machines. Is this female your Alpha now? Prisoners. No closer or he dies. Tell them to drop their weapons. We don't share tracking technology.  I've lost them. There's too much radiation. They'll come out eventually. We'll wait. Still nothing. The other hunting vessel is hailing. They've detected the holograms on the far side of the nebula. Voyager. [Bridge]  The hologram's vessel and everything in its database are Hirogen property. I will not leave them behind. You and your crew would have made worthy prey, Captain.
