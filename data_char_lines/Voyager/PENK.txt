Your comrade from the shuttle? I'm afraid he was injured in the explosion. Certainly. You will learn nothing is more important to me than the comfort and happiness of my fighters. (The next voice usually comes from under a Klingon forehead - J G Hertzler.) Quiet! He's envious because I've found a new favourite. Aggressive. I like that. (Tuvok is helped into the room.) That can be arranged. You haven't won a single bout, and already you're making demands like a champion. Will you fight? Spoken like a true competitor, willing to ignore his injuries for the sake of the contest. Schedule a bout for him. A Red Match against the Pensarkan. But you might. Yes. We should start you off slowly. I wanted to be the first to congratulate you. Exactly. There's a great deal of hostility toward the Borg in this sector. Whenever the Pendari landed a blow, our audience grew. We're getting tens of thousands of requests to see you fight again. I agree. There's a Red Match scheduled for the day after tomorrow. The Pendari was supposed to compete, but I've entered you in his place. If three billion people paid to see you hurt, imagine how many will pay to see you die. (Penk leaves.) It's time. This is not a convenient time. You'll have to be more specific. The Borg drone and her friend. I'm afraid she's occupied at the moment. A fighter. I respect that. But you're no match for me.
