Deactivated. We are the Borg. Seven of Nine. A Borg designation. (The young girl speaks.) We've matured long enough. Don't listen to her. Irrelevant. Don't tell her anything. SEVEN; This vessel has been severely damaged. You won't be able to repair it alone. I can help you, but first you must release the hostages. That wasn't the agreement. No modifications. We show you the hostages, you give us the deflector. Comply. Comply! If she tries to resist, assimilate her. [Cube - corridor]  Why are you here? We've already negotiated. You've seen the hostages. Now give us the deflector as agreed. Irrelevant! The deflector, now. No! Give it to us. Clarify. You have two hours. Two hours or your hostages die. Don't come back here, Captain. [Bridge] I thought we agreed, no irrelevant discussions. What is the punishment for disobeying the protocols? Return to your station. [Ready room] These delays are intentional. This data's flawed. Ignore her. She's trying to divide us. We've managed so far. We're Borg. You've forgotten what that means. Thirty eight minutes. You're wasting time. (An alarm sounds.)ICHEB: Another maturation chamber is malfunctioning. (The foetus is in distress.) It's Borg. It will adapt. No. The drone is part of our Collective. Can you identify this? You tried to deceive us. (The children step aside to reveal an unconscious Kim.)LEADER: Nanoprobes were injected into his bloodstream. He won't survive without medical attention. Call your Captain. Tell her to give us the deflector. No more delays. No more deceptions. The deflector. Resistance is futile. [Bridge] LEADER We've talked enough. Your requests are irrelevant. Comply or we'll assimilate the others. Now. They'll come for us. Ignore her. It's another lie. Return to your station. It's another deception. She's manipulating us. It's a mistake. Then we'll assimilate more species. Prove we're worthy. [Bridge] What do you know about real lives? Adapt! [Bridge] No! (The Leader pulls Seven away from the control panel and puts the shields back up. Then he grabs an object and goes to hit Seven over the head with it. Icheb stops him.) Get back to your station. Do what I say. I protected you. Gave you order. Their feedback pulse is overloading the induction grids. No! Assist me. (An explosion sends an electric charge through the Leader.) We have to resist. The Collective will come for us. We are Borg.
