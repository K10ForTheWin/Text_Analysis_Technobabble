The Continuum's a dangerous place for all of us right now, not to mention a solitary human female. I admire your bravery. I'm afraid the time for diplomacy has passed, madam. If we don't end this war quickly, the damage to subspace will be irreversible. Most certainly. That's why we intend to bring this war to a conclusion by the most expedient means possible. Quite simple, really. Since Q is the ringleader of this so-called freedom faction, we shall have to execute him. We are already resolved, madam. I'd be greatly in your debt if you'd tell me where we can find him. No, I didn't think you would. Fortunately, we won't be needing your assistance. Grovel all you want, Q. I've been waiting for this moment for an eternity. Put them both in chains. Collaborating with the enemy, which in the Continuum is a crime punishable by death. [Q Continuum - Confederate camp] (Morning.) Do you have any last words? Q, do you have anything to add? A very touching speech, Q. But as usual, your rhetoric fails to compensate for your irresponsibility. (A drum roll, and the firing squad line up.) Ready! Aim! Fire! (Gunfire. Q tenses.) Cease fire! Cease fire!
