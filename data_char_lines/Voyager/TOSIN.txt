The warp plasma, where is it? You'll live for today. No guarantees about tomorrow. Give me the plasma. Slowly. (Neelix hands over the container, and Tosin scans it.) Twenty parts per million isonucleic residue? This is contaminated. You promised me a pure sample. What? (laughs) Little man, your days have ended. Then you will die with me, little man. Re-engage the safety nodes. No! Don't! (Everyone dives for cover as he ignites the green plasma particles and incinerates himself.) [Sickbay]
