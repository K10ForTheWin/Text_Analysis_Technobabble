You should know. You're half Klingon. This is the Barge of the Dead. Our dishonoured souls are being taken to Gre'thor. That's what I thought. Just a foolish superstition. Imagine my surprise. That was the naj, the dream before dying. When we can't accept that we've died, we create the illusion of life to hold on to. No, he slaughtered the dream. He dragged you from the illusion of life. This is where you belong. It's the Kos'Karii. They'll try to lure you to them. Don't listen. It's not your friends. (A Klingon jumps overboard, to be eaten by sea monsters.)HIJ'QA: There are things here worse than death.
