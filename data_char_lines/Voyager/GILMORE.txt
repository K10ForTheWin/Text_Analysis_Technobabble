But, but we're the only humans in the Delta Quadrant. Just a little post-traumatic stress syndrome. A few. Well, thank you. Such a clean ship. I mean, I'm used to falling bulkheads and missing deck plates. Unless I stay. You said you could use someone with my engineering abilities. If one of those fissures opened up in here, where would we take cover? Do I look worried? (She hears the alien noise.) Emergency stop! [Corridor]  If you don't mind I think I'd rather take the Jefferies tube. We don't know when they'll break through again. We may not last that long. What we have left of them. I'm afraid we only have a few isograms. Can I make a suggestion? Let's forget about the primary systems. They're too badly damaged. Let's focus on supplies. We picked up a few items I think might come in handy. Two kilotons of kemacite ore, a dozen canisters of mercurium. Could you use a synaptic stimulator? It's a neural interface you wear behind your ear. It taps into your visual cortex and shows you different alien vistas. Just think of it as a poor man's holodeck. Beats checkers. The Ponea gave it to us. We called them the life of the Delta Quadrant. They see every First Contact as an excuse to throw a party. I wish that we had encountered more species like that. You're the first friendly faces we've seen in months. I'm glad we found you. We were experimenting with ways to enhance our warp drive. It doesn't work. It won't work. We tried for months. Oh, hello there. That's right. Is that so? I'm glad to be here. Thank you, Miss Wildman. I'll keep that in mind. I didn't realise that you had children on board. I have a nephew back on Earth the same age. Well, not any more. I guess he's a teenager by now. I probably wouldn't even recognise him. Yes, Captain. On my way. Duty calls. (Gilmore leaves.) What happens to Voyager? Understood.  What's going to happen to us? To be honest, I'm glad you stopped us. Living the rest of my life knowing what we've done I don't know. When the Captain ordered me to modify the warp core, I concentrated on the work. I tried not to think about how it was going to be used. Commander? Yes. You said you wanted to learn more about humanity. I guess we're not exactly prized examples. I'm sorry.  One of their crew tried to dismantle the antimatter injectors. Repairs are underway. [Equinox Bridge] Marla to Bridge. We're ready.  The power relays are offline. They've been encoded. [Equinox Sickbay] No, just landscapes. Why?  We're receiving a subspace transmission. I can't tell. I can't. They're not down there.  Direct hit. Minor damage.  We lost all phaser banks.  Weapons are down! Aye, sir.  They're retreating. Fifty thousand kilometres, closing fast. They're within range. They're charging weapons. I'm sorry. (Gilmore escorts Ransom off the bridge.) I know. I'm with you, sir. Let's find a way to end this.  They're deflecting our targeting scanners. Aye, sir.
