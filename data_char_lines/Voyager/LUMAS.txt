 There are over two hundred people on our three ships alone. Everyone of them suffers from malnourishment, but it's been hardest on the children. Every parent sacrifices for their child, but even so, there's not enough food. If you could hear the crying of the babies, you would have as much trouble sleeping at night as I do. Of course, but we haven't been welcomed anywhere. Because we have no resources everyone treats us like vagrants, even criminals.
