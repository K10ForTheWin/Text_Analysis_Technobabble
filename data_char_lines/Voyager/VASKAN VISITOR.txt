I have a question about that history. How can you prove that it's true? Some musty fossils and a recreation? That doesn't prove anything. You're trying to blame the Vaskans for all your troubles the way you always do. I don't have a problem with your species. I have Kyrian friends. But I don't appreciate seeing my people being portrayed as villains in your little simulation, and I certainly don't want your history taught to my children. Another fossil. And what if those words tell a different story? What then? I'm sure you will.(The Vaskan leaves.) We know about the hologram. This museum's filled with lies. We've listened long enough!
