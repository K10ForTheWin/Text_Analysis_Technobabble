The laziest, you mean. Same old song. You're not paying them, are you? Oh, don't tell me none of them are working. Ignorant, lobeless fools! Ha! Ha! That'll be ten frangs. That's all for today. You may return tomorrow. Captain's log, supplemental. The away team has returned with some very disturbing observations about the situation on the planet. [Briefing room] Hmm? Down? Profits are down? Both of you leave me alone. Can't you see I'm trying to conduct business here? I'm sorry, Arridor. It's just that they can't get enough of my lobes. Where were we? Oh, yeah, profits are down? What are you looking at me for? Ask that idiot Kafar. He's in charge of collections in the Ga'nah Province. Huh. He does not. Then why are profits down, you idiot? Where's our money? Oh, I told you to stop calling me (Then Arridor and Kol are beamed away. Kafar looks around then settles down on Kol's chaise-longue.) [Transporter room] The Federation? This is an outrage. We won't allow you to tr We've been kidnapped, snatched from the embrace of bliss. It's all over. No more limitless profits. No more unquestioning adulation of the masses. No more quadruple lobe rubs. You mean we really are the Sages? Tell us, Arridor. Tell us! That was beautiful. We did it, Arridor. We won. [Briefing room] No more unexpected beam-outs. Ah! And make it quick! (Kafar opens a small door within the bigger door.) You mean the Grand Nagus is coming here too? We're ruined. That's coming out of your half. Hey, wait a minute. I don't think that Wait a minute. There's only 285 Rules of Acquisition. All? The least you can do is let us keep the females. (Neelix picks up two sacks of coins.) What are we going to do? Panic? Oh. I told you there was no rule. The unwritten rule? That's a very good rule. If you say so. (Kol enters carrying a large sword.) Ex-Grand Proxy! What? A likely story. Doesn't that hurt? He really isn't a Ferengi. And stay out! (Neelix leaves.) We won! We won! The Holy Pilgrim? Who's the Holy Pilgrim? What do they mean, lead us back? He's a fraud, I tell you. Hey! What do you think you're doing? We are your gods. This is outrageous. This is outrageous. We are your gods, your sages. This mustn't happen. (As two men approach with burning torches, Neelix is tied to the two Ferengi.)  Arridor? We had seven years of pure profit. This is outrageous. We'll sue! [Bridge] It was lovely doing business with you. What is it? Do something! Shields are at maximum! They're offline! Aaaaaa! (The little shuttle disappears down the wormhole.) [Bridge]
