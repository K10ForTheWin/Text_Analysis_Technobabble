Ambassador Ves Alkar, and my mother, Sev Maylor. Counsellor, it's imperative that I speak to the Captain. She hasn't been feeling well. Could she be taken to quarters? Mother, go with her. I am grateful for the Federation's offer to escort me, but if I arrive at Rekag-Seronia on board the Enterprise, the armed flagship of Starfleet, my mission as negotiator of peace will be compromised. There must be a Federation transport ship somewhere in the area that could take me there. I believe the attack on us was an isolated incident, nothing more. Thank you, sir. Then I have no choice. I understand, sir. I believe in a strong connection between body and mind. You obviously share the same convictions. I don't know about that. I think maybe my biggest asset is patience. I let everybody else talk until they're exhausted, and when I start, they're too tired to argue. Neither can I. I won't know that until I get there. I tend to feel my way through a situation. [Turbolift] Deck nine. If I were empathic like you, I'd have a real advantage. Only with each other, not other species. So, I don't have any idea what you might be feeling just now. Tell me, Counsellor, have you ever been involved in diplomatic negotiations? I'm sure. I could use some of that help. Would you come with me when we reach Seronia? Good. I hope to see you again. (the door opens) Mother, I told you that I'd be gone for over an hour. Mother, please, come in. Mother. come in please. You should lie down. [Troi's office] She was ill. I should never have brought her along. She was ninety three. She'd lived a long life. I should be grateful for that. Counsellor, there's a funeral meditation. Part of our rituals. As an empath, you're the only person on board who could perform it with me. This meditation is one of our most sacred ceremonies. Hold the stone like this. Rohm gah sevi rohm. Say after me. An end to grief. An end to pain. Strength comes from love. And courage from wisdom. Thank you. [Troi's quarters] (Deanna checks herself in a mirror. Is that a wrinkle? ) Deanna. Come in, please. Nothing that can't wait. Would you like something to drink? About? There's not much to know. I lead a very simple life. Extremely. That depends on a lot of things. It can be. Deanna. I'm sorry. If I led you to believe? You are very beautiful, but our relationship can't be like that. [Turbolift] (spurned and angry, Troi paces the lift. A tall young man enters) If they would just sit down with me. These people need an end to the fighting now. To delay a week, even a few days, could cost thousands of lives. Contact the leaders. If they'll meet me in Darthen, I will join them there tomorrow. [Troi's office] Thank you, Commander. (Riker walks away, and Troi sashays into the room. Long tight low-cut dress and streaked hair up.) Deanna, could I talk to you in private. Please, you must return to your quarters. Of course, Commander. [Corridor] Deanna, I'm leaving for the surface. (She turns to us, showing her grey hair and lined face) I know, but that's not possible now. And I still do. You've done so much for me. She's been on Seronia for weeks. She knows the people, the situation. Deanna, you are my anchor. I need you more than you can possibly realise. Do you understand that? I need you here, making it possible for me to do my work. I'm not surprised. And that is by far the best news. Thank you, Captain. Deanna, I've already told you I can't Captain, perhaps we should delay transporting to the surface. Very well. No, she wasn't my mother. Captain, did you perform an autopsy against my wishes? I'll be right there. They've been arguing for hours in there. It seems hopeless. But now, when expectations are lowest, now is the moment I can be most effective. If I'm focused, centred, free of disquieting thoughts, I can turn these factions toward peace. Hear me out, Captain. It's important you understand. You see, I discovered long ago I had the ability to channel my darker thoughts, my unwanted emotions, to others, leaving me unencumbered. I hadn't planned it. I'd expected Maylor to live through the negotiation. Her death could not have been more untimely. She's an empath. I was reasonably certain I could establish a link with her. Frankly, I was amazed when I saw how quickly she'd aged. Usually my receptacles survive for years. Come now, Captain. Surely you can see there's a broader canvas here. If I came to these peace talks hindered by unwanted emotions, the Rekags and Seronians would be condemned to go on fighting Captain. do you know how many people have died on this planet in the last forty eight hours? Thousands. Deanna Troi is just one individual. Ask the Seronian and Rekag children who go to bed each night in fear of their lives. Captain, I get no payment, I have no power base, no agenda. I am willing to risk my life simply to help others. I have no intention of releasing her now or ever. If you'll excuse me, Captain. I'm needed. Well, my friend, an era of conflict and bloodshed appears to be over. (Alkar staggers) I'm fine. Just a little light-headed. No of course not. I'm here, Captain. [Bridge] We're ready, Captain. [Sickbay] (Alkar, Liva and Worf enter) Will you wait for me in my quarters? It's a tragic loss, but her death had a purpose. Your own Federation Council has granted me safe and timely passage back to my planet. I expect you to honour that, Captain. (Alkar leaves) She helped me so much. Without her, I couldn't have accomplished what I did. Yes, there is something. If we could share the funeral meditation. [Sickbay] Rohm gah sevi rohm. Rohm gah. An end (twitch) An end to pain.
