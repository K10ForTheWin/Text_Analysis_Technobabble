Hey! Yes? I'm sorry did we meet last night at George's party? Are you okay? We met here before? I'm afraid I don't accept drinks from strange men on the beach. (He leaves the drinks and follows her along the beach.) So tell me the truth. Have we really meet before? Then how did you know my name? Are you going to tell me your name? Ah, a junior officer. My mother warned me to watch out for junior officers. You're awfully sure of yourself. Do you use this routine a lot with women? Sure. I don't know. I'll probably be sorry. (The orb appears) It is corporeal. A physical entity. Linear time. what is this? Does not exist yet? Jennifer. She is part of your existence. But she is part of your existence. Lost? what is this? It is inconceivable that any species could exist in such a manner. You are deceiving us. Pleasure? What is this? Then why do you exist here? You exist here. [Limbo] More of your kind. Wormhole? What is this? The child with Jennifer. Linear procreation? The sound of children playing. [Baseball field] You bring us here. The termination of their linear existence. (and she puts her hand on his cheek) You exist here. None of your past experiences helped prepare you for this consequence. So you choose to exist here. It is not linear. Mister Garak said you wanted to see me. If you're wondering when the new sensor array will be finished, the answer is Will that be all? I have to get back to work. Nothing you could tell me about Ben would interest me. I haven't even seen him in five years. Can I go now? Were other Terrans killed with him? All this killing, it has to stop. Hello, Ben. Please leave us. All right, I'm here. What did you want to see me about? Really? You never seemed interested in talking to me while we were married. Save the apologies, Ben. They're not going to work. You are without a doubt, the most insensitive, self-absorbed, egotistical I doubt it. You never listened to me before. You were always too busy trying to impress every woman who crossed your path. There were enough. And if it wasn't women, then it was that ship of yours. Sometimes I think it was the only thing you ever loved. Then why did you leave me to go run and play pirate for the Intendant? And now this Rebellion of yours. Do you know how many deaths you've caused? How much destruction? You're fighting because you like to fight, Benjamin. The only thing you've accomplished is to give the Alliance an excuse to treat the Terrans worse than before. I just hope that with your capture, this rebellion can be ended peacefully. Oh, I suppose you came here just to see me? Rescue me? I'm not going anywhere with you. I have a job to finish. That's right. All I want to do is to put an end to all this fighting. To force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement with the Alliance. The rebellion is killing people every day. It has to stop. You have no right to talk to me like that. Since when do you care about what happens to our people? You've never cared about anyone but yourself. How many times have I heard you say that? You guess? You're right about that. For a second, I almost believed you. You know what I wish? I wish I'd never met you. I don't know what you're talking about. The Alliance is your enemy, not mine. What if I am a prisoner? You want me to join the rebellion? What are you doing? You have a subdermal communicator? Do I have a choice? All right. But lets get one thing clear. I still hate you. You still haven't told me where we're going. Now what? Something tells me that's not part of your plan. What if we offer a trade? I stay here and she lets you live. Nothing. I believe you. (Sisko starts working a console.) Actually, for the first time since I've met him, he's not annoying me. In fact, he's been making a lot of sense. I'm a Terran. Dax tells me you're leaving. Then I guess this is goodbye. Why don't you start by telling me what happened to my husband? He's dead, isn't he? Don't be. Who are you, really? He seems like a good man. Oh, I'm sure Smiley'll find something to keep me busy. You're not really going to visit the Romulans, are you. Will I see you again? Thank you for rescuing me. You'd better go. I'm afraid I'm not your mother, Jake. That's right. And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? Well, here I am. I came here to see your father. We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. I see your father has told you all about us. I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. We'll wait. Thank you. That would be nice. What? Jake, isn't she a little old for you? Does it matter? It was mine. We needed you to help us complete the ship. Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son. I knew that Jake would want to meet me, that I'd remind him of his mother. I think Jake would disagree. Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to fight the good fight for my people. I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. I can't. Because he won't leave me alone. [Klingon Bridge] (This ship is big, really big. It dwarfs it's Cardassian Galor-class escorts. Garak is lead in by a chain attached to a collar around his neck.) It was delicious. What do you call it? How did you learn to cook like this? Maybe one day I will. (Doorbell) Come in. How about some chicken a la Sisko? Jake made dinner. It's delicious. Oh, that's really not necessary. How's the work on the Defiant coming? Does that feel better? I don't expect to gain anything. I just want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I don't know why you're being so hard on me. After all, you pretended to be my husband and I've forgiven you. By the way, you have done a good job with him. Jake, I mean. Oh, he'll get over me. I wish I could say the same. Is it really a surprise? Think about it. My Ben Sisko is dead. I look at Jake and all I see is the son that I'll never have. Maybe bringing him here wasn't such a good idea after all. Come in? You look like you could use another pair of hands. Here, let me. Yes, I know. To control the inertial dampers. It's Professor Sisko, remember? For what it's worth, you should know that I've told Jake the truth. About my visit to you, why I brought him here, everything. And he said that it doesn't matter. That he's still glad to have met me. Funny thing is, I know he means it. It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. No one has ever cared about me like that before. So, if it's all right with you, I will see to it that he is sent back to Deep Space Nine. Right away. He trusts you to finish your job. And so do I. Would you like to say goodbye to him? Ben? When we first met there was a connection between us. And now, because of what I've done, it's gone, isn't it? I'd better go get Jake home. [Terok Nor Promenade - upper level] (Yup, it's at that location again.) Jake, I need to speak with you. In private. Believe me, Jake, It's better in the long run if I don't. For all of us. (And they walk round the corner to see the Intendant and her weapon.) You want me to go with you, fine. But leave the boy here. That doesn't matter. You're not taking him. No! (Jennifer is shot instead.) Ben. I knew we were still connected.

My mother warned me to watch out for junior officers. You're awfully sure of yourself. Do you use this routine a lot with women? Sure. I don't know. I'll probably be sorry. (The orb appears) It is corporeal. A physical entity. Linear time. what is this? Does not exist yet? Jennifer. She is part of your existence. But she is part of your existence. Lost? what is this? It is inconceivable that any species could exist in such a manner. You are deceiving us. Pleasure? What is this? Then why do you exist here? You exist here. [Limbo] More of your kind. Wormhole? What is this? The child with Jennifer. Linear procreation? The sound of children playing. [Baseball field] You bring us here. The termination of their linear existence. (and she puts her hand on his cheek) You exist here. None of your past experiences helped prepare you for this consequence. So you choose to exist here. It is not linear. Mister Garak said you wanted to see me. If you're wondering when the new sensor array will be finished, the answer is Will that be all? I have to get back to work. Nothing you could tell me about Ben would interest me. I haven't even seen him in five years. Can I go now? Were other Terrans killed with him? All this killing, it has to stop. Hello, Ben. Please leave us. All right, I'm here. What did you want to see me about? Really? You never seemed interested in talking to me while we were married. Save the apologies, Ben. They're not going to work. You are without a doubt, the most insensitive, self-absorbed, egotistical I doubt it. You never listened to me before. You were always too busy trying to impress every woman who crossed your path. There were enough. And if it wasn't women, then it was that ship of yours. Sometimes I think it was the only thing you ever loved. Then why did you leave me to go run and play pirate for the Intendant? And now this Rebellion of yours. Do you know how many deaths you've caused? How much destruction? You're fighting because you like to fight, Benjamin. The only thing you've accomplished is to give the Alliance an excuse to treat the Terrans worse than before. I just hope that with your capture, this rebellion can be ended peacefully. Oh, I suppose you came here just to see me? Rescue me? I'm not going anywhere with you. I have a job to finish. That's right. All I want to do is to put an end to all this fighting. To force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement with the Alliance. The rebellion is killing people every day. It has to stop. You have no right to talk to me like that. Since when do you care about what happens to our people? You've never cared about anyone but yourself. How many times have I heard you say that? You guess? You're right about that. For a second, I almost believed you. You know what I wish? I wish I'd never met you. I don't know what you're talking about. The Alliance is your enemy, not mine. What if I am a prisoner? You want me to join the rebellion? What are you doing? You have a subdermal communicator? Do I have a choice? All right. But lets get one thing clear. I still hate you. You still haven't told me where we're going. Now what? Something tells me that's not part of your plan. What if we offer a trade? I stay here and she lets you live. Nothing. I believe you. (Sisko starts working a console.) Actually, for the first time since I've met him, he's not annoying me. In fact, he's been making a lot of sense. I'm a Terran. Dax tells me you're leaving. Then I guess this is goodbye. Why don't you start by telling me what happened to my husband? He's dead, isn't he? Don't be. Who are you, really? He seems like a good man. Oh, I'm sure Smiley'll find something to keep me busy. You're not really going to visit the Romulans, are you. Will I see you again? Thank you for rescuing me. You'd better go. I'm afraid I'm not your mother, Jake. That's right. And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? Well, here I am. I came here to see your father. We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. I see your father has told you all about us. I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. We'll wait. Thank you. That would be nice. What? Jake, isn't she a little old for you? Does it matter? It was mine. We needed you to help us complete the ship. Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son. I knew that Jake would want to meet me, that I'd remind him of his mother. I think Jake would disagree. Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to fight the good fight for my people. I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. I can't. Because he won't leave me alone. [Klingon Bridge] (This ship is big, really big. It dwarfs it's Cardassian Galor-class escorts. Garak is lead in by a chain attached to a collar around his neck.) It was delicious. What do you call it? How did you learn to cook like this? Maybe one day I will. (Doorbell) Come in. How about some chicken a la Sisko? Jake made dinner. It's delicious. Oh, that's really not necessary. How's the work on the Defiant coming? Does that feel better? I don't expect to gain anything. I just want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I don't know why you're being so hard on me. After all, you pretended to be my husband and I've forgiven you. By the way, you have done a good job with him. Jake, I mean. Oh, he'll get over me. I wish I could say the same. Is it really a surprise? Think about it. My Ben Sisko is dead. I look at Jake and all I see is the son that I'll never have. Maybe bringing him here wasn't such a good idea after all. Come in? You look like you could use another pair of hands. Here, let me. Yes, I know. To control the inertial dampers. It's Professor Sisko, remember? For what it's worth, you should know that I've told Jake the truth. About my visit to you, why I brought him here, everything. And he said that it doesn't matter. That he's still glad to have met me. Funny thing is, I know he means it. It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. No one has ever cared about me like that before. So, if it's all right with you, I will see to it that he is sent back to Deep Space Nine. Right away. He trusts you to finish your job. And so do I. Would you like to say goodbye to him? Ben? When we first met there was a connection between us. And now, because of what I've done, it's gone, isn't it? I'd better go get Jake home. [Terok Nor Promenade - upper level] (Yup, it's at that location again.) Jake, I need to speak with you. In private. Believe me, Jake, It's better in the long run if I don't. For all of us. (And they walk round the corner to see the Intendant and her weapon.) You want me to go with you, fine. But leave the boy here. That doesn't matter. You're not taking him. No! (Jennifer is shot instead.) Ben. I knew we were still connected.

My mother warned me to watch out for junior officers. You're awfully sure of yourself. Do you use this routine a lot with women? Sure. I don't know. I'll probably be sorry. (The orb appears) It is corporeal. A physical entity. Linear time. what is this? Does not exist yet? Jennifer. She is part of your existence. But she is part of your existence. Lost? what is this? It is inconceivable that any species could exist in such a manner. You are deceiving us. Pleasure? What is this? Then why do you exist here? You exist here. [Limbo] More of your kind. Wormhole? What is this? The child with Jennifer. Linear procreation? The sound of children playing. [Baseball field] You bring us here. The termination of their linear existence. (and she puts her hand on his cheek) You exist here. None of your past experiences helped prepare you for this consequence. So you choose to exist here. It is not linear. Mister Garak said you wanted to see me. If you're wondering when the new sensor array will be finished, the answer is Will that be all? I have to get back to work. Nothing you could tell me about Ben would interest me. I haven't even seen him in five years. Can I go now? Were other Terrans killed with him? All this killing, it has to stop. Hello, Ben. Please leave us. All right, I'm here. What did you want to see me about? Really? You never seemed interested in talking to me while we were married. Save the apologies, Ben. They're not going to work. You are without a doubt, the most insensitive, self-absorbed, egotistical I doubt it. You never listened to me before. You were always too busy trying to impress every woman who crossed your path. There were enough. And if it wasn't women, then it was that ship of yours. Sometimes I think it was the only thing you ever loved. Then why did you leave me to go run and play pirate for the Intendant? And now this Rebellion of yours. Do you know how many deaths you've caused? How much destruction? You're fighting because you like to fight, Benjamin. The only thing you've accomplished is to give the Alliance an excuse to treat the Terrans worse than before. I just hope that with your capture, this rebellion can be ended peacefully. Oh, I suppose you came here just to see me? Rescue me? I'm not going anywhere with you. I have a job to finish. That's right. All I want to do is to put an end to all this fighting. To force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement with the Alliance. The rebellion is killing people every day. It has to stop. You have no right to talk to me like that. Since when do you care about what happens to our people? You've never cared about anyone but yourself. How many times have I heard you say that? You guess? You're right about that. For a second, I almost believed you. You know what I wish? I wish I'd never met you. I don't know what you're talking about. The Alliance is your enemy, not mine. What if I am a prisoner? You want me to join the rebellion? What are you doing? You have a subdermal communicator? Do I have a choice? All right. But lets get one thing clear. I still hate you. You still haven't told me where we're going. Now what? Something tells me that's not part of your plan. What if we offer a trade? I stay here and she lets you live. Nothing. I believe you. (Sisko starts working a console.) Actually, for the first time since I've met him, he's not annoying me. In fact, he's been making a lot of sense. I'm a Terran. Dax tells me you're leaving. Then I guess this is goodbye. Why don't you start by telling me what happened to my husband? He's dead, isn't he? Don't be. Who are you, really? He seems like a good man. Oh, I'm sure Smiley'll find something to keep me busy. You're not really going to visit the Romulans, are you. Will I see you again? Thank you for rescuing me. You'd better go. I'm afraid I'm not your mother, Jake. That's right. And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? Well, here I am. I came here to see your father. We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. I see your father has told you all about us. I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. We'll wait. Thank you. That would be nice. What? Jake, isn't she a little old for you? Does it matter? It was mine. We needed you to help us complete the ship. Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son. I knew that Jake would want to meet me, that I'd remind him of his mother. I think Jake would disagree. Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to fight the good fight for my people. I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. I can't. Because he won't leave me alone. [Klingon Bridge] (This ship is big, really big. It dwarfs it's Cardassian Galor-class escorts. Garak is lead in by a chain attached to a collar around his neck.) It was delicious. What do you call it? How did you learn to cook like this? Maybe one day I will. (Doorbell) Come in. How about some chicken a la Sisko? Jake made dinner. It's delicious. Oh, that's really not necessary. How's the work on the Defiant coming? Does that feel better? I don't expect to gain anything. I just want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I don't know why you're being so hard on me. After all, you pretended to be my husband and I've forgiven you. By the way, you have done a good job with him. Jake, I mean. Oh, he'll get over me. I wish I could say the same. Is it really a surprise? Think about it. My Ben Sisko is dead. I look at Jake and all I see is the son that I'll never have. Maybe bringing him here wasn't such a good idea after all. Come in? You look like you could use another pair of hands. Here, let me. Yes, I know. To control the inertial dampers. It's Professor Sisko, remember? For what it's worth, you should know that I've told Jake the truth. About my visit to you, why I brought him here, everything. And he said that it doesn't matter. That he's still glad to have met me. Funny thing is, I know he means it. It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. No one has ever cared about me like that before. So, if it's all right with you, I will see to it that he is sent back to Deep Space Nine. Right away. He trusts you to finish your job. And so do I. Would you like to say goodbye to him? Ben? When we first met there was a connection between us. And now, because of what I've done, it's gone, isn't it? I'd better go get Jake home. [Terok Nor Promenade - upper level] (Yup, it's at that location again.) Jake, I need to speak with you. In private. Believe me, Jake, It's better in the long run if I don't. For all of us. (And they walk round the corner to see the Intendant and her weapon.) You want me to go with you, fine. But leave the boy here. That doesn't matter. You're not taking him. No! (Jennifer is shot instead.) Ben. I knew we were still connected.

My mother warned me to watch out for junior officers. You're awfully sure of yourself. Do you use this routine a lot with women? Sure. I don't know. I'll probably be sorry. (The orb appears) It is corporeal. A physical entity. Linear time. what is this? Does not exist yet? Jennifer. She is part of your existence. But she is part of your existence. Lost? what is this? It is inconceivable that any species could exist in such a manner. You are deceiving us. Pleasure? What is this? Then why do you exist here? You exist here. [Limbo] More of your kind. Wormhole? What is this? The child with Jennifer. Linear procreation? The sound of children playing. [Baseball field] You bring us here. The termination of their linear existence. (and she puts her hand on his cheek) You exist here. None of your past experiences helped prepare you for this consequence. So you choose to exist here. It is not linear. Mister Garak said you wanted to see me. If you're wondering when the new sensor array will be finished, the answer is Will that be all? I have to get back to work. Nothing you could tell me about Ben would interest me. I haven't even seen him in five years. Can I go now? Were other Terrans killed with him? All this killing, it has to stop. Hello, Ben. Please leave us. All right, I'm here. What did you want to see me about? Really? You never seemed interested in talking to me while we were married. Save the apologies, Ben. They're not going to work. You are without a doubt, the most insensitive, self-absorbed, egotistical I doubt it. You never listened to me before. You were always too busy trying to impress every woman who crossed your path. There were enough. And if it wasn't women, then it was that ship of yours. Sometimes I think it was the only thing you ever loved. Then why did you leave me to go run and play pirate for the Intendant? And now this Rebellion of yours. Do you know how many deaths you've caused? How much destruction? You're fighting because you like to fight, Benjamin. The only thing you've accomplished is to give the Alliance an excuse to treat the Terrans worse than before. I just hope that with your capture, this rebellion can be ended peacefully. Oh, I suppose you came here just to see me? Rescue me? I'm not going anywhere with you. I have a job to finish. That's right. All I want to do is to put an end to all this fighting. To force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement with the Alliance. The rebellion is killing people every day. It has to stop. You have no right to talk to me like that. Since when do you care about what happens to our people? You've never cared about anyone but yourself. How many times have I heard you say that? You guess? You're right about that. For a second, I almost believed you. You know what I wish? I wish I'd never met you. I don't know what you're talking about. The Alliance is your enemy, not mine. What if I am a prisoner? You want me to join the rebellion? What are you doing? You have a subdermal communicator? Do I have a choice? All right. But lets get one thing clear. I still hate you. You still haven't told me where we're going. Now what? Something tells me that's not part of your plan. What if we offer a trade? I stay here and she lets you live. Nothing. I believe you. (Sisko starts working a console.) Actually, for the first time since I've met him, he's not annoying me. In fact, he's been making a lot of sense. I'm a Terran. Dax tells me you're leaving. Then I guess this is goodbye. Why don't you start by telling me what happened to my husband? He's dead, isn't he? Don't be. Who are you, really? He seems like a good man. Oh, I'm sure Smiley'll find something to keep me busy. You're not really going to visit the Romulans, are you. Will I see you again? Thank you for rescuing me. You'd better go. I'm afraid I'm not your mother, Jake. That's right. And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? Well, here I am. I came here to see your father. We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. I see your father has told you all about us. I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. We'll wait. Thank you. That would be nice. What? Jake, isn't she a little old for you? Does it matter? It was mine. We needed you to help us complete the ship. Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son. I knew that Jake would want to meet me, that I'd remind him of his mother. I think Jake would disagree. Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to fight the good fight for my people. I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. I can't. Because he won't leave me alone. [Klingon Bridge] (This ship is big, really big. It dwarfs it's Cardassian Galor-class escorts. Garak is lead in by a chain attached to a collar around his neck.) It was delicious. What do you call it? How did you learn to cook like this? Maybe one day I will. (Doorbell) Come in. How about some chicken a la Sisko? Jake made dinner. It's delicious. Oh, that's really not necessary. How's the work on the Defiant coming? Does that feel better? I don't expect to gain anything. I just want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I don't know why you're being so hard on me. After all, you pretended to be my husband and I've forgiven you. By the way, you have done a good job with him. Jake, I mean. Oh, he'll get over me. I wish I could say the same. Is it really a surprise? Think about it. My Ben Sisko is dead. I look at Jake and all I see is the son that I'll never have. Maybe bringing him here wasn't such a good idea after all. Come in? You look like you could use another pair of hands. Here, let me. Yes, I know. To control the inertial dampers. It's Professor Sisko, remember? For what it's worth, you should know that I've told Jake the truth. About my visit to you, why I brought him here, everything. And he said that it doesn't matter. That he's still glad to have met me. Funny thing is, I know he means it. It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. No one has ever cared about me like that before. So, if it's all right with you, I will see to it that he is sent back to Deep Space Nine. Right away. He trusts you to finish your job. And so do I. Would you like to say goodbye to him? Ben? When we first met there was a connection between us. And now, because of what I've done, it's gone, isn't it? I'd better go get Jake home. [Terok Nor Promenade - upper level] (Yup, it's at that location again.) Jake, I need to speak with you. In private. Believe me, Jake, It's better in the long run if I don't. For all of us. (And they walk round the corner to see the Intendant and her weapon.) You want me to go with you, fine. But leave the boy here. That doesn't matter. You're not taking him. No! (Jennifer is shot instead.) Ben. I knew we were still connected.

My mother warned me to watch out for junior officers. You're awfully sure of yourself. Do you use this routine a lot with women? Sure. I don't know. I'll probably be sorry. (The orb appears) It is corporeal. A physical entity. Linear time. what is this? Does not exist yet? Jennifer. She is part of your existence. But she is part of your existence. Lost? what is this? It is inconceivable that any species could exist in such a manner. You are deceiving us. Pleasure? What is this? Then why do you exist here? You exist here. [Limbo] More of your kind. Wormhole? What is this? The child with Jennifer. Linear procreation? The sound of children playing. [Baseball field] You bring us here. The termination of their linear existence. (and she puts her hand on his cheek) You exist here. None of your past experiences helped prepare you for this consequence. So you choose to exist here. It is not linear. Mister Garak said you wanted to see me. If you're wondering when the new sensor array will be finished, the answer is Will that be all? I have to get back to work. Nothing you could tell me about Ben would interest me. I haven't even seen him in five years. Can I go now? Were other Terrans killed with him? All this killing, it has to stop. Hello, Ben. Please leave us. All right, I'm here. What did you want to see me about? Really? You never seemed interested in talking to me while we were married. Save the apologies, Ben. They're not going to work. You are without a doubt, the most insensitive, self-absorbed, egotistical I doubt it. You never listened to me before. You were always too busy trying to impress every woman who crossed your path. There were enough. And if it wasn't women, then it was that ship of yours. Sometimes I think it was the only thing you ever loved. Then why did you leave me to go run and play pirate for the Intendant? And now this Rebellion of yours. Do you know how many deaths you've caused? How much destruction? You're fighting because you like to fight, Benjamin. The only thing you've accomplished is to give the Alliance an excuse to treat the Terrans worse than before. I just hope that with your capture, this rebellion can be ended peacefully. Oh, I suppose you came here just to see me? Rescue me? I'm not going anywhere with you. I have a job to finish. That's right. All I want to do is to put an end to all this fighting. To force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement with the Alliance. The rebellion is killing people every day. It has to stop. You have no right to talk to me like that. Since when do you care about what happens to our people? You've never cared about anyone but yourself. How many times have I heard you say that? You guess? You're right about that. For a second, I almost believed you. You know what I wish? I wish I'd never met you. I don't know what you're talking about. The Alliance is your enemy, not mine. What if I am a prisoner? You want me to join the rebellion? What are you doing? You have a subdermal communicator? Do I have a choice? All right. But lets get one thing clear. I still hate you. You still haven't told me where we're going. Now what? Something tells me that's not part of your plan. What if we offer a trade? I stay here and she lets you live. Nothing. I believe you. (Sisko starts working a console.) Actually, for the first time since I've met him, he's not annoying me. In fact, he's been making a lot of sense. I'm a Terran. Dax tells me you're leaving. Then I guess this is goodbye. Why don't you start by telling me what happened to my husband? He's dead, isn't he? Don't be. Who are you, really? He seems like a good man. Oh, I'm sure Smiley'll find something to keep me busy. You're not really going to visit the Romulans, are you. Will I see you again? Thank you for rescuing me. You'd better go. I'm afraid I'm not your mother, Jake. That's right. And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? Well, here I am. I came here to see your father. We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. I see your father has told you all about us. I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. We'll wait. Thank you. That would be nice. What? Jake, isn't she a little old for you? Does it matter? It was mine. We needed you to help us complete the ship. Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son. I knew that Jake would want to meet me, that I'd remind him of his mother. I think Jake would disagree. Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to fight the good fight for my people. I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. I can't. Because he won't leave me alone. [Klingon Bridge] (This ship is big, really big. It dwarfs it's Cardassian Galor-class escorts. Garak is lead in by a chain attached to a collar around his neck.) It was delicious. What do you call it? How did you learn to cook like this? Maybe one day I will. (Doorbell) Come in. How about some chicken a la Sisko? Jake made dinner. It's delicious. Oh, that's really not necessary. How's the work on the Defiant coming? Does that feel better? I don't expect to gain anything. I just want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I don't know why you're being so hard on me. After all, you pretended to be my husband and I've forgiven you. By the way, you have done a good job with him. Jake, I mean. Oh, he'll get over me. I wish I could say the same. Is it really a surprise? Think about it. My Ben Sisko is dead. I look at Jake and all I see is the son that I'll never have. Maybe bringing him here wasn't such a good idea after all. Come in? You look like you could use another pair of hands. Here, let me. Yes, I know. To control the inertial dampers. It's Professor Sisko, remember? For what it's worth, you should know that I've told Jake the truth. About my visit to you, why I brought him here, everything. And he said that it doesn't matter. That he's still glad to have met me. Funny thing is, I know he means it. It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. No one has ever cared about me like that before. So, if it's all right with you, I will see to it that he is sent back to Deep Space Nine. Right away. He trusts you to finish your job. And so do I. Would you like to say goodbye to him? Ben? When we first met there was a connection between us. And now, because of what I've done, it's gone, isn't it? I'd better go get Jake home. [Terok Nor Promenade - upper level] (Yup, it's at that location again.) Jake, I need to speak with you. In private. Believe me, Jake, It's better in the long run if I don't. For all of us. (And they walk round the corner to see the Intendant and her weapon.) You want me to go with you, fine. But leave the boy here. That doesn't matter. You're not taking him. No! (Jennifer is shot instead.) Ben. I knew we were still connected.

My mother warned me to watch out for junior officers. You're awfully sure of yourself. Do you use this routine a lot with women? Sure. I don't know. I'll probably be sorry. (The orb appears) It is corporeal. A physical entity. Linear time. what is this? Does not exist yet? Jennifer. She is part of your existence. But she is part of your existence. Lost? what is this? It is inconceivable that any species could exist in such a manner. You are deceiving us. Pleasure? What is this? Then why do you exist here? You exist here. [Limbo] More of your kind. Wormhole? What is this? The child with Jennifer. Linear procreation? The sound of children playing. [Baseball field] You bring us here. The termination of their linear existence. (and she puts her hand on his cheek) You exist here. None of your past experiences helped prepare you for this consequence. So you choose to exist here. It is not linear. Mister Garak said you wanted to see me. If you're wondering when the new sensor array will be finished, the answer is Will that be all? I have to get back to work. Nothing you could tell me about Ben would interest me. I haven't even seen him in five years. Can I go now? Were other Terrans killed with him? All this killing, it has to stop. Hello, Ben. Please leave us. All right, I'm here. What did you want to see me about? Really? You never seemed interested in talking to me while we were married. Save the apologies, Ben. They're not going to work. You are without a doubt, the most insensitive, self-absorbed, egotistical I doubt it. You never listened to me before. You were always too busy trying to impress every woman who crossed your path. There were enough. And if it wasn't women, then it was that ship of yours. Sometimes I think it was the only thing you ever loved. Then why did you leave me to go run and play pirate for the Intendant? And now this Rebellion of yours. Do you know how many deaths you've caused? How much destruction? You're fighting because you like to fight, Benjamin. The only thing you've accomplished is to give the Alliance an excuse to treat the Terrans worse than before. I just hope that with your capture, this rebellion can be ended peacefully. Oh, I suppose you came here just to see me? Rescue me? I'm not going anywhere with you. I have a job to finish. That's right. All I want to do is to put an end to all this fighting. To force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement with the Alliance. The rebellion is killing people every day. It has to stop. You have no right to talk to me like that. Since when do you care about what happens to our people? You've never cared about anyone but yourself. How many times have I heard you say that? You guess? You're right about that. For a second, I almost believed you. You know what I wish? I wish I'd never met you. I don't know what you're talking about. The Alliance is your enemy, not mine. What if I am a prisoner? You want me to join the rebellion? What are you doing? You have a subdermal communicator? Do I have a choice? All right. But lets get one thing clear. I still hate you. You still haven't told me where we're going. Now what? Something tells me that's not part of your plan. What if we offer a trade? I stay here and she lets you live. Nothing. I believe you. (Sisko starts working a console.) Actually, for the first time since I've met him, he's not annoying me. In fact, he's been making a lot of sense. I'm a Terran. Dax tells me you're leaving. Then I guess this is goodbye. Why don't you start by telling me what happened to my husband? He's dead, isn't he? Don't be. Who are you, really? He seems like a good man. Oh, I'm sure Smiley'll find something to keep me busy. You're not really going to visit the Romulans, are you. Will I see you again? Thank you for rescuing me. You'd better go. I'm afraid I'm not your mother, Jake. That's right. And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? Well, here I am. I came here to see your father. We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. I see your father has told you all about us. I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. We'll wait. Thank you. That would be nice. What? Jake, isn't she a little old for you? Does it matter? It was mine. We needed you to help us complete the ship. Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son. I knew that Jake would want to meet me, that I'd remind him of his mother. I think Jake would disagree. Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to fight the good fight for my people. I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. I can't. Because he won't leave me alone. [Klingon Bridge] (This ship is big, really big. It dwarfs it's Cardassian Galor-class escorts. Garak is lead in by a chain attached to a collar around his neck.) It was delicious. What do you call it? How did you learn to cook like this? Maybe one day I will. (Doorbell) Come in. How about some chicken a la Sisko? Jake made dinner. It's delicious. Oh, that's really not necessary. How's the work on the Defiant coming? Does that feel better? I don't expect to gain anything. I just want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I don't know why you're being so hard on me. After all, you pretended to be my husband and I've forgiven you. By the way, you have done a good job with him. Jake, I mean. Oh, he'll get over me. I wish I could say the same. Is it really a surprise? Think about it. My Ben Sisko is dead. I look at Jake and all I see is the son that I'll never have. Maybe bringing him here wasn't such a good idea after all. Come in? You look like you could use another pair of hands. Here, let me. Yes, I know. To control the inertial dampers. It's Professor Sisko, remember? For what it's worth, you should know that I've told Jake the truth. About my visit to you, why I brought him here, everything. And he said that it doesn't matter. That he's still glad to have met me. Funny thing is, I know he means it. It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. No one has ever cared about me like that before. So, if it's all right with you, I will see to it that he is sent back to Deep Space Nine. Right away. He trusts you to finish your job. And so do I. Would you like to say goodbye to him? Ben? When we first met there was a connection between us. And now, because of what I've done, it's gone, isn't it? I'd better go get Jake home. [Terok Nor Promenade - upper level] (Yup, it's at that location again.) Jake, I need to speak with you. In private. Believe me, Jake, It's better in the long run if I don't. For all of us. (And they walk round the corner to see the Intendant and her weapon.) You want me to go with you, fine. But leave the boy here. That doesn't matter. You're not taking him. No! (Jennifer is shot instead.) Ben. I knew we were still connected.

My mother warned me to watch out for junior officers. You're awfully sure of yourself. Do you use this routine a lot with women? Sure. I don't know. I'll probably be sorry. (The orb appears) It is corporeal. A physical entity. Linear time. what is this? Does not exist yet? Jennifer. She is part of your existence. But she is part of your existence. Lost? what is this? It is inconceivable that any species could exist in such a manner. You are deceiving us. Pleasure? What is this? Then why do you exist here? You exist here. [Limbo] More of your kind. Wormhole? What is this? The child with Jennifer. Linear procreation? The sound of children playing. [Baseball field] You bring us here. The termination of their linear existence. (and she puts her hand on his cheek) You exist here. None of your past experiences helped prepare you for this consequence. So you choose to exist here. It is not linear. Mister Garak said you wanted to see me. If you're wondering when the new sensor array will be finished, the answer is Will that be all? I have to get back to work. Nothing you could tell me about Ben would interest me. I haven't even seen him in five years. Can I go now? Were other Terrans killed with him? All this killing, it has to stop. Hello, Ben. Please leave us. All right, I'm here. What did you want to see me about? Really? You never seemed interested in talking to me while we were married. Save the apologies, Ben. They're not going to work. You are without a doubt, the most insensitive, self-absorbed, egotistical I doubt it. You never listened to me before. You were always too busy trying to impress every woman who crossed your path. There were enough. And if it wasn't women, then it was that ship of yours. Sometimes I think it was the only thing you ever loved. Then why did you leave me to go run and play pirate for the Intendant? And now this Rebellion of yours. Do you know how many deaths you've caused? How much destruction? You're fighting because you like to fight, Benjamin. The only thing you've accomplished is to give the Alliance an excuse to treat the Terrans worse than before. I just hope that with your capture, this rebellion can be ended peacefully. Oh, I suppose you came here just to see me? Rescue me? I'm not going anywhere with you. I have a job to finish. That's right. All I want to do is to put an end to all this fighting. To force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement with the Alliance. The rebellion is killing people every day. It has to stop. You have no right to talk to me like that. Since when do you care about what happens to our people? You've never cared about anyone but yourself. How many times have I heard you say that? You guess? You're right about that. For a second, I almost believed you. You know what I wish? I wish I'd never met you. I don't know what you're talking about. The Alliance is your enemy, not mine. What if I am a prisoner? You want me to join the rebellion? What are you doing? You have a subdermal communicator? Do I have a choice? All right. But lets get one thing clear. I still hate you. You still haven't told me where we're going. Now what? Something tells me that's not part of your plan. What if we offer a trade? I stay here and she lets you live. Nothing. I believe you. (Sisko starts working a console.) Actually, for the first time since I've met him, he's not annoying me. In fact, he's been making a lot of sense. I'm a Terran. Dax tells me you're leaving. Then I guess this is goodbye. Why don't you start by telling me what happened to my husband? He's dead, isn't he? Don't be. Who are you, really? He seems like a good man. Oh, I'm sure Smiley'll find something to keep me busy. You're not really going to visit the Romulans, are you. Will I see you again? Thank you for rescuing me. You'd better go. I'm afraid I'm not your mother, Jake. That's right. And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? Well, here I am. I came here to see your father. We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. I see your father has told you all about us. I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. We'll wait. Thank you. That would be nice. What? Jake, isn't she a little old for you? Does it matter? It was mine. We needed you to help us complete the ship. Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son. I knew that Jake would want to meet me, that I'd remind him of his mother. I think Jake would disagree. Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to fight the good fight for my people. I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. I can't. Because he won't leave me alone. [Klingon Bridge] (This ship is big, really big. It dwarfs it's Cardassian Galor-class escorts. Garak is lead in by a chain attached to a collar around his neck.) It was delicious. What do you call it? How did you learn to cook like this? Maybe one day I will. (Doorbell) Come in. How about some chicken a la Sisko? Jake made dinner. It's delicious. Oh, that's really not necessary. How's the work on the Defiant coming? Does that feel better? I don't expect to gain anything. I just want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I don't know why you're being so hard on me. After all, you pretended to be my husband and I've forgiven you. By the way, you have done a good job with him. Jake, I mean. Oh, he'll get over me. I wish I could say the same. Is it really a surprise? Think about it. My Ben Sisko is dead. I look at Jake and all I see is the son that I'll never have. Maybe bringing him here wasn't such a good idea after all. Come in? You look like you could use another pair of hands. Here, let me. Yes, I know. To control the inertial dampers. It's Professor Sisko, remember? For what it's worth, you should know that I've told Jake the truth. About my visit to you, why I brought him here, everything. And he said that it doesn't matter. That he's still glad to have met me. Funny thing is, I know he means it. It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. No one has ever cared about me like that before. So, if it's all right with you, I will see to it that he is sent back to Deep Space Nine. Right away. He trusts you to finish your job. And so do I. Would you like to say goodbye to him? Ben? When we first met there was a connection between us. And now, because of what I've done, it's gone, isn't it? I'd better go get Jake home. [Terok Nor Promenade - upper level] (Yup, it's at that location again.) Jake, I need to speak with you. In private. Believe me, Jake, It's better in the long run if I don't. For all of us. (And they walk round the corner to see the Intendant and her weapon.) You want me to go with you, fine. But leave the boy here. That doesn't matter. You're not taking him. No! (Jennifer is shot instead.) Ben. I knew we were still connected.

My mother warned me to watch out for junior officers. You're awfully sure of yourself. Do you use this routine a lot with women? Sure. I don't know. I'll probably be sorry. (The orb appears) It is corporeal. A physical entity. Linear time. what is this? Does not exist yet? Jennifer. She is part of your existence. But she is part of your existence. Lost? what is this? It is inconceivable that any species could exist in such a manner. You are deceiving us. Pleasure? What is this? Then why do you exist here? You exist here. [Limbo] More of your kind. Wormhole? What is this? The child with Jennifer. Linear procreation? The sound of children playing. [Baseball field] You bring us here. The termination of their linear existence. (and she puts her hand on his cheek) You exist here. None of your past experiences helped prepare you for this consequence. So you choose to exist here. It is not linear. Mister Garak said you wanted to see me. If you're wondering when the new sensor array will be finished, the answer is Will that be all? I have to get back to work. Nothing you could tell me about Ben would interest me. I haven't even seen him in five years. Can I go now? Were other Terrans killed with him? All this killing, it has to stop. Hello, Ben. Please leave us. All right, I'm here. What did you want to see me about? Really? You never seemed interested in talking to me while we were married. Save the apologies, Ben. They're not going to work. You are without a doubt, the most insensitive, self-absorbed, egotistical I doubt it. You never listened to me before. You were always too busy trying to impress every woman who crossed your path. There were enough. And if it wasn't women, then it was that ship of yours. Sometimes I think it was the only thing you ever loved. Then why did you leave me to go run and play pirate for the Intendant? And now this Rebellion of yours. Do you know how many deaths you've caused? How much destruction? You're fighting because you like to fight, Benjamin. The only thing you've accomplished is to give the Alliance an excuse to treat the Terrans worse than before. I just hope that with your capture, this rebellion can be ended peacefully. Oh, I suppose you came here just to see me? Rescue me? I'm not going anywhere with you. I have a job to finish. That's right. All I want to do is to put an end to all this fighting. To force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement with the Alliance. The rebellion is killing people every day. It has to stop. You have no right to talk to me like that. Since when do you care about what happens to our people? You've never cared about anyone but yourself. How many times have I heard you say that? You guess? You're right about that. For a second, I almost believed you. You know what I wish? I wish I'd never met you. I don't know what you're talking about. The Alliance is your enemy, not mine. What if I am a prisoner? You want me to join the rebellion? What are you doing? You have a subdermal communicator? Do I have a choice? All right. But lets get one thing clear. I still hate you. You still haven't told me where we're going. Now what? Something tells me that's not part of your plan. What if we offer a trade? I stay here and she lets you live. Nothing. I believe you. (Sisko starts working a console.) Actually, for the first time since I've met him, he's not annoying me. In fact, he's been making a lot of sense. I'm a Terran. Dax tells me you're leaving. Then I guess this is goodbye. Why don't you start by telling me what happened to my husband? He's dead, isn't he? Don't be. Who are you, really? He seems like a good man. Oh, I'm sure Smiley'll find something to keep me busy. You're not really going to visit the Romulans, are you. Will I see you again? Thank you for rescuing me. You'd better go. I'm afraid I'm not your mother, Jake. That's right. And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? Well, here I am. I came here to see your father. We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. I see your father has told you all about us. I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. We'll wait. Thank you. That would be nice. What? Jake, isn't she a little old for you? Does it matter? It was mine. We needed you to help us complete the ship. Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son. I knew that Jake would want to meet me, that I'd remind him of his mother. I think Jake would disagree. Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to fight the good fight for my people. I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. I can't. Because he won't leave me alone. [Klingon Bridge] (This ship is big, really big. It dwarfs it's Cardassian Galor-class escorts. Garak is lead in by a chain attached to a collar around his neck.) It was delicious. What do you call it? How did you learn to cook like this? Maybe one day I will. (Doorbell) Come in. How about some chicken a la Sisko? Jake made dinner. It's delicious. Oh, that's really not necessary. How's the work on the Defiant coming? Does that feel better? I don't expect to gain anything. I just want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I don't know why you're being so hard on me. After all, you pretended to be my husband and I've forgiven you. By the way, you have done a good job with him. Jake, I mean. Oh, he'll get over me. I wish I could say the same. Is it really a surprise? Think about it. My Ben Sisko is dead. I look at Jake and all I see is the son that I'll never have. Maybe bringing him here wasn't such a good idea after all. Come in? You look like you could use another pair of hands. Here, let me. Yes, I know. To control the inertial dampers. It's Professor Sisko, remember? For what it's worth, you should know that I've told Jake the truth. About my visit to you, why I brought him here, everything. And he said that it doesn't matter. That he's still glad to have met me. Funny thing is, I know he means it. It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. No one has ever cared about me like that before. So, if it's all right with you, I will see to it that he is sent back to Deep Space Nine. Right away. He trusts you to finish your job. And so do I. Would you like to say goodbye to him? Ben? When we first met there was a connection between us. And now, because of what I've done, it's gone, isn't it? I'd better go get Jake home. [Terok Nor Promenade - upper level] (Yup, it's at that location again.) Jake, I need to speak with you. In private. Believe me, Jake, It's better in the long run if I don't. For all of us. (And they walk round the corner to see the Intendant and her weapon.) You want me to go with you, fine. But leave the boy here. That doesn't matter. You're not taking him. No! (Jennifer is shot instead.) Ben. I knew we were still connected.

My mother warned me to watch out for junior officers. You're awfully sure of yourself. Do you use this routine a lot with women? Sure. I don't know. I'll probably be sorry. (The orb appears) It is corporeal. A physical entity. Linear time. what is this? Does not exist yet? Jennifer. She is part of your existence. But she is part of your existence. Lost? what is this? It is inconceivable that any species could exist in such a manner. You are deceiving us. Pleasure? What is this? Then why do you exist here? You exist here. [Limbo] More of your kind. Wormhole? What is this? The child with Jennifer. Linear procreation? The sound of children playing. [Baseball field] You bring us here. The termination of their linear existence. (and she puts her hand on his cheek) You exist here. None of your past experiences helped prepare you for this consequence. So you choose to exist here. It is not linear. Mister Garak said you wanted to see me. If you're wondering when the new sensor array will be finished, the answer is Will that be all? I have to get back to work. Nothing you could tell me about Ben would interest me. I haven't even seen him in five years. Can I go now? Were other Terrans killed with him? All this killing, it has to stop. Hello, Ben. Please leave us. All right, I'm here. What did you want to see me about? Really? You never seemed interested in talking to me while we were married. Save the apologies, Ben. They're not going to work. You are without a doubt, the most insensitive, self-absorbed, egotistical I doubt it. You never listened to me before. You were always too busy trying to impress every woman who crossed your path. There were enough. And if it wasn't women, then it was that ship of yours. Sometimes I think it was the only thing you ever loved. Then why did you leave me to go run and play pirate for the Intendant? And now this Rebellion of yours. Do you know how many deaths you've caused? How much destruction? You're fighting because you like to fight, Benjamin. The only thing you've accomplished is to give the Alliance an excuse to treat the Terrans worse than before. I just hope that with your capture, this rebellion can be ended peacefully. Oh, I suppose you came here just to see me? Rescue me? I'm not going anywhere with you. I have a job to finish. That's right. All I want to do is to put an end to all this fighting. To force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement with the Alliance. The rebellion is killing people every day. It has to stop. You have no right to talk to me like that. Since when do you care about what happens to our people? You've never cared about anyone but yourself. How many times have I heard you say that? You guess? You're right about that. For a second, I almost believed you. You know what I wish? I wish I'd never met you. I don't know what you're talking about. The Alliance is your enemy, not mine. What if I am a prisoner? You want me to join the rebellion? What are you doing? You have a subdermal communicator? Do I have a choice? All right. But lets get one thing clear. I still hate you. You still haven't told me where we're going. Now what? Something tells me that's not part of your plan. What if we offer a trade? I stay here and she lets you live. Nothing. I believe you. (Sisko starts working a console.) Actually, for the first time since I've met him, he's not annoying me. In fact, he's been making a lot of sense. I'm a Terran. Dax tells me you're leaving. Then I guess this is goodbye. Why don't you start by telling me what happened to my husband? He's dead, isn't he? Don't be. Who are you, really? He seems like a good man. Oh, I'm sure Smiley'll find something to keep me busy. You're not really going to visit the Romulans, are you. Will I see you again? Thank you for rescuing me. You'd better go. I'm afraid I'm not your mother, Jake. That's right. And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? Well, here I am. I came here to see your father. We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. I see your father has told you all about us. I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. We'll wait. Thank you. That would be nice. What? Jake, isn't she a little old for you? Does it matter? It was mine. We needed you to help us complete the ship. Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son. I knew that Jake would want to meet me, that I'd remind him of his mother. I think Jake would disagree. Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to fight the good fight for my people. I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. I can't. Because he won't leave me alone. [Klingon Bridge] (This ship is big, really big. It dwarfs it's Cardassian Galor-class escorts. Garak is lead in by a chain attached to a collar around his neck.) It was delicious. What do you call it? How did you learn to cook like this? Maybe one day I will. (Doorbell) Come in. How about some chicken a la Sisko? Jake made dinner. It's delicious. Oh, that's really not necessary. How's the work on the Defiant coming? Does that feel better? I don't expect to gain anything. I just want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I don't know why you're being so hard on me. After all, you pretended to be my husband and I've forgiven you. By the way, you have done a good job with him. Jake, I mean. Oh, he'll get over me. I wish I could say the same. Is it really a surprise? Think about it. My Ben Sisko is dead. I look at Jake and all I see is the son that I'll never have. Maybe bringing him here wasn't such a good idea after all. Come in? You look like you could use another pair of hands. Here, let me. Yes, I know. To control the inertial dampers. It's Professor Sisko, remember? For what it's worth, you should know that I've told Jake the truth. About my visit to you, why I brought him here, everything. And he said that it doesn't matter. That he's still glad to have met me. Funny thing is, I know he means it. It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. No one has ever cared about me like that before. So, if it's all right with you, I will see to it that he is sent back to Deep Space Nine. Right away. He trusts you to finish your job. And so do I. Would you like to say goodbye to him? Ben? When we first met there was a connection between us. And now, because of what I've done, it's gone, isn't it? I'd better go get Jake home. [Terok Nor Promenade - upper level] (Yup, it's at that location again.) Jake, I need to speak with you. In private. Believe me, Jake, It's better in the long run if I don't. For all of us. (And they walk round the corner to see the Intendant and her weapon.) You want me to go with you, fine. But leave the boy here. That doesn't matter. You're not taking him. No! (Jennifer is shot instead.) Ben. I knew we were still connected.

My mother warned me to watch out for junior officers. You're awfully sure of yourself. Do you use this routine a lot with women? Sure. I don't know. I'll probably be sorry. (The orb appears) It is corporeal. A physical entity. Linear time. what is this? Does not exist yet? Jennifer. She is part of your existence. But she is part of your existence. Lost? what is this? It is inconceivable that any species could exist in such a manner. You are deceiving us. Pleasure? What is this? Then why do you exist here? You exist here. [Limbo] More of your kind. Wormhole? What is this? The child with Jennifer. Linear procreation? The sound of children playing. [Baseball field] You bring us here. The termination of their linear existence. (and she puts her hand on his cheek) You exist here. None of your past experiences helped prepare you for this consequence. So you choose to exist here. It is not linear. Mister Garak said you wanted to see me. If you're wondering when the new sensor array will be finished, the answer is Will that be all? I have to get back to work. Nothing you could tell me about Ben would interest me. I haven't even seen him in five years. Can I go now? Were other Terrans killed with him? All this killing, it has to stop. Hello, Ben. Please leave us. All right, I'm here. What did you want to see me about? Really? You never seemed interested in talking to me while we were married. Save the apologies, Ben. They're not going to work. You are without a doubt, the most insensitive, self-absorbed, egotistical I doubt it. You never listened to me before. You were always too busy trying to impress every woman who crossed your path. There were enough. And if it wasn't women, then it was that ship of yours. Sometimes I think it was the only thing you ever loved. Then why did you leave me to go run and play pirate for the Intendant? And now this Rebellion of yours. Do you know how many deaths you've caused? How much destruction? You're fighting because you like to fight, Benjamin. The only thing you've accomplished is to give the Alliance an excuse to treat the Terrans worse than before. I just hope that with your capture, this rebellion can be ended peacefully. Oh, I suppose you came here just to see me? Rescue me? I'm not going anywhere with you. I have a job to finish. That's right. All I want to do is to put an end to all this fighting. To force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement with the Alliance. The rebellion is killing people every day. It has to stop. You have no right to talk to me like that. Since when do you care about what happens to our people? You've never cared about anyone but yourself. How many times have I heard you say that? You guess? You're right about that. For a second, I almost believed you. You know what I wish? I wish I'd never met you. I don't know what you're talking about. The Alliance is your enemy, not mine. What if I am a prisoner? You want me to join the rebellion? What are you doing? You have a subdermal communicator? Do I have a choice? All right. But lets get one thing clear. I still hate you. You still haven't told me where we're going. Now what? Something tells me that's not part of your plan. What if we offer a trade? I stay here and she lets you live. Nothing. I believe you. (Sisko starts working a console.) Actually, for the first time since I've met him, he's not annoying me. In fact, he's been making a lot of sense. I'm a Terran. Dax tells me you're leaving. Then I guess this is goodbye. Why don't you start by telling me what happened to my husband? He's dead, isn't he? Don't be. Who are you, really? He seems like a good man. Oh, I'm sure Smiley'll find something to keep me busy. You're not really going to visit the Romulans, are you. Will I see you again? Thank you for rescuing me. You'd better go. I'm afraid I'm not your mother, Jake. That's right. And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? Well, here I am. I came here to see your father. We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. I see your father has told you all about us. I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. We'll wait. Thank you. That would be nice. What? Jake, isn't she a little old for you? Does it matter? It was mine. We needed you to help us complete the ship. Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son. I knew that Jake would want to meet me, that I'd remind him of his mother. I think Jake would disagree. Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to fight the good fight for my people. I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. I can't. Because he won't leave me alone. [Klingon Bridge] (This ship is big, really big. It dwarfs it's Cardassian Galor-class escorts. Garak is lead in by a chain attached to a collar around his neck.) It was delicious. What do you call it? How did you learn to cook like this? Maybe one day I will. (Doorbell) Come in. How about some chicken a la Sisko? Jake made dinner. It's delicious. Oh, that's really not necessary. How's the work on the Defiant coming? Does that feel better? I don't expect to gain anything. I just want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I don't know why you're being so hard on me. After all, you pretended to be my husband and I've forgiven you. By the way, you have done a good job with him. Jake, I mean. Oh, he'll get over me. I wish I could say the same. Is it really a surprise? Think about it. My Ben Sisko is dead. I look at Jake and all I see is the son that I'll never have. Maybe bringing him here wasn't such a good idea after all. Come in? You look like you could use another pair of hands. Here, let me. Yes, I know. To control the inertial dampers. It's Professor Sisko, remember? For what it's worth, you should know that I've told Jake the truth. About my visit to you, why I brought him here, everything. And he said that it doesn't matter. That he's still glad to have met me. Funny thing is, I know he means it. It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. No one has ever cared about me like that before. So, if it's all right with you, I will see to it that he is sent back to Deep Space Nine. Right away. He trusts you to finish your job. And so do I. Would you like to say goodbye to him? Ben? When we first met there was a connection between us. And now, because of what I've done, it's gone, isn't it? I'd better go get Jake home. [Terok Nor Promenade - upper level] (Yup, it's at that location again.) Jake, I need to speak with you. In private. Believe me, Jake, It's better in the long run if I don't. For all of us. (And they walk round the corner to see the Intendant and her weapon.) You want me to go with you, fine. But leave the boy here. That doesn't matter. You're not taking him. No! (Jennifer is shot instead.) Ben. I knew we were still connected.

My mother warned me to watch out for junior officers. You're awfully sure of yourself. Do you use this routine a lot with women? Sure. I don't know. I'll probably be sorry. (The orb appears) It is corporeal. A physical entity. Linear time. what is this? Does not exist yet? Jennifer. She is part of your existence. But she is part of your existence. Lost? what is this? It is inconceivable that any species could exist in such a manner. You are deceiving us. Pleasure? What is this? Then why do you exist here? You exist here. [Limbo] More of your kind. Wormhole? What is this? The child with Jennifer. Linear procreation? The sound of children playing. [Baseball field] You bring us here. The termination of their linear existence. (and she puts her hand on his cheek) You exist here. None of your past experiences helped prepare you for this consequence. So you choose to exist here. It is not linear. Mister Garak said you wanted to see me. If you're wondering when the new sensor array will be finished, the answer is Will that be all? I have to get back to work. Nothing you could tell me about Ben would interest me. I haven't even seen him in five years. Can I go now? Were other Terrans killed with him? All this killing, it has to stop. Hello, Ben. Please leave us. All right, I'm here. What did you want to see me about? Really? You never seemed interested in talking to me while we were married. Save the apologies, Ben. They're not going to work. You are without a doubt, the most insensitive, self-absorbed, egotistical I doubt it. You never listened to me before. You were always too busy trying to impress every woman who crossed your path. There were enough. And if it wasn't women, then it was that ship of yours. Sometimes I think it was the only thing you ever loved. Then why did you leave me to go run and play pirate for the Intendant? And now this Rebellion of yours. Do you know how many deaths you've caused? How much destruction? You're fighting because you like to fight, Benjamin. The only thing you've accomplished is to give the Alliance an excuse to treat the Terrans worse than before. I just hope that with your capture, this rebellion can be ended peacefully. Oh, I suppose you came here just to see me? Rescue me? I'm not going anywhere with you. I have a job to finish. That's right. All I want to do is to put an end to all this fighting. To force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement with the Alliance. The rebellion is killing people every day. It has to stop. You have no right to talk to me like that. Since when do you care about what happens to our people? You've never cared about anyone but yourself. How many times have I heard you say that? You guess? You're right about that. For a second, I almost believed you. You know what I wish? I wish I'd never met you. I don't know what you're talking about. The Alliance is your enemy, not mine. What if I am a prisoner? You want me to join the rebellion? What are you doing? You have a subdermal communicator? Do I have a choice? All right. But lets get one thing clear. I still hate you. You still haven't told me where we're going. Now what? Something tells me that's not part of your plan. What if we offer a trade? I stay here and she lets you live. Nothing. I believe you. (Sisko starts working a console.) Actually, for the first time since I've met him, he's not annoying me. In fact, he's been making a lot of sense. I'm a Terran. Dax tells me you're leaving. Then I guess this is goodbye. Why don't you start by telling me what happened to my husband? He's dead, isn't he? Don't be. Who are you, really? He seems like a good man. Oh, I'm sure Smiley'll find something to keep me busy. You're not really going to visit the Romulans, are you. Will I see you again? Thank you for rescuing me. You'd better go. I'm afraid I'm not your mother, Jake. That's right. And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? Well, here I am. I came here to see your father. We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. I see your father has told you all about us. I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. We'll wait. Thank you. That would be nice. What? Jake, isn't she a little old for you? Does it matter? It was mine. We needed you to help us complete the ship. Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son. I knew that Jake would want to meet me, that I'd remind him of his mother. I think Jake would disagree. Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to fight the good fight for my people. I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. I can't. Because he won't leave me alone. [Klingon Bridge] (This ship is big, really big. It dwarfs it's Cardassian Galor-class escorts. Garak is lead in by a chain attached to a collar around his neck.) It was delicious. What do you call it? How did you learn to cook like this? Maybe one day I will. (Doorbell) Come in. How about some chicken a la Sisko? Jake made dinner. It's delicious. Oh, that's really not necessary. How's the work on the Defiant coming? Does that feel better? I don't expect to gain anything. I just want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I don't know why you're being so hard on me. After all, you pretended to be my husband and I've forgiven you. By the way, you have done a good job with him. Jake, I mean. Oh, he'll get over me. I wish I could say the same. Is it really a surprise? Think about it. My Ben Sisko is dead. I look at Jake and all I see is the son that I'll never have. Maybe bringing him here wasn't such a good idea after all. Come in? You look like you could use another pair of hands. Here, let me. Yes, I know. To control the inertial dampers. It's Professor Sisko, remember? For what it's worth, you should know that I've told Jake the truth. About my visit to you, why I brought him here, everything. And he said that it doesn't matter. That he's still glad to have met me. Funny thing is, I know he means it. It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. No one has ever cared about me like that before. So, if it's all right with you, I will see to it that he is sent back to Deep Space Nine. Right away. He trusts you to finish your job. And so do I. Would you like to say goodbye to him? Ben? When we first met there was a connection between us. And now, because of what I've done, it's gone, isn't it? I'd better go get Jake home. [Terok Nor Promenade - upper level] (Yup, it's at that location again.) Jake, I need to speak with you. In private. Believe me, Jake, It's better in the long run if I don't. For all of us. (And they walk round the corner to see the Intendant and her weapon.) You want me to go with you, fine. But leave the boy here. That doesn't matter. You're not taking him. No! (Jennifer is shot instead.) Ben. I knew we were still connected.

My mother warned me to watch out for junior officers. You're awfully sure of yourself. Do you use this routine a lot with women? Sure. I don't know. I'll probably be sorry. (The orb appears) It is corporeal. A physical entity. Linear time. what is this? Does not exist yet? Jennifer. She is part of your existence. But she is part of your existence. Lost? what is this? It is inconceivable that any species could exist in such a manner. You are deceiving us. Pleasure? What is this? Then why do you exist here? You exist here. [Limbo] More of your kind. Wormhole? What is this? The child with Jennifer. Linear procreation? The sound of children playing. [Baseball field] You bring us here. The termination of their linear existence. (and she puts her hand on his cheek) You exist here. None of your past experiences helped prepare you for this consequence. So you choose to exist here. It is not linear. Mister Garak said you wanted to see me. If you're wondering when the new sensor array will be finished, the answer is Will that be all? I have to get back to work. Nothing you could tell me about Ben would interest me. I haven't even seen him in five years. Can I go now? Were other Terrans killed with him? All this killing, it has to stop. Hello, Ben. Please leave us. All right, I'm here. What did you want to see me about? Really? You never seemed interested in talking to me while we were married. Save the apologies, Ben. They're not going to work. You are without a doubt, the most insensitive, self-absorbed, egotistical I doubt it. You never listened to me before. You were always too busy trying to impress every woman who crossed your path. There were enough. And if it wasn't women, then it was that ship of yours. Sometimes I think it was the only thing you ever loved. Then why did you leave me to go run and play pirate for the Intendant? And now this Rebellion of yours. Do you know how many deaths you've caused? How much destruction? You're fighting because you like to fight, Benjamin. The only thing you've accomplished is to give the Alliance an excuse to treat the Terrans worse than before. I just hope that with your capture, this rebellion can be ended peacefully. Oh, I suppose you came here just to see me? Rescue me? I'm not going anywhere with you. I have a job to finish. That's right. All I want to do is to put an end to all this fighting. To force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement with the Alliance. The rebellion is killing people every day. It has to stop. You have no right to talk to me like that. Since when do you care about what happens to our people? You've never cared about anyone but yourself. How many times have I heard you say that? You guess? You're right about that. For a second, I almost believed you. You know what I wish? I wish I'd never met you. I don't know what you're talking about. The Alliance is your enemy, not mine. What if I am a prisoner? You want me to join the rebellion? What are you doing? You have a subdermal communicator? Do I have a choice? All right. But lets get one thing clear. I still hate you. You still haven't told me where we're going. Now what? Something tells me that's not part of your plan. What if we offer a trade? I stay here and she lets you live. Nothing. I believe you. (Sisko starts working a console.) Actually, for the first time since I've met him, he's not annoying me. In fact, he's been making a lot of sense. I'm a Terran. Dax tells me you're leaving. Then I guess this is goodbye. Why don't you start by telling me what happened to my husband? He's dead, isn't he? Don't be. Who are you, really? He seems like a good man. Oh, I'm sure Smiley'll find something to keep me busy. You're not really going to visit the Romulans, are you. Will I see you again? Thank you for rescuing me. You'd better go. I'm afraid I'm not your mother, Jake. That's right. And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? Well, here I am. I came here to see your father. We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. I see your father has told you all about us. I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. We'll wait. Thank you. That would be nice. What? Jake, isn't she a little old for you? Does it matter? It was mine. We needed you to help us complete the ship. Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son. I knew that Jake would want to meet me, that I'd remind him of his mother. I think Jake would disagree. Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to fight the good fight for my people. I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. I can't. Because he won't leave me alone. [Klingon Bridge] (This ship is big, really big. It dwarfs it's Cardassian Galor-class escorts. Garak is lead in by a chain attached to a collar around his neck.) It was delicious. What do you call it? How did you learn to cook like this? Maybe one day I will. (Doorbell) Come in. How about some chicken a la Sisko? Jake made dinner. It's delicious. Oh, that's really not necessary. How's the work on the Defiant coming? Does that feel better? I don't expect to gain anything. I just want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I don't know why you're being so hard on me. After all, you pretended to be my husband and I've forgiven you. By the way, you have done a good job with him. Jake, I mean. Oh, he'll get over me. I wish I could say the same. Is it really a surprise? Think about it. My Ben Sisko is dead. I look at Jake and all I see is the son that I'll never have. Maybe bringing him here wasn't such a good idea after all. Come in? You look like you could use another pair of hands. Here, let me. Yes, I know. To control the inertial dampers. It's Professor Sisko, remember? For what it's worth, you should know that I've told Jake the truth. About my visit to you, why I brought him here, everything. And he said that it doesn't matter. That he's still glad to have met me. Funny thing is, I know he means it. It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. No one has ever cared about me like that before. So, if it's all right with you, I will see to it that he is sent back to Deep Space Nine. Right away. He trusts you to finish your job. And so do I. Would you like to say goodbye to him? Ben? When we first met there was a connection between us. And now, because of what I've done, it's gone, isn't it? I'd better go get Jake home. [Terok Nor Promenade - upper level] (Yup, it's at that location again.) Jake, I need to speak with you. In private. Believe me, Jake, It's better in the long run if I don't. For all of us. (And they walk round the corner to see the Intendant and her weapon.) You want me to go with you, fine. But leave the boy here. That doesn't matter. You're not taking him. No! (Jennifer is shot instead.) Ben. I knew we were still connected.

My mother warned me to watch out for junior officers. You're awfully sure of yourself. Do you use this routine a lot with women? Sure. I don't know. I'll probably be sorry. (The orb appears) It is corporeal. A physical entity. Linear time. what is this? Does not exist yet? Jennifer. She is part of your existence. But she is part of your existence. Lost? what is this? It is inconceivable that any species could exist in such a manner. You are deceiving us. Pleasure? What is this? Then why do you exist here? You exist here. [Limbo] More of your kind. Wormhole? What is this? The child with Jennifer. Linear procreation? The sound of children playing. [Baseball field] You bring us here. The termination of their linear existence. (and she puts her hand on his cheek) You exist here. None of your past experiences helped prepare you for this consequence. So you choose to exist here. It is not linear. Mister Garak said you wanted to see me. If you're wondering when the new sensor array will be finished, the answer is Will that be all? I have to get back to work. Nothing you could tell me about Ben would interest me. I haven't even seen him in five years. Can I go now? Were other Terrans killed with him? All this killing, it has to stop. Hello, Ben. Please leave us. All right, I'm here. What did you want to see me about? Really? You never seemed interested in talking to me while we were married. Save the apologies, Ben. They're not going to work. You are without a doubt, the most insensitive, self-absorbed, egotistical I doubt it. You never listened to me before. You were always too busy trying to impress every woman who crossed your path. There were enough. And if it wasn't women, then it was that ship of yours. Sometimes I think it was the only thing you ever loved. Then why did you leave me to go run and play pirate for the Intendant? And now this Rebellion of yours. Do you know how many deaths you've caused? How much destruction? You're fighting because you like to fight, Benjamin. The only thing you've accomplished is to give the Alliance an excuse to treat the Terrans worse than before. I just hope that with your capture, this rebellion can be ended peacefully. Oh, I suppose you came here just to see me? Rescue me? I'm not going anywhere with you. I have a job to finish. That's right. All I want to do is to put an end to all this fighting. To force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement with the Alliance. The rebellion is killing people every day. It has to stop. You have no right to talk to me like that. Since when do you care about what happens to our people? You've never cared about anyone but yourself. How many times have I heard you say that? You guess? You're right about that. For a second, I almost believed you. You know what I wish? I wish I'd never met you. I don't know what you're talking about. The Alliance is your enemy, not mine. What if I am a prisoner? You want me to join the rebellion? What are you doing? You have a subdermal communicator? Do I have a choice? All right. But lets get one thing clear. I still hate you. You still haven't told me where we're going. Now what? Something tells me that's not part of your plan. What if we offer a trade? I stay here and she lets you live. Nothing. I believe you. (Sisko starts working a console.) Actually, for the first time since I've met him, he's not annoying me. In fact, he's been making a lot of sense. I'm a Terran. Dax tells me you're leaving. Then I guess this is goodbye. Why don't you start by telling me what happened to my husband? He's dead, isn't he? Don't be. Who are you, really? He seems like a good man. Oh, I'm sure Smiley'll find something to keep me busy. You're not really going to visit the Romulans, are you. Will I see you again? Thank you for rescuing me. You'd better go. I'm afraid I'm not your mother, Jake. That's right. And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? Well, here I am. I came here to see your father. We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. I see your father has told you all about us. I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. We'll wait. Thank you. That would be nice. What? Jake, isn't she a little old for you? Does it matter? It was mine. We needed you to help us complete the ship. Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son. I knew that Jake would want to meet me, that I'd remind him of his mother. I think Jake would disagree. Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to fight the good fight for my people. I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. I can't. Because he won't leave me alone. [Klingon Bridge] (This ship is big, really big. It dwarfs it's Cardassian Galor-class escorts. Garak is lead in by a chain attached to a collar around his neck.) It was delicious. What do you call it? How did you learn to cook like this? Maybe one day I will. (Doorbell) Come in. How about some chicken a la Sisko? Jake made dinner. It's delicious. Oh, that's really not necessary. How's the work on the Defiant coming? Does that feel better? I don't expect to gain anything. I just want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I don't know why you're being so hard on me. After all, you pretended to be my husband and I've forgiven you. By the way, you have done a good job with him. Jake, I mean. Oh, he'll get over me. I wish I could say the same. Is it really a surprise? Think about it. My Ben Sisko is dead. I look at Jake and all I see is the son that I'll never have. Maybe bringing him here wasn't such a good idea after all. Come in? You look like you could use another pair of hands. Here, let me. Yes, I know. To control the inertial dampers. It's Professor Sisko, remember? For what it's worth, you should know that I've told Jake the truth. About my visit to you, why I brought him here, everything. And he said that it doesn't matter. That he's still glad to have met me. Funny thing is, I know he means it. It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. No one has ever cared about me like that before. So, if it's all right with you, I will see to it that he is sent back to Deep Space Nine. Right away. He trusts you to finish your job. And so do I. Would you like to say goodbye to him? Ben? When we first met there was a connection between us. And now, because of what I've done, it's gone, isn't it? I'd better go get Jake home. [Terok Nor Promenade - upper level] (Yup, it's at that location again.) Jake, I need to speak with you. In private. Believe me, Jake, It's better in the long run if I don't. For all of us. (And they walk round the corner to see the Intendant and her weapon.) You want me to go with you, fine. But leave the boy here. That doesn't matter. You're not taking him. No! (Jennifer is shot instead.) Ben. I knew we were still connected.

My mother warned me to watch out for junior officers. You're awfully sure of yourself. Do you use this routine a lot with women? Sure. I don't know. I'll probably be sorry. (The orb appears) It is corporeal. A physical entity. Linear time. what is this? Does not exist yet? Jennifer. She is part of your existence. But she is part of your existence. Lost? what is this? It is inconceivable that any species could exist in such a manner. You are deceiving us. Pleasure? What is this? Then why do you exist here? You exist here. [Limbo] More of your kind. Wormhole? What is this? The child with Jennifer. Linear procreation? The sound of children playing. [Baseball field] You bring us here. The termination of their linear existence. (and she puts her hand on his cheek) You exist here. None of your past experiences helped prepare you for this consequence. So you choose to exist here. It is not linear. Mister Garak said you wanted to see me. If you're wondering when the new sensor array will be finished, the answer is Will that be all? I have to get back to work. Nothing you could tell me about Ben would interest me. I haven't even seen him in five years. Can I go now? Were other Terrans killed with him? All this killing, it has to stop. Hello, Ben. Please leave us. All right, I'm here. What did you want to see me about? Really? You never seemed interested in talking to me while we were married. Save the apologies, Ben. They're not going to work. You are without a doubt, the most insensitive, self-absorbed, egotistical I doubt it. You never listened to me before. You were always too busy trying to impress every woman who crossed your path. There were enough. And if it wasn't women, then it was that ship of yours. Sometimes I think it was the only thing you ever loved. Then why did you leave me to go run and play pirate for the Intendant? And now this Rebellion of yours. Do you know how many deaths you've caused? How much destruction? You're fighting because you like to fight, Benjamin. The only thing you've accomplished is to give the Alliance an excuse to treat the Terrans worse than before. I just hope that with your capture, this rebellion can be ended peacefully. Oh, I suppose you came here just to see me? Rescue me? I'm not going anywhere with you. I have a job to finish. That's right. All I want to do is to put an end to all this fighting. To force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement with the Alliance. The rebellion is killing people every day. It has to stop. You have no right to talk to me like that. Since when do you care about what happens to our people? You've never cared about anyone but yourself. How many times have I heard you say that? You guess? You're right about that. For a second, I almost believed you. You know what I wish? I wish I'd never met you. I don't know what you're talking about. The Alliance is your enemy, not mine. What if I am a prisoner? You want me to join the rebellion? What are you doing? You have a subdermal communicator? Do I have a choice? All right. But lets get one thing clear. I still hate you. You still haven't told me where we're going. Now what? Something tells me that's not part of your plan. What if we offer a trade? I stay here and she lets you live. Nothing. I believe you. (Sisko starts working a console.) Actually, for the first time since I've met him, he's not annoying me. In fact, he's been making a lot of sense. I'm a Terran. Dax tells me you're leaving. Then I guess this is goodbye. Why don't you start by telling me what happened to my husband? He's dead, isn't he? Don't be. Who are you, really? He seems like a good man. Oh, I'm sure Smiley'll find something to keep me busy. You're not really going to visit the Romulans, are you. Will I see you again? Thank you for rescuing me. You'd better go. I'm afraid I'm not your mother, Jake. That's right. And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? Well, here I am. I came here to see your father. We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. I see your father has told you all about us. I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. We'll wait. Thank you. That would be nice. What? Jake, isn't she a little old for you? Does it matter? It was mine. We needed you to help us complete the ship. Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son. I knew that Jake would want to meet me, that I'd remind him of his mother. I think Jake would disagree. Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to fight the good fight for my people. I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. I can't. Because he won't leave me alone. [Klingon Bridge] (This ship is big, really big. It dwarfs it's Cardassian Galor-class escorts. Garak is lead in by a chain attached to a collar around his neck.) It was delicious. What do you call it? How did you learn to cook like this? Maybe one day I will. (Doorbell) Come in. How about some chicken a la Sisko? Jake made dinner. It's delicious. Oh, that's really not necessary. How's the work on the Defiant coming? Does that feel better? I don't expect to gain anything. I just want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I don't know why you're being so hard on me. After all, you pretended to be my husband and I've forgiven you. By the way, you have done a good job with him. Jake, I mean. Oh, he'll get over me. I wish I could say the same. Is it really a surprise? Think about it. My Ben Sisko is dead. I look at Jake and all I see is the son that I'll never have. Maybe bringing him here wasn't such a good idea after all. Come in? You look like you could use another pair of hands. Here, let me. Yes, I know. To control the inertial dampers. It's Professor Sisko, remember? For what it's worth, you should know that I've told Jake the truth. About my visit to you, why I brought him here, everything. And he said that it doesn't matter. That he's still glad to have met me. Funny thing is, I know he means it. It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. No one has ever cared about me like that before. So, if it's all right with you, I will see to it that he is sent back to Deep Space Nine. Right away. He trusts you to finish your job. And so do I. Would you like to say goodbye to him? Ben? When we first met there was a connection between us. And now, because of what I've done, it's gone, isn't it? I'd better go get Jake home. [Terok Nor Promenade - upper level] (Yup, it's at that location again.) Jake, I need to speak with you. In private. Believe me, Jake, It's better in the long run if I don't. For all of us. (And they walk round the corner to see the Intendant and her weapon.) You want me to go with you, fine. But leave the boy here. That doesn't matter. You're not taking him. No! (Jennifer is shot instead.) Ben. I knew we were still connected.

My mother warned me to watch out for junior officers. You're awfully sure of yourself. Do you use this routine a lot with women? Sure. I don't know. I'll probably be sorry. (The orb appears) It is corporeal. A physical entity. Linear time. what is this? Does not exist yet? Jennifer. She is part of your existence. But she is part of your existence. Lost? what is this? It is inconceivable that any species could exist in such a manner. You are deceiving us. Pleasure? What is this? Then why do you exist here? You exist here. [Limbo] More of your kind. Wormhole? What is this? The child with Jennifer. Linear procreation? The sound of children playing. [Baseball field] You bring us here. The termination of their linear existence. (and she puts her hand on his cheek) You exist here. None of your past experiences helped prepare you for this consequence. So you choose to exist here. It is not linear. Mister Garak said you wanted to see me. If you're wondering when the new sensor array will be finished, the answer is Will that be all? I have to get back to work. Nothing you could tell me about Ben would interest me. I haven't even seen him in five years. Can I go now? Were other Terrans killed with him? All this killing, it has to stop. Hello, Ben. Please leave us. All right, I'm here. What did you want to see me about? Really? You never seemed interested in talking to me while we were married. Save the apologies, Ben. They're not going to work. You are without a doubt, the most insensitive, self-absorbed, egotistical I doubt it. You never listened to me before. You were always too busy trying to impress every woman who crossed your path. There were enough. And if it wasn't women, then it was that ship of yours. Sometimes I think it was the only thing you ever loved. Then why did you leave me to go run and play pirate for the Intendant? And now this Rebellion of yours. Do you know how many deaths you've caused? How much destruction? You're fighting because you like to fight, Benjamin. The only thing you've accomplished is to give the Alliance an excuse to treat the Terrans worse than before. I just hope that with your capture, this rebellion can be ended peacefully. Oh, I suppose you came here just to see me? Rescue me? I'm not going anywhere with you. I have a job to finish. That's right. All I want to do is to put an end to all this fighting. To force the rebels to seek a peaceful settlement with the Alliance. The rebellion is killing people every day. It has to stop. You have no right to talk to me like that. Since when do you care about what happens to our people? You've never cared about anyone but yourself. How many times have I heard you say that? You guess? You're right about that. For a second, I almost believed you. You know what I wish? I wish I'd never met you. I don't know what you're talking about. The Alliance is your enemy, not mine. What if I am a prisoner? You want me to join the rebellion? What are you doing? You have a subdermal communicator? Do I have a choice? All right. But lets get one thing clear. I still hate you. You still haven't told me where we're going. Now what? Something tells me that's not part of your plan. What if we offer a trade? I stay here and she lets you live. Nothing. I believe you. (Sisko starts working a console.) Actually, for the first time since I've met him, he's not annoying me. In fact, he's been making a lot of sense. I'm a Terran. Dax tells me you're leaving. Then I guess this is goodbye. Why don't you start by telling me what happened to my husband? He's dead, isn't he? Don't be. Who are you, really? He seems like a good man. Oh, I'm sure Smiley'll find something to keep me busy. You're not really going to visit the Romulans, are you. Will I see you again? Thank you for rescuing me. You'd better go. I'm afraid I'm not your mother, Jake. That's right. And I was married to a man who looked exactly like your father. It's all a little confusing, isn't it? Well, here I am. I came here to see your father. We've driven the Alliance off of the space station. I see your father has told you all about us. I understand. It's not like you were expecting me. Is it all right if I visit with Jake for a while? Maybe the three of us can have dinner together. We'll wait. Thank you. That would be nice. What? Jake, isn't she a little old for you? Does it matter? It was mine. We needed you to help us complete the ship. Smiley told me all about you. About your wife's death, about your son. I knew that Jake would want to meet me, that I'd remind him of his mother. I think Jake would disagree. Ben, you're the one that convinced me to join the rebels, to fight the good fight for my people. I'm sorry if Jake's feelings get hurt, but that's a small price to pay if it means success against the Alliance. I can't. Because he won't leave me alone. [Klingon Bridge] (This ship is big, really big. It dwarfs it's Cardassian Galor-class escorts. Garak is lead in by a chain attached to a collar around his neck.) It was delicious. What do you call it? How did you learn to cook like this? Maybe one day I will. (Doorbell) Come in. How about some chicken a la Sisko? Jake made dinner. It's delicious. Oh, that's really not necessary. How's the work on the Defiant coming? Does that feel better? I don't expect to gain anything. I just want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I don't know why you're being so hard on me. After all, you pretended to be my husband and I've forgiven you. By the way, you have done a good job with him. Jake, I mean. Oh, he'll get over me. I wish I could say the same. Is it really a surprise? Think about it. My Ben Sisko is dead. I look at Jake and all I see is the son that I'll never have. Maybe bringing him here wasn't such a good idea after all. Come in? You look like you could use another pair of hands. Here, let me. Yes, I know. To control the inertial dampers. It's Professor Sisko, remember? For what it's worth, you should know that I've told Jake the truth. About my visit to you, why I brought him here, everything. And he said that it doesn't matter. That he's still glad to have met me. Funny thing is, I know he means it. It's more than that. I don't think he could be angry with me even if he wanted to. I remind him too much of his mother. No one has ever cared about me like that before. So, if it's all right with you, I will see to it that he is sent back to Deep Space Nine. Right away. He trusts you to finish your job. And so do I. Would you like to say goodbye to him? Ben? When we first met there was a connection between us. And now, because of what I've done, it's gone, isn't it? I'd better go get Jake home. [Terok Nor Promenade - upper level] (Yup, it's at that location again.) Jake, I need to speak with you. In private. Believe me, Jake, It's better in the long run if I don't. For all of us. (And they walk round the corner to see the Intendant and her weapon.) You want me to go with you, fine. But leave the boy here. That doesn't matter. You're not taking him. No! (Jennifer is shot instead.) Ben. I knew we were still connected.
