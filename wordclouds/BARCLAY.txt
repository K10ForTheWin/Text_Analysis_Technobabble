Doctor, am I glad to see you. Can you see me? Sir, it's me. It's Lieutenant Barclay. Reg. Your assistant. Uh-oh. Oh, no, this is bad. This is very bad. Don't panic. Let's just try to think our way through this. Oh, boy. The Voyager. Oh, boy. This is going to sound a little crazy from your perspective, but you've got to trust me. None of this is happening. This is all a holographic simulation that you've been running. You're in the holodeck at the Jupiter Station. Your name is Doctor Lewis Zimmerman, you're a holo-engineer and you've been running a programme that's malfunctioning and we've been trying to reach you. Well, I always used to think of you that way and I know your wife tends to think We'd, er, we'd better take this one step at a time. Well, you see, this starship, it's not really a starship. [Doctor's office] It was a programme that you wrote to study the psychological impact of long term isolation on a crew made up of Starfleet and Maquis crewmembers. I'm afraid not. This must have something to do with the radiation surge. We've been having problems shutting the programme down because of a kinoplasmic radiation surge on the station. It's affected all of the computer systems, including the holodecks. The radiation must be affecting the memory centres of your brain. I'm not really here. Clearly, I'm here because we're talking. You see, what I mean is, I'm in a control booth outside of the holodeck. What you see is a projection of my body so that we can communicate. We've been trying to get in here, or send a comm. signal in for nearly six hours. You haven't been here six months. You've only been here six hours. That's all part of the simulation. Look, Doctor, it's very important that you believe me. You're losing your sense of identity. You're starting to think that you're part of the programme and that's, that's not good. It's called HTDS. Holo Transference Dementia Syndrome. No. Yes. I mean, maybe the radiation. Doctor, I'm sorry I have to do this. (Barclay slaps the EMH's face.) It hurt, right? If you were a programme it wouldn't hurt. Doctor. (The EMH slaps Barclay.) I'll be back. I've got to discuss this with the others. Don't, don't go anywhere. (Barclay vanishes.) The problem is worse than we thought. The radiation is disrupting the command protocols. We can't shut the programme down, and while the programme is running we can't access the holodeck grid. We tried, but the radiation is interfering with the transporters and we can't get a lock on you. I've consulted with our neurologist, Doctor Kaplin, and he said if we can't get you out of here within the next hour, that the radiation would completely oxidise your neurocellular structures. There's only one way left to terminate the programme, and that's to play it out. Bring it to it's conclusion and once the simulation ends, it'll release the access locks on the holodeck arch and we can get you out of here. You programmed two possible outcomes. Either Voyager finds its way back to Federation space, or it's destroyed in the process. But the simulation was designed to run for weeks before either happens. But I know of a way that you can bring it to an end right now. Destroy the ship. This is just a simulation, Lewis. None of this is real. And unless you destroy this ship that you think you're on, you're going to die. Doctor, it's the only way. Well, those are good questions. First, I can tell you how to destroy the Voyager. Second, if you don't do it, you're going to die. And third. Well, I'm just not an alien and I don't know how else to convince you of that. You are the one running the simulation. It's coded to respond to your input, not mine. Here, use this tricorder. Scan the room outwards to a distance of fifteen metres. You see? Scan me. You'll see I'm a holographic projection originating from beyond that wall. There has to be some way to convince you. Oh, I know. I'll be right back. (Barclay vanishes. The Sickbay changes from empty to full, with flickering lights.) Now do you believe me? This is the beginning of the simulation. We can't shut down the programme but we can restart it. Actually, I programmed him. I modelled him after my cousin Frank. Are you convinced yet? So what are you going to do now? Yes. But if you destroy it and you're still here And you'll know that I'm telling you the truth. What's wrong? That's because you're a Oh, don't mind me, I'm just assisting the Doctor. The computer's not responding to vocal commands. The protocols are starting to freeze up. We don't have much time. Don't worry, those phasers aren't real, they're just holograms. That means the holodeck safeties are off. Time is running out, Doctor. The oxidation levels in your neural tissues are rising. You've got to destroy this ship and bring this programme to an end. Well, except for me. I'm being projected from outside the simulation. Go ahead, give it a try. (Barclay hands the EMH a phaser. They move back to the warp core and the EMH shoots out the circuits.) Convinced? Doctor, I know this is a little confusing, but try to remember you just destroyed the holographic imaging system on a holographic ship. A hologram in a hologram. If you want to bring this to an end you've got to destroy the entire simulation. The ship itself. And you're a person in great danger. Destroy the ship. Now, before it's too late. Doctor, you've got to believe me. What else can I do to prove it to you? There. Do you see what's happening? Holograms don't feel pain. Your brain is being flooded with kinoplasmic radiation. You're dying. The warp core. Even set on full power it's going to take a sustained phaser burst to punch through the outer duranium shielding. Set your phaser to maximum. Aim for the magnetic constrictors. Ready? Don't be distracted by these holographic characters. Stay focused on what you need to do. Destroy the warp core. The programme is malfunctioning. Doctor, do you remember coming into the holodeck and running a holonovel within the last six hours? You don't have memory circuits, you have a mind, and it's being damaged. Destroy the Voyager, the programme will end, and we can get you off the holodeck. Only real people experience pain. You've got to believe me. Do nothing and you'll die. (The EMH collapses.) I told you, his brain is being damaged. He's losing his memory. This is Kes Zimmerman, your wife. Lewis, how would you rather think of yourself? As a real person with a real life, with a family that loves you? Or as some hologram that exists in a Sickbay on a starship lost in deep space. It's not too late, Lewis. You can still save yourself by destroying the warp core. (The headaches return.) I am helping you.
