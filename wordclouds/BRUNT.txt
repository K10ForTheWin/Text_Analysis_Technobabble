You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)

Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing.

It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment.

I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful.

[Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance.

Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes.

Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here.

You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary.

Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark.

And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA.

My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet.

I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness.

I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry.

Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)

And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant.

It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise.

Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead.

Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any?

So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt.

And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible.

My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet.

You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA.

Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him.

Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear.

If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused.

It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment.

Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant.

It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise.

What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power.

I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here.

As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA.

No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that.

Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox.

You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain.

I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear.

You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.)

She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing.

It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment.

One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone.

[Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark.

Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes.

Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here.

And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary.

Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark.

However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA.

My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today.

I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me.

I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked.

All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
You must be Quark. Brunt. FCA. Hard work, bribes, sucking up to the boss. Just like any other job. Are these all your assets? You realise concealing financial information from the FCA could result in severe fines? We'll see. Yes. Please provide a dermal imprint for FCA records. No. I haven't. You're being charged with violating Ferengi Trade Bylaws subsection one thousand twenty seven, paragraph three. Well in that case you need a copy of the Bylaws. You are being held accountable for the criminal activities of one Ishka, daughter of Adred, wife of Keldar. She's charged with earning profit. As are its contents. (They finish towelling off.) Excuse me for interrupting, but we do have business to attend to. As a registered liquidator, it's my duty to present a formal list of the infractions committed by your mother. You have three days to obtain an admission of guilt from the accused. If you're not able to obtain a confession, your mother will be placed in indentured servitude and you will be required to make restitution for her crimes. Do you understand everything I've said to you? Your mother is wearing clothes. Perhaps I should leave. Was she addressing me? Perhaps you do, but I will not stand here and be spoken to by a female. You have three days to get your house in order. (Brunt leaves.) Everything seems to be in order. I'm glad we can finally put an end to this matter. And I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. She's speaking to me again. Ah, the lesson is, no one can outsmart the FCA. Your mother's confession will serve as a warning to females all over the Alliance. I shudder to think. Goodbye. I sincerely hope I never see any of you again. Ah. It's about time you got back. That's Liquidator Brunt to you. I see you remember me. (Brunt is accompanied by two Nausicaans.) Quark, don't worry. I'm here to help. The Ferengi Commerce Authority has ordered me to end this nasty little labour dispute of yours. By any means necessary. [Rom's quarters] Brunt, FCA. If this was Ferenginar, I'd have you all taken to the Spire of the Tower of Commerce, displayed to the crowds in the Great Marketplace below, then shoved off, one by one. Small children would bet on where you would land, and your spattered remains would be sold as feed mulch for gree-worms. Lucky for you. But the FCA understands that living on this station has (looks at Leeta and gets distracted) corrupted you. You've been tempted by unwholesome Bajoran ideals, exposed to the twisted values of the Federation. And because of that, we are willing to forgive. But don't confuse our mercy with weakness. If you are not back at your jobs tomorrow morning, your financial accounts on Ferenginar will be confiscated, your families fined and your trading permits revoked. You'll be ruined, reduced to utter destitution. Am I understood? Good. I thought so. Don't bother getting up. (Brunt and Co leave) I'm sure it does. Most Nausicaan games do. Speaking of pain. Did you talk to your brother? And? Time, like latinum, is a highly limited commodity. Wrong. I'm here to enforce Ferengi law and to protect Ferengi traditions. And that means ending this strike. Now I can see we are going to have to make an example of someone. Oh, I'm sure that we'll come up with something that will get people's attention. I wasn't thinking of him. Attack the leader of a movement, you risk creating a martyr. No, Rom must not be touched. Our target must be someone unexpected, someone he cares about. Like that dabo girl. I know. That's what makes it so memorable. But she has such delicate lobes. I'm afraid I couldn't bring myself to give the order. Let's see. Who else does Rom care about? Boys. (The Nausicaans come over.) Ironic, isn't it. [Infirmary] (Quark is on a bed with a device on his forehead.) Brunt. FCA. Not this time. I'm here to check on my merchandise. I'm talking about you. I paid five hundred bars of latinum for your desiccated remains and I'm here to collect. Who did you expect? The Nagus? You mean that you don't have Dorek Syndrome? I know all about it. I'm here to get what I paid for. The contract calls for fifty discs of vacuum-desiccated Quark available within six days. I'm here to make sure you deliver the merchandise. Maybe I wasn't clear. I don't care. I want my merchandise. I have a thousand ideas of how to defile your remains. Want to hear my favourites? What I want is fifty two disks of vacuum-desiccated Quark. Nothing more, nothing less. Of course not. You can have someone do it for you. I recommend strangulation. It leaves the body relatively unmarked for desiccation. A contract is a contract This is not business, Quark. This is personal. Done to me? And you call your brother an idiot? Nothing you've ever done to me has been more than a minor inconvenience. No. Protecting your mother from an FCA audit, and secretly settling with your striking employees were nothing more than symptoms of a vile and insidious weakness. A weakness that makes me loath you, not for what you've done but for who you are, what you are. A philanthropist. You give your customers credit at the bar. You only take a thirty percent kickback from your employees' tips, and you sold food and medicine to Bajoran refugees at cost! Close enough. It was still a generous, humanitarian gesture. You've gone Starfleet. You might as well be wearing one of their uniforms. It's people like you that give honest Ferengi businessmen a bad name. You gave them vacations? You disgust me. Of course there is. You can break the contract. Never? I wonder if there's enough Ferengi left in you to stick to that. Part of me hopes you will break it because then everything you and your family own on Ferenginar will be confiscated and sold to the lowest bidder. Your mother will be forced to live in the streets, begging for scraps of food and of course no Ferengi will do business with you, or even talk to you. You'll be cut off from all contact with your own people. Well, we don't feel comfortable around you. You're a disease, Quark. A festering tumour on the lobes of Ferengi society. And it's my job to cut you off. [O'Brien's quarters] (Keiko is out of bed.) Quark, hold it right there. Brunt, FCA. I'm here to remind you of the consequences of disregarding the Rules. Poverty, destitution, exile. That is not Gint. Gint was a lot taller. You listen to that fraud, you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life. This is a dream. You can't kill me. However, people have been known to die in their sleep. (Brunt starts choking Quark.) I find it surprising that someone with such long, slender and nimble fingers has never practiced oo-mox. (Quark comes up and she leaves.) Come to beg for your life? What is this? I told you I wasn't interested in a refund. Ah ha. I knew it. You're just like the rest of your family. Weak-lobed degenerates. Another loser in a long line of failed Ferengis. Yes? May I have your attention, please! Brunt, FCA. As of this moment, no further Ferengi commerce may be conducted in this bar. No Ferengi may be employed by this bar. No Ferengi may eat or drink in this bar. And no Ferengi, no Ferengi, may do business with that man! (Brunt slaps the notice up by the door.) Confiscation of assets will begin immediately. Brunt, FCA. Conducting official FCA business. I didn't want the happy couple to see me. Don't play innocent with me. I know all about their perverted little love affair. She's your mother, Quark, and that makes you responsible. And right now, she's endangering the very foundation of Ferengi society. I can see her, whispering in the Nagus' ear, contaminating his thoughts with her twisted, female philosophies. I'm telling you, Quark, if we don't put an end to their relationship, you're going to see clothed females walking down the streets of Ferenginar in broad daylight. If I had my way, I'd climb to the top of the Tower of Commerce and denounce your mother to the crowd below. But we must spare the Nagus even a hint of public disgrace. We've got to put an end to their relationship, but privately. Quietly. I'm not going to do anything. You are. Who else? She's your mother and the Nagus, for reasons that elude me completely, likes you. You're in the perfect position to poison their relationship. I'll give you a new one. Brunt, FCA. You're smiling, Quark. Therefore, I assume you mother is not. As of this moment, it's as valid as my own. Congratulations, Quark. You're a Ferengi again. (Transmission ends.) My, aren't we early today. But I suppose, after yesterday's fiasco, we have no alternative. A hundred and ninety nine point plummet. Haven't seen that steep a market slide since Grand Nagus Smeet. And you know what happened to him? What was the name of his First Clerk? I believe they buried them together. No, you won't. The Market Exchange will remain closed today. The FCA Board of Liquidators has called an emergency meeting with the Grand Nagus. We have some questions to ask him. And by the time we're through you'll both be out of a job. Everything. (Brunt sits on the throne.) Grand Nagus Brunt. Daddy will be so proud. You mean about Zek's failing memory? Let me think. Well, you know, now that you mention it, yes, I did. I couldn't have done it without you. I feel almost grateful. Which is why I'm going to let you keep your new business licence. Now, put down those PADDS, pack your things, and scurry on back to that little bar of yours. [Ishka's house] Brunt, FCA. Don't worry about me, Quark. I'm a survivor. So, the happy couple are back together. If the people only knew. Really? Why shouldn't I? I hate losing. I may not be able to destroy the Nagus but you are a different story. On the contrary. I want you back in business. It gives me an opportunity to keep my eye on you, because one day you are going to make a mistake, and on that day you're going to lose more than your licence. It's not over, Quark. That's ex-liquidator Brunt. Thanks to your brother, I'm no longer with the Ferengi Commerce Authority. A child, a moron, a failure and a psychopath. Quite a little team you've put together. I'm here to sign up. I'm going to help you rescue your mother. I know a lot of things. When do we leave? Fine. I'll just get in my ship and leave. (Brunt heads for the door, and a knife thuds into the doorframe.) That's right. Why? Don't shoot! I surrender! (The Jem'Hadar shoot Brunt. Leck shoots Ishka.) Maybe we should start off with something easier. Like ambushing a couple of Bolians. You don't like it here, leave. Why would the Dominion pick a deserted Cardassian space station to make the trade? You were guarding him. Someone turned the alarm off. One of us should go check to make sure. I nominate Quark. He's right. Everything's going according to plan. Now all you have to do, Quark, is negotiate the prisoner exchange. Remember, be firm, strong. Don't listen to him. He's just trying to save his own neck. You know what I miss most? The rotting vegetation. Fifty bars? You said the reward was twenty. Then what about the other thirty bars? You're not going to get away with this, Quark. If they find out Keevan's dead they're going to kill us. I have a better idea. Let's sneak back to my ship and try to escape. Let's do it for equal shares of fifty bars of gold pressed latinum. What do we do with this one? Care to place a wager on that? (Enter the new Nagus with his own Hupyrian servant.) I'll take an Eelwasser. No ice. That's Grand Nagus Brunt. Would someone please tell that female to take off those clothes. It's disgusting. Over my dead body. You're right. That's not why I'm here. Though I find it ironic that helping to rescue your mother was the first step on my road to becoming Nagus. But you did. And as a Liquidator, I was able to bribe my way back into a position of power. Face it, Zek, it's over. You're finished. Bankrupt. I'm going to liquidate you. Cancel that Eelwasser and get me a Slug-o-Cola instead. On second thought, I'll just wait till Chairman Nilva gets here. I'm sure he'll be happy to provide his new Nagus with all the Slug-o-Cola I can drink. Because it's my business to know. Go on, have your little meeting. Whatever you offer Nilva, I'll double it. You dare threaten your Nagus? I'm going to make you a pauper. Uri'lash, we're leaving. Say goodbye to these poor people. The only thing to do is get down on your knees and beg for mercy. Who knows? You might find me in a charitable mood. Such brave words, yet so empty. I was very relieved to hear your mother is going to be all right. Of course, it doesn't do you much good. Nilva will be arriving tonight expecting to meet a brilliant Ferengi female. Do you know any? I mean, besides Ishka? I certainly don't. (Maihar'du stops Zek from attacking Brunt.) How pitiful. One day you're the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler. You see what happens when you put your faith in a female? (Brunt and Uri'lash leave.) Nilva! How nice to see you again. I thought after your meeting with Zek, we could have a little chat. Haven't you heard? Ishka's in the Infirmary. She's in no position to meet anyone. Never heard of her. I didn't know there were two Ferengi females on the station. Lumba? [Rom's quarters] Let go of that man! His name's not Lumba, it's Quark, and he's a male. How pitiful. Zek must be truly desperate. Nice try, Quark, but it's not going to work. He's the station's bartender. I tell you that is not a female. But why? His name's Quark! [Quark's] (Quark is back to full male, but holding a ring.) Sorry. Been a little busy. I had to break into the cargo bay, steal back the cloaking device you lost and get it onto our ship. And on top of that I'm working on it. (Gives up working the controls and blasts them instead. Ezri and Brunt embrace.) You two must be hungry. I've got food and drink waiting for you on the ship. More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)

More tube grubs? In case you get hungry. I put a cup of hot tea by your bunk. You should get some rest. I'll wake you long before that. (Ezri leaves.) I'd like to see the look on Bashir's face when he discovers we've stolen back the cloaking device. Oh, they can't let the Regent get his hands on that technology. I hate the Alliance. Ezri and I are partners. More than that. She's the closest friend I've ever had. Not as close as I'd like. I'm not her type. And I don't think you are either. Let's just say that when it comes to men, she's very particular. [Klingon Bridge] (Worf gives a Klingon Sneeze, the only kind he knows.) It's a little late to back out now, Quark. Is that really necessary? They could come in handy. I just don't feel right about this. Quark and Rom deserve better. That's just it. I can't. I like them and so do you. Talk to the Intendant. She listens to you. Tell her the Ferengi kept their part of the bargain. We should do the same. Maybe now's a good time to start. No, not this time. What do we gain from their deaths? Nothing. On the other hand, if we let them live, they may come in handy. The Regent will give them to you. All you have to do is ask. Ferenginar is rife with rumours. They say the Grand Nagus is coming to DS Nine to name his successor. I see. (Brunt falls to his knees and kisses Quark's hand.) A thousand congratulations, my Nagus! It's never too early to suck up to the boss. I do have lots of connections on Ferenginar. I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind. Would forty bricks of gold pressed latinum do the trick? Fifty. Done. If you'll sign this. A receipt. Surely you're aware of the new regulation making all bribes tax deductible. You mean tax? You haven't been keeping up with the latest reforms, have you? Zek instituted progressive income tax three months ago. The government needed revenues to fund the new social programmes. Wage subsidies for the poor, retirement benefits for the aged, health care for Things change. Oh, I'm not sure the Congress of Economic Advisors will approve. Not anymore. All regulations proposed by the Nagus have to be ratified by the Congress before they become law. You'll still be a powerful man. I wouldn't be sucking up to you otherwise. (Quark kneels in front of his idol.) It always brings a tear to my eye to see a Nagus pass his staff to his successor. It's a privilege to witness such a historic moment. May I be the first to offer my congratulations. (Maihar'du pushes Brunt aside.) I know someone who's available How can I serve you, my (Nog marches Brunt away.)
