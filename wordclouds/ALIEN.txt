Point four three.
How do you regulate positron flow in your dilithium matrix?
Captain, I'm glad you could come.
Alien vessel. Reduce to one quarter power and adjust heading to three one seven mark five.
(something) (something) (something increasingly belligerent) (something) (something) (something) (something) (Hoshi goes to investigate again, and sees a pale scaled alien fixing devices to the bulkheads and talking to a companion who is doing the same.) [Ready room] (Archer is pacing when Hoshi walks through the closed door.)
 Our warp drive failed three weeks after we left. We tried to set a course for the nearest system at impulse, but main power went down.
(grey skin, slightly beaky mouth) Prepare to surrender your vessel and evacuate the crew. You won't be harmed if you co-operate. Drop out of warp.
Several compartments have flooded with radiation. I have injured passengers and crew. Our situation is critical!
We've detected three more infected organisms on the surface.
I don't recognise your species. You must be newcomers. Welcome. It would be a shame if I let you leave our world without introducing you to the local wildlife. Zentho marmots make wonderful pets, and the flesh is quite succulent when prepared properly. Barge twelve is that way. Tier two. [Chemist's shop]
You're not like the others on this ship.
It's holding! [Bridge]
Transmit your identification code. You're cleared to proceed. [Transporter alcove] (Archer arrives in casual clothes with Soong and his shadows, and meets Phlox, who injects Soong with something.)
He promised he'd kill us if we told you. Please! His name is Slar. Our slave master. He was in charge of the salvage operation. When you boarded the ship, he hid in the service crawlways. He was planning to sabotage the ship. Possibly near the power transfer conduits on deck twenty two. It's warm there. His species likes it warm. Gorn. He's he's a Gorn.

How do you regulate positron flow in your dilithium matrix?
Trenakadula ta? Morana dona? Kandala vaganish. Yoreta vala? (Hoshi nods.) Who are you? What planet? This is a warp vessel? We left Valakis over a year ago, along with three other ships. You must have noticed our condition by now. Twelve million of us died the year before we left. I can only imagine how many have died since. Our doctors can't find a cure, but a more advanced people, people with warp technology, like you, your medical science must be more effective. The M'klexa and the Ferengi. They both visited our world. Do you know them? Are you the ship's doctor? My people are dying. Will you allow him to help us? (Archer and T'Pol walk away a little to discuss.) Thank you. The medication you gave us helps with the pain, but my prognosis hasn't changed. I wanted to thank you for getting me home before it was too late. It took us a year to get out to where you found us. You brought us home in a day. Someday may not be soon enough. If your doctor can't help us we need to keep searching for others that can. We need warp drive. A million more of us will die before our next ship even leaves this system. With warp engines we won't have to wait for people to find us. We can seek help on our own. Still, we have to try. (comm. beep.)

Quiet! Nothing. It's too risky. We could sell their clothes.

You had no right to bring me here. I didn't ask for your help. Return me to my ship. That's none of your concern. I'm not answering any of your questions. Take me back to my ship! I was sent against my will. I am not from your part of space. I come from a trans-dimensional realm. I don't know why I was sent here. It's the truth. I was a prisoner. Because of my transgressions, I've spent my entire adult life inside a cell. One day the guards offered me freedom if I would participate in an experiment. I agreed. That's all I remember before I woke up here. The experiment was important to them. They wouldn't abandon me. Take me back. If you don't, I'll die. Please. (his hand disappears and reappears) What's happening to me? What's happening to me? Captain's starlog, supplemental. With Travis's adjustments in place, we've resumed course for the red giant. [T'Pol's quarters] What are they called, your two worlds? Am I going to die? I'm grateful to you for trying, Doctor. When the Xindi destroy Earth, my people will prevail. (The alien vanishes.

(female) That's fine. I'll be right back. Would you like to meet them? I can arrange it. I'll show you where, but first you should enjoy yourselves. Which one would you prefer? Gentlemen, gentlemen. Perhaps you would prefer to watch the inter-species performance? Of course I do, but there's no reason to hurry. Point four three. Reactor room to Ah'len. The coils are coming back online. How do you regulate positron flow in your dilithium matrix? Trenakadula ta? Morana dona? Kandala vaganish. Yoreta vala? (Hoshi nods.) Who are you? What planet? This is a warp vessel? We left Valakis over a year ago, along with three other ships. You must have noticed our condition by now. Twelve million of us died the year before we left. I can only imagine how many have died since. Our doctors can't find a cure, but a more advanced people, people with warp technology, like you, your medical science must be more effective. The M'klexa and the Ferengi. They both visited our world. Do you know them? Are you the ship's doctor? My people are dying. Will you allow him to help us? (Archer and T'Pol walk away a little to discuss.) Thank you. The medication you gave us helps with the pain, but my prognosis hasn't changed. I wanted to thank you for getting me home before it was too late. It took us a year to get out to where you found us. You brought us home in a day. Someday may not be soon enough. If your doctor can't help us we need to keep searching for others that can. We need warp drive. A million more of us will die before our next ship even leaves this system. With warp engines we won't have to wait for people to find us. We can seek help on our own. Still, we have to try. (comm. beep.) Alien vessel.

[Ready room] (Archer is pacing when Hoshi walks through the closed door.)  Our warp drive failed three weeks after we left. We tried to set a course for the nearest system at impulse, but main power went down. I don't know. Six weeks, maybe more. We diverted auxiliary power to life support, but it wasn't enough. Food processors failed, water recyclers. When we left there were fifty four aboard. Several years ago, our colony was annexed by a species we had never seen before. They said they'd provide for us in exchange for our allegiance, that we'd become a part of their Empire. But they stripped us of our resources, left us with nothing. We waited for them to return. They said they'd bring food, fuel. They never came back. [Hall of Justice] (grey skin, slightly beaky mouth) Prepare to surrender your vessel and evacuate the crew.
