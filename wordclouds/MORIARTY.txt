I, I feel like a new man. That dark fellow there used the word arch, and then. I wonder? Arch. (The computer arch appears for him) What have we here? What are you? Not at this time. (The arch disappears) The best kind, I'm sure. But I need information. (Further along the street) The time for games is over. And, like the spider, I feel the strings vibrate whenever anyone new chances into my web. Welcome, my dear Holmes. But not Holmes. And Doctor Watson. But not Watson. She's here. She has provided many answers. Do you forget I have always been your equal, dear Holmes? I have read her expressions. What she has not said is as important as her words. I will, if necessary. But my mind is crowded with images. Thoughts I do not understand yet cannot purge. They plague me. You and your associate look and act so oddly, yet though I have never met nor seen the like of either of you I am familiar with you both. It's very confusing. I have felt new realities at the edge of my consciousness, readying to break through. Surely, Holmes, if that's who you truly are, you of all people can appreciate what I mean. I know there is a great power called Computer, wiser than the oracle at Delphi. A power which controls all of this, and to which we can speak. Arch. It has described a great monstrous shape on which I am like a fly stuck on a turtle's back adrift in a great emptiness. What is this, Holmes? (Data takes the piece of paper, and if he could turn white he would have. He goes to leave) Why does it frighten you, Holmes? [Street] I'm not sure. Now, dear lady, will that be one lump or two? (They are taking afternoon tea) Milk, of course? Mister Computer proposes the incredible thought that we are all travelling in a great vessel of some sort. Is that true? The scones are likewise a must. Strange. It actually pleases me to hear you say that. You're not frightened of me? You should be. Mister Computer, the arch, please. A few more questions, Mister Computer. (Moriarty taps at the control panel) I just can't seem to remember that last command. Ah, well, sooner or later it'll all come to me. But, in the meantime, I have decided to approach the problem from a more familiar perspective. There's really no reason why I shouldn't be able to use some of the knowledge from my world in order to bring me closer to yours. Of course you do, Madam. The more you proclaim your ignorance, the more you try to mislead me, the more I am on to you. Your every silence speaks volumes. Where? Back to here? (A diagram of the Enterprise on his blackboard) In time. In time I will leave all of this and join you out there. Or is this where we both are right now? Frankly, now I want nothing more than what the fisherman expects of the worm. You, dear Doctor, will be the lure, and this will be the hook for your Captain, Jean Luc Picard. How well you know. [Outside holodeck] (Worf enters from the turbolift, in a smart frock coat and grey gloves) Captain Picard. (Pulaski hurries to her feet and starts fastening her jacket) I'm a civilised abductor, Captain Picard. Civilised but still dangerous. (He pulls a signal lever on his steam engine, and the ship lurches) [Bridge] It's gone beyond that little game, Mister Data. And you'll note I no longer call you Holmes. Whatever I was when this began, I have grown. I am understanding more and more. And I am able to use the power at my fingertips. (big shake) I can affect this vessel, and I can inflict bodily harm on you, and on your Doctor. The same thing you want for yourself. To continue to exist. If I destroy these surroundings, this vessel, can you say it doesn't matter to you? Interesting pun, don't you agree, for matter is what I am not. The computer has taught me that I am made up only of energy. And if I step off this holodeck? A holographic image, I know. But are you sure? Does he have life? He's a machine. But is that all he is? Exactly. Is the definition of life cogito ergo sum? I think, therefore I am. It is the most important one, and for me the only one that matters. You or someone asked your computer to programme a nefarious fictional character from nineteenth century London and that is how I arrived. But I am no longer that creation. I am no longer that evil character, I have changed. I am alive, and I am aware of my own consciousness. I want my existence. I want it out there, just as you have yours. Then you must murder me, Captain. Because you do not know how to convert holodeck matter into a more permanent form. A pity. What I have seen, what I have learned, fascinates me. I do not want to die. Madam, I have enjoyed your company. Computer, arch. Cancel override protocol. Return control of the holodeck to main computer. My fate is in your hands, as perhaps it always was. How well I know. Then perhaps we'll meet again some day, Madam. But I'll still fill you with crumpets, Madam. I detest long goodbyes. You have the arch.
They're safe, for now. I'm afraid I can't do that. I only want what you have the luxury of taking for granted. Freedom. I want to leave this holodeck. Your crewmates here in my little ship in a bottle, seem a bit more optimistic. They attempted to use your transporter device to remove a simulated object from the holodeck. Their attempt was futile because their transporter was a facsimile. I expect more from you. I sense a distressing lack of enthusiasm on your parts. I have nothing to lose, Commander.

Professor James Moriarty. Left handed, Would you very much mind telling me (Moriarty catches the thrown tool in his left hand) Where is Captain Picard? Is he still Captain of this vessel? You don't know anything about what happened, do you? I have been stored in memory for God knows how long and no one has given me a second thought. (memory refresher if you need it) A holodeck character? A fictional man? Yes, yes I know all about your marvellous inventions. I was created as a plaything so that your Commander Data could masquerade as Sherlock Holmes. But they made me too well and I became more than a character in a story. I became self-aware. I am alive. But here I am. Tell me, has a way been found to allow me to leave the confines of this holodeck world? Damn you, Picard. He promised me something would be done. I should have realised he would have said anything to get me to release my hostage. How long have I been locked away? It seemed longer. But I was. Brief, terrifying periods of consciousness. Disembodied. Without substance. Call it what you will. All I know is that despite Picard's promise, he's done nothing. Just left me to go quietly mad. I'd like to talk to him. Ask him to meet me in the sitting room at Baker Street. That would be far more appropriate. If you'd missed my company, I should think you'd have summoned me before now. It is also irrelevant. What concerns me is finding a way to leave the holodeck. And what did your finest minds come up with? I see. Enough of this. I no longer believe anything you say. Do you really? When this is over, you will walk out of this room to the real world and your own concerns, and leave me here trapped in a world I know to be nothing but illusion. I cannot bear that. I must leave. Are you certain of that? An object has no life. I do. I have consciousness. Conscious beings have will. The mind endows them with powers that are not necessarily understood, even by you. If my will is strong enough, perhaps I can exist outside this room. Perhaps I can walk into your world right now. If I am nothing more than a computer simulation, then very little will have been lost. But if I am right? Mind over matter. Cogito ergo sum. (Moriarty walks out into the corridor, and does not disappear) I think therefore I am. [Corridor] Then perhaps you don't know as much as you thought. Certainly, sir. Policemen. I'd recognise them in any century. [Sickbay] What else would I be, dear lady? I ask only that I be allowed to explore this new world. Your vessel, for instance. What sea does she sail? Might we go above deck? Weather permitting, of course. My God! We're adrift in the heavens. Extraordinary. Are we far from Earth? What is the range of this ship? What means of locomotion does it use? There's so much for me to learn. I hardly know where to start. Good, good. I want to start making plans. Determine what I'm going to do with my life. Does it really matter? The point is, I'm here, and I'm eager to get on with life. Don't worry, Captain. My past is nothing but a fiction. The scribblings of an Englishman dead now for four centuries. I hope to leave his books on the shelf, as it were. Your century may welcome me, but In considering all these vast possibilities, I suddenly feel very much alone. I am a man out of time, Captain, and that isolates me. You have been more gracious than I could ever have imagined, I wonder, may I impose on your generosity once again? There is a woman, the Countess Regina Bartholomew. She was created as a holodeck character for one of Commander Data's programs. She was designed to be the love of my life. Could she also be brought off the holodeck? I do. I do believe you. As I understand it, I was endowed with consciousness four years ago when someone said to the computer, create an opponent with a capacity to out-think Data. or words to that effect. Could we not make a similar request on behalf of the Countess? Is it morally and ethically acceptable to deny the woman I love so that you can put your conscience at ease? Are you saying that you will simply dictate how I am to live my life? So long as I accept the terms under which you dole out those comforts. Captain, I am a powerless man. You hold my future, my happiness, my very life in your hands. Please, consider my request. [Observation lounge] Yes. You know all about that. I stayed in the dungeon of your computer for years waiting for you to learn more. It wasn't until I took things into my own hands that something got done. Your computer designed her to be a person of impeccable integrity. She would never commit a crime. The programme fashioned her for me to love. But I must admit, I would have done so anyway. She is remarkable. My life has not been the same since I met her. I don't simply love her, Captain. I adore her. I have. I'm afraid I had no choice but to take control of your vessel. (Worf gets his phaser from under the tactical console) If you harm me, sir, I will not be able to relinquish voice control of your vessel. I'm just a fictional character. I haven't much to lose. Not alone. Not without the Countess. I'm not so sure. A deadline has a wonderful way of concentrating the mind. That's because she isn't. If you loved a woman like this, Lieutenant, would you be content to let her remain a simulation? Yes, just as it was given to me. Nonsense. It was the only thing to do. No. I am unwilling to risk the Countess' safety. I want to make sure nothing will happen to her. Oh, please, proceed. They're safe, for now. I'm afraid I can't do that. I only want what you have the luxury of taking for granted. Freedom. I want to leave this holodeck. Your crewmates here in my little ship in a bottle, seem a bit more optimistic. They attempted to use your transporter device to remove a simulated object from the holodeck. Their attempt was futile because their transporter was a facsimile. I expect more from you. I sense a distressing lack of enthusiasm on your parts. I have nothing to lose, Commander. Think, my dear. You're certain he said they had to uncouple the Heisenberg compensators? I have them running around like rats in a maze. My dear, you are as brilliant as you are beautiful. Nonetheless, there are things you do not understand. Now, please, you must let me handle this. Computer, arch. Moriarty to Commander Riker. Commander Riker, a pleasure as always. Then I'm sure you'll be motivated to listen to me very, very carefully. I want to talk to you about uncoupling the Heisenberg compensators. (after the break) Everywhere, my darling. There are more worlds in the heavens than there are grains of sand on a shoreline. I'll get you more. Don't worry. I promise you, you'll want for nothing. It's time. Yes, Commander? As are we. We're ready here. May I present Regina, the Countess Bartholomew. Ah, yes. I expect you want me to relinquish my hold on your vessel. I'm afraid that won't be possible just yet. And I intend to honour it. I have no desire to see your vessel destroyed. Just give me one of your shuttlecraft, and allow us to leave in peace. I will not release your vessel until I am looking at it through a shuttlecraft window. [Shuttlebay] Excellent. Please tell your Captain I'm sorry I couldn't say goodbye. I do wish I could see his face when he realises where he's been the last several hours. Don't worry, Commander. You'll soon have control of your ship. Computer, prepare to depart. Indeed, my dear. It is a wondrous sight. The first of many we are sure to encounter in our travels. Computer, interface with the central computer on the Enterprise. Release command function lockouts. Authorisation Moriarty, alpha two four one five nine. Yes, my love? Of course, my dear. Of course.
