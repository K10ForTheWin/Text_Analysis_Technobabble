Benjamin! You do recognise me, don't you? Don't tell me. The nose gave me away. What's the matter? Aren't you happy to see me? It's all right. I told her I wanted to come see you, that we'd meet up later at Quark's. I'm going to give that little toad the scare of his life. I am Odo. I'm both. The Guardian thinks it has something to do with my shape-shifting nature. It's as if Odo and Curzon have been joined. It's proving to be quite interesting experience for both of us. In any case, the Guardian says it's nothing to worry about. I like the beard, by the way. (And 'Curzon' pours himself a drink.) Absolutely. So, when is Kasidy Yates coming back? She's a fine looking woman, Ben. Kind of reminds me of the girl you took up with on Pelios Station. I'll tell you all about it later. Quark! Never mind my face. (And kisses Quark on the forehead) Did I ever mention you're a magnificent scoundrel. Two  Tranyas please, very cold. Jadzia! Well, as good a time as two gentlemen can have without the company of a lady. Please, join us. Excuse me while I slip into something more appropriate. (And morphs into a colourful new outfit.) I love being a changeling. Benjamin, don't go. Well, there goes the best friend I ever had. Well? (Curzon takes the drinks off stunned Quark.) So, are you been enjoying your zhian'tara? What about that Tobin, eh? Did he tell you that I got him drunk for the first time during my zhian'tara? Oh? Do you see that Ferengi over there? A bulletin came in on him last week. He's a tongo hustler. I'd love to clean him out. We should get a game going. (It's now late, and the tongo game is still going) Tongo! Sorry, Lonzo. I am security. I confiscated this from a Yridian smuggler. Bah. I know you do. So, what is it you want to ask me? I don't know, Jadzia. Maybe I decided I'd been too hard on you. Yes, but the truth is, I felt sorry for you. Well, you wanted to be joined so badly. You were so young, so lovely. Whatever I may have thought doesn't matter. You are a host. Isn't that enough? In that case, you'll be happy to know that I've come to a decision that's going to benefit both of us. I've decided to stay where I am, in this body. And I'm not just speaking as Curzon. This is Odo's decision as well. We like what we've become and neither of us wants to go back to the way things were. [Commander's office] Jadzia, come in, come in. I was just oozing around the room. You have no idea what a liberating experience it is to be in a liquid state. All right. What is it you want to talk about? I'm sorry. I realise this is difficult for you, but you'll get over it. Trust me, it's better this way. Not anymore. Maybe they never should've been. The only reason you got back in was because I felt sorry for you. Now don't you use that tone of voice with me, little girl. No, I suppose you're not. The truth is, you weren't a little girl back when you were an Initiate. You were a brilliant and beautiful young woman. Very beautiful. At first I thought it was just an old man's passing infatuation. After all, I'd always had an eye for the ladies. But as we spent more time together, I started to realise it was something deeper. I couldn't let you know the truth. You were an Initiate, I was your supervisor. Later I realised that I'd robbed you of something you'd wanted all your life. I felt so guilty I nearly retired from the Symbiosis Commission. On the contrary. I was grateful when you'd reapplied. It let me off the hook. So now that you know, you can see that it's best for both of us that I stay here, in this body. Because I still love you. Yes, there is, and if we rejoined, you'll feel it too.

I told her I wanted to come see you, that we'd meet up later at Quark's. I'm going to give that little toad the scare of his life. I am Odo. I'm both. The Guardian thinks it has something to do with my shape-shifting nature. It's as if Odo and Curzon have been joined. It's proving to be quite interesting experience for both of us. In any case, the Guardian says it's nothing to worry about. I like the beard, by the way. (And 'Curzon' pours himself a drink.) Absolutely. So, when is Kasidy Yates coming back? She's a fine looking woman, Ben. Kind of reminds me of the girl you took up with on Pelios Station. I'll tell you all about it later. Quark! Never mind my face. (And kisses Quark on the forehead) Did I ever mention you're a magnificent scoundrel. Two  Tranyas please, very cold. Jadzia! Well, as good a time as two gentlemen can have without the company of a lady. Please, join us. Excuse me while I slip into something more appropriate. (And morphs into a colourful new outfit.) I love being a changeling. Benjamin, don't go. Well, there goes the best friend I ever had. Well? (Curzon takes the drinks off stunned Quark.) So, are you been enjoying your zhian'tara? What about that Tobin, eh? Did he tell you that I got him drunk for the first time during my zhian'tara? Oh? Do you see that Ferengi over there? A bulletin came in on him last week. He's a tongo hustler. I'd love to clean him out. We should get a game going. (It's now late, and the tongo game is still going) Tongo! Sorry, Lonzo. I am security. I confiscated this from a Yridian smuggler. Bah. I know you do. So, what is it you want to ask me? I don't know, Jadzia. Maybe I decided I'd been too hard on you. Yes, but the truth is, I felt sorry for you. Well, you wanted to be joined so badly. You were so young, so lovely. Whatever I may have thought doesn't matter. You are a host. Isn't that enough? In that case, you'll be happy to know that I've come to a decision that's going to benefit both of us. I've decided to stay where I am, in this body. And I'm not just speaking as Curzon. This is Odo's decision as well. We like what we've become and neither of us wants to go back to the way things were. [Commander's office] Jadzia, come in, come in. I was just oozing around the room. You have no idea what a liberating experience it is to be in a liquid state. All right. What is it you want to talk about? I'm sorry. I realise this is difficult for you, but you'll get over it. Trust me, it's better this way. Not anymore. Maybe they never should've been. The only reason you got back in was because I felt sorry for you. Now don't you use that tone of voice with me, little girl. No, I suppose you're not. The truth is, you weren't a little girl back when you were an Initiate. You were a brilliant and beautiful young woman. Very beautiful. At first I thought it was just an old man's passing infatuation. After all, I'd always had an eye for the ladies. But as we spent more time together, I started to realise it was something deeper. I couldn't let you know the truth. You were an Initiate, I was your supervisor. Later I realised that I'd robbed you of something you'd wanted all your life. I felt so guilty I nearly retired from the Symbiosis Commission. On the contrary. I was grateful when you'd reapplied. It let me off the hook. So now that you know, you can see that it's best for both of us that I stay here, in this body. Because I still love you. Yes, there is, and if we rejoined, you'll feel it too.

I told her I wanted to come see you, that we'd meet up later at Quark's. I'm going to give that little toad the scare of his life. I am Odo. I'm both. The Guardian thinks it has something to do with my shape-shifting nature. It's as if Odo and Curzon have been joined. It's proving to be quite interesting experience for both of us. In any case, the Guardian says it's nothing to worry about. I like the beard, by the way. (And 'Curzon' pours himself a drink.) Absolutely. So, when is Kasidy Yates coming back? She's a fine looking woman, Ben. Kind of reminds me of the girl you took up with on Pelios Station. I'll tell you all about it later. Quark! Never mind my face. (And kisses Quark on the forehead) Did I ever mention you're a magnificent scoundrel. Two  Tranyas please, very cold. Jadzia! Well, as good a time as two gentlemen can have without the company of a lady. Please, join us. Excuse me while I slip into something more appropriate. (And morphs into a colourful new outfit.) I love being a changeling. Benjamin, don't go. Well, there goes the best friend I ever had. Well? (Curzon takes the drinks off stunned Quark.) So, are you been enjoying your zhian'tara? What about that Tobin, eh? Did he tell you that I got him drunk for the first time during my zhian'tara? Oh? Do you see that Ferengi over there? A bulletin came in on him last week. He's a tongo hustler. I'd love to clean him out. We should get a game going. (It's now late, and the tongo game is still going) Tongo! Sorry, Lonzo. I am security. I confiscated this from a Yridian smuggler. Bah. I know you do. So, what is it you want to ask me? I don't know, Jadzia. Maybe I decided I'd been too hard on you. Yes, but the truth is, I felt sorry for you. Well, you wanted to be joined so badly. You were so young, so lovely. Whatever I may have thought doesn't matter. You are a host. Isn't that enough? In that case, you'll be happy to know that I've come to a decision that's going to benefit both of us. I've decided to stay where I am, in this body. And I'm not just speaking as Curzon. This is Odo's decision as well. We like what we've become and neither of us wants to go back to the way things were. [Commander's office] Jadzia, come in, come in. I was just oozing around the room. You have no idea what a liberating experience it is to be in a liquid state. All right. What is it you want to talk about? I'm sorry. I realise this is difficult for you, but you'll get over it. Trust me, it's better this way. Not anymore. Maybe they never should've been. The only reason you got back in was because I felt sorry for you. Now don't you use that tone of voice with me, little girl. No, I suppose you're not. The truth is, you weren't a little girl back when you were an Initiate. You were a brilliant and beautiful young woman. Very beautiful. At first I thought it was just an old man's passing infatuation. After all, I'd always had an eye for the ladies. But as we spent more time together, I started to realise it was something deeper. I couldn't let you know the truth. You were an Initiate, I was your supervisor. Later I realised that I'd robbed you of something you'd wanted all your life. I felt so guilty I nearly retired from the Symbiosis Commission. On the contrary. I was grateful when you'd reapplied. It let me off the hook. So now that you know, you can see that it's best for both of us that I stay here, in this body. Because I still love you. Yes, there is, and if we rejoined, you'll feel it too.

I told her I wanted to come see you, that we'd meet up later at Quark's. I'm going to give that little toad the scare of his life. I am Odo. I'm both. The Guardian thinks it has something to do with my shape-shifting nature. It's as if Odo and Curzon have been joined. It's proving to be quite interesting experience for both of us. In any case, the Guardian says it's nothing to worry about. I like the beard, by the way. (And 'Curzon' pours himself a drink.) Absolutely. So, when is Kasidy Yates coming back? She's a fine looking woman, Ben. Kind of reminds me of the girl you took up with on Pelios Station. I'll tell you all about it later. Quark! Never mind my face. (And kisses Quark on the forehead) Did I ever mention you're a magnificent scoundrel. Two  Tranyas please, very cold. Jadzia! Well, as good a time as two gentlemen can have without the company of a lady. Please, join us. Excuse me while I slip into something more appropriate. (And morphs into a colourful new outfit.) I love being a changeling. Benjamin, don't go. Well, there goes the best friend I ever had. Well? (Curzon takes the drinks off stunned Quark.) So, are you been enjoying your zhian'tara? What about that Tobin, eh? Did he tell you that I got him drunk for the first time during my zhian'tara? Oh? Do you see that Ferengi over there? A bulletin came in on him last week. He's a tongo hustler. I'd love to clean him out. We should get a game going. (It's now late, and the tongo game is still going) Tongo! Sorry, Lonzo. I am security. I confiscated this from a Yridian smuggler. Bah. I know you do. So, what is it you want to ask me? I don't know, Jadzia. Maybe I decided I'd been too hard on you. Yes, but the truth is, I felt sorry for you. Well, you wanted to be joined so badly. You were so young, so lovely. Whatever I may have thought doesn't matter. You are a host. Isn't that enough? In that case, you'll be happy to know that I've come to a decision that's going to benefit both of us. I've decided to stay where I am, in this body. And I'm not just speaking as Curzon. This is Odo's decision as well. We like what we've become and neither of us wants to go back to the way things were. [Commander's office] Jadzia, come in, come in. I was just oozing around the room. You have no idea what a liberating experience it is to be in a liquid state. All right. What is it you want to talk about? I'm sorry. I realise this is difficult for you, but you'll get over it. Trust me, it's better this way. Not anymore. Maybe they never should've been. The only reason you got back in was because I felt sorry for you. Now don't you use that tone of voice with me, little girl. No, I suppose you're not. The truth is, you weren't a little girl back when you were an Initiate. You were a brilliant and beautiful young woman. Very beautiful. At first I thought it was just an old man's passing infatuation. After all, I'd always had an eye for the ladies. But as we spent more time together, I started to realise it was something deeper. I couldn't let you know the truth. You were an Initiate, I was your supervisor. Later I realised that I'd robbed you of something you'd wanted all your life. I felt so guilty I nearly retired from the Symbiosis Commission. On the contrary. I was grateful when you'd reapplied. It let me off the hook. So now that you know, you can see that it's best for both of us that I stay here, in this body. Because I still love you. Yes, there is, and if we rejoined, you'll feel it too.

I told her I wanted to come see you, that we'd meet up later at Quark's. I'm going to give that little toad the scare of his life. I am Odo. I'm both. The Guardian thinks it has something to do with my shape-shifting nature. It's as if Odo and Curzon have been joined. It's proving to be quite interesting experience for both of us. In any case, the Guardian says it's nothing to worry about. I like the beard, by the way. (And 'Curzon' pours himself a drink.) Absolutely. So, when is Kasidy Yates coming back? She's a fine looking woman, Ben. Kind of reminds me of the girl you took up with on Pelios Station. I'll tell you all about it later. Quark! Never mind my face. (And kisses Quark on the forehead) Did I ever mention you're a magnificent scoundrel. Two  Tranyas please, very cold. Jadzia! Well, as good a time as two gentlemen can have without the company of a lady. Please, join us. Excuse me while I slip into something more appropriate. (And morphs into a colourful new outfit.) I love being a changeling. Benjamin, don't go. Well, there goes the best friend I ever had. Well? (Curzon takes the drinks off stunned Quark.) So, are you been enjoying your zhian'tara? What about that Tobin, eh? Did he tell you that I got him drunk for the first time during my zhian'tara? Oh? Do you see that Ferengi over there? A bulletin came in on him last week. He's a tongo hustler. I'd love to clean him out. We should get a game going. (It's now late, and the tongo game is still going) Tongo! Sorry, Lonzo. I am security. I confiscated this from a Yridian smuggler. Bah. I know you do. So, what is it you want to ask me? I don't know, Jadzia. Maybe I decided I'd been too hard on you. Yes, but the truth is, I felt sorry for you. Well, you wanted to be joined so badly. You were so young, so lovely. Whatever I may have thought doesn't matter. You are a host. Isn't that enough? In that case, you'll be happy to know that I've come to a decision that's going to benefit both of us. I've decided to stay where I am, in this body. And I'm not just speaking as Curzon. This is Odo's decision as well. We like what we've become and neither of us wants to go back to the way things were. [Commander's office] Jadzia, come in, come in. I was just oozing around the room. You have no idea what a liberating experience it is to be in a liquid state. All right. What is it you want to talk about? I'm sorry. I realise this is difficult for you, but you'll get over it. Trust me, it's better this way. Not anymore. Maybe they never should've been. The only reason you got back in was because I felt sorry for you. Now don't you use that tone of voice with me, little girl. No, I suppose you're not. The truth is, you weren't a little girl back when you were an Initiate. You were a brilliant and beautiful young woman. Very beautiful. At first I thought it was just an old man's passing infatuation. After all, I'd always had an eye for the ladies. But as we spent more time together, I started to realise it was something deeper. I couldn't let you know the truth. You were an Initiate, I was your supervisor. Later I realised that I'd robbed you of something you'd wanted all your life. I felt so guilty I nearly retired from the Symbiosis Commission. On the contrary. I was grateful when you'd reapplied. It let me off the hook. So now that you know, you can see that it's best for both of us that I stay here, in this body. Because I still love you. Yes, there is, and if we rejoined, you'll feel it too.

I told her I wanted to come see you, that we'd meet up later at Quark's. I'm going to give that little toad the scare of his life. I am Odo. I'm both. The Guardian thinks it has something to do with my shape-shifting nature. It's as if Odo and Curzon have been joined. It's proving to be quite interesting experience for both of us. In any case, the Guardian says it's nothing to worry about. I like the beard, by the way. (And 'Curzon' pours himself a drink.) Absolutely. So, when is Kasidy Yates coming back? She's a fine looking woman, Ben. Kind of reminds me of the girl you took up with on Pelios Station. I'll tell you all about it later. Quark! Never mind my face. (And kisses Quark on the forehead) Did I ever mention you're a magnificent scoundrel. Two  Tranyas please, very cold. Jadzia! Well, as good a time as two gentlemen can have without the company of a lady. Please, join us. Excuse me while I slip into something more appropriate. (And morphs into a colourful new outfit.) I love being a changeling. Benjamin, don't go. Well, there goes the best friend I ever had. Well? (Curzon takes the drinks off stunned Quark.) So, are you been enjoying your zhian'tara? What about that Tobin, eh? Did he tell you that I got him drunk for the first time during my zhian'tara? Oh? Do you see that Ferengi over there? A bulletin came in on him last week. He's a tongo hustler. I'd love to clean him out. We should get a game going. (It's now late, and the tongo game is still going) Tongo! Sorry, Lonzo. I am security. I confiscated this from a Yridian smuggler. Bah. I know you do. So, what is it you want to ask me? I don't know, Jadzia. Maybe I decided I'd been too hard on you. Yes, but the truth is, I felt sorry for you. Well, you wanted to be joined so badly. You were so young, so lovely. Whatever I may have thought doesn't matter. You are a host. Isn't that enough? In that case, you'll be happy to know that I've come to a decision that's going to benefit both of us. I've decided to stay where I am, in this body. And I'm not just speaking as Curzon. This is Odo's decision as well. We like what we've become and neither of us wants to go back to the way things were. [Commander's office] Jadzia, come in, come in. I was just oozing around the room. You have no idea what a liberating experience it is to be in a liquid state. All right. What is it you want to talk about? I'm sorry. I realise this is difficult for you, but you'll get over it. Trust me, it's better this way. Not anymore. Maybe they never should've been. The only reason you got back in was because I felt sorry for you. Now don't you use that tone of voice with me, little girl. No, I suppose you're not. The truth is, you weren't a little girl back when you were an Initiate. You were a brilliant and beautiful young woman. Very beautiful. At first I thought it was just an old man's passing infatuation. After all, I'd always had an eye for the ladies. But as we spent more time together, I started to realise it was something deeper. I couldn't let you know the truth. You were an Initiate, I was your supervisor. Later I realised that I'd robbed you of something you'd wanted all your life. I felt so guilty I nearly retired from the Symbiosis Commission. On the contrary. I was grateful when you'd reapplied. It let me off the hook. So now that you know, you can see that it's best for both of us that I stay here, in this body. Because I still love you. Yes, there is, and if we rejoined, you'll feel it too.

I told her I wanted to come see you, that we'd meet up later at Quark's. I'm going to give that little toad the scare of his life. I am Odo. I'm both. The Guardian thinks it has something to do with my shape-shifting nature. It's as if Odo and Curzon have been joined. It's proving to be quite interesting experience for both of us. In any case, the Guardian says it's nothing to worry about. I like the beard, by the way. (And 'Curzon' pours himself a drink.) Absolutely. So, when is Kasidy Yates coming back? She's a fine looking woman, Ben. Kind of reminds me of the girl you took up with on Pelios Station. I'll tell you all about it later. Quark! Never mind my face. (And kisses Quark on the forehead) Did I ever mention you're a magnificent scoundrel. Two  Tranyas please, very cold. Jadzia! Well, as good a time as two gentlemen can have without the company of a lady. Please, join us. Excuse me while I slip into something more appropriate. (And morphs into a colourful new outfit.) I love being a changeling. Benjamin, don't go. Well, there goes the best friend I ever had. Well? (Curzon takes the drinks off stunned Quark.) So, are you been enjoying your zhian'tara? What about that Tobin, eh? Did he tell you that I got him drunk for the first time during my zhian'tara? Oh? Do you see that Ferengi over there? A bulletin came in on him last week. He's a tongo hustler. I'd love to clean him out. We should get a game going. (It's now late, and the tongo game is still going) Tongo! Sorry, Lonzo. I am security. I confiscated this from a Yridian smuggler. Bah. I know you do. So, what is it you want to ask me? I don't know, Jadzia. Maybe I decided I'd been too hard on you. Yes, but the truth is, I felt sorry for you. Well, you wanted to be joined so badly. You were so young, so lovely. Whatever I may have thought doesn't matter. You are a host. Isn't that enough? In that case, you'll be happy to know that I've come to a decision that's going to benefit both of us. I've decided to stay where I am, in this body. And I'm not just speaking as Curzon. This is Odo's decision as well. We like what we've become and neither of us wants to go back to the way things were. [Commander's office] Jadzia, come in, come in. I was just oozing around the room. You have no idea what a liberating experience it is to be in a liquid state. All right. What is it you want to talk about? I'm sorry. I realise this is difficult for you, but you'll get over it. Trust me, it's better this way. Not anymore. Maybe they never should've been. The only reason you got back in was because I felt sorry for you. Now don't you use that tone of voice with me, little girl. No, I suppose you're not. The truth is, you weren't a little girl back when you were an Initiate. You were a brilliant and beautiful young woman. Very beautiful. At first I thought it was just an old man's passing infatuation. After all, I'd always had an eye for the ladies. But as we spent more time together, I started to realise it was something deeper. I couldn't let you know the truth. You were an Initiate, I was your supervisor. Later I realised that I'd robbed you of something you'd wanted all your life. I felt so guilty I nearly retired from the Symbiosis Commission. On the contrary. I was grateful when you'd reapplied. It let me off the hook. So now that you know, you can see that it's best for both of us that I stay here, in this body. Because I still love you. Yes, there is, and if we rejoined, you'll feel it too.

I told her I wanted to come see you, that we'd meet up later at Quark's. I'm going to give that little toad the scare of his life. I am Odo. I'm both. The Guardian thinks it has something to do with my shape-shifting nature. It's as if Odo and Curzon have been joined. It's proving to be quite interesting experience for both of us. In any case, the Guardian says it's nothing to worry about. I like the beard, by the way. (And 'Curzon' pours himself a drink.) Absolutely. So, when is Kasidy Yates coming back? She's a fine looking woman, Ben. Kind of reminds me of the girl you took up with on Pelios Station. I'll tell you all about it later. Quark! Never mind my face. (And kisses Quark on the forehead) Did I ever mention you're a magnificent scoundrel. Two  Tranyas please, very cold. Jadzia! Well, as good a time as two gentlemen can have without the company of a lady. Please, join us. Excuse me while I slip into something more appropriate. (And morphs into a colourful new outfit.) I love being a changeling. Benjamin, don't go. Well, there goes the best friend I ever had. Well? (Curzon takes the drinks off stunned Quark.) So, are you been enjoying your zhian'tara? What about that Tobin, eh? Did he tell you that I got him drunk for the first time during my zhian'tara? Oh? Do you see that Ferengi over there? A bulletin came in on him last week. He's a tongo hustler. I'd love to clean him out. We should get a game going. (It's now late, and the tongo game is still going) Tongo! Sorry, Lonzo. I am security. I confiscated this from a Yridian smuggler. Bah. I know you do. So, what is it you want to ask me? I don't know, Jadzia. Maybe I decided I'd been too hard on you. Yes, but the truth is, I felt sorry for you. Well, you wanted to be joined so badly. You were so young, so lovely. Whatever I may have thought doesn't matter. You are a host. Isn't that enough? In that case, you'll be happy to know that I've come to a decision that's going to benefit both of us. I've decided to stay where I am, in this body. And I'm not just speaking as Curzon. This is Odo's decision as well. We like what we've become and neither of us wants to go back to the way things were. [Commander's office] Jadzia, come in, come in. I was just oozing around the room. You have no idea what a liberating experience it is to be in a liquid state. All right. What is it you want to talk about? I'm sorry. I realise this is difficult for you, but you'll get over it. Trust me, it's better this way. Not anymore. Maybe they never should've been. The only reason you got back in was because I felt sorry for you. Now don't you use that tone of voice with me, little girl. No, I suppose you're not. The truth is, you weren't a little girl back when you were an Initiate. You were a brilliant and beautiful young woman. Very beautiful. At first I thought it was just an old man's passing infatuation. After all, I'd always had an eye for the ladies. But as we spent more time together, I started to realise it was something deeper. I couldn't let you know the truth. You were an Initiate, I was your supervisor. Later I realised that I'd robbed you of something you'd wanted all your life. I felt so guilty I nearly retired from the Symbiosis Commission. On the contrary. I was grateful when you'd reapplied. It let me off the hook. So now that you know, you can see that it's best for both of us that I stay here, in this body. Because I still love you. Yes, there is, and if we rejoined, you'll feel it too.
