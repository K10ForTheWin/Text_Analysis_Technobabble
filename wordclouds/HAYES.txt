Ma'am. We've familiarised ourselves with all the Bridge officers, Ensign. I'm Major Hayes, this is Sergeant Kemper, Corporals Romero and Chang. Captain Archer wanted the best. Ensign Sato's a linguist, Kemper. You give her enough time, she could probably tell you what street you grew up on. Let's hope it's soon. The quicker you folks find these Xindi, the quicker we can get to work. We have a briefing in a few minutes. If you'll excuse you. [Corridor] It's a simple matter of priorities. If those warships get here before we return from the surface, you could find yourselves dealing with a boarding party. You'd be in far better hands with a security force who knows Enterprise inside and out. With all due respect, sir, we can't be certain of that. Very good, sir. (Hayes leaves.) Fayette, go. (The MACO sets up his night scope and shoots the Foreman between the eyes. The second shuttlepod appears out of the gloom.)
Reptilian? Two spatial charges. That's all it would take to destroy the complex from orbit. That's up to Captain Archer. I'm afraid you're going to have to stay right here. And I'm under orders. Please sit down. Captain. Sir. The suppressors are in place. The blast wave should be mostly confined to the facility. Sir, I noticed a lot of activity down there. It seemed like something is going on. Yes, sir. He could lead the reptilians back here. Just offering a tactical assessment, sir. Stand by, Captain.  [Refinery fence] You're clear, sir. (Archer heads in through the hole he cut earlier. Reed and Hayes watch as he runs over to the Reptilian ship.)  [Bridge]
Okay, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday. How does oh eight hundred sound. We incorporate elements from numerous disciplines. It's extremely effective in hand to hand situations. What I'd like to do now is break up into sparring pairs, run through some of the moves you just saw. Let's get started. (Tucker pairs up with Cole, the other senior staff with other MACOs, T'Pol is watching Tucker get his bottom slapped when she gets floored by a simple punch.)
Go ahead, Captain. Aye, sir.
Where's Corporal Hawkins? I'm sure you did everything you could. I'd appreciate a full report. [Degra's quarters] Ready to deploy on your command. Your place is on the Bridge, sir. Thank you. Would you like to go over my rescue plan? Sir? Permission to speak freely? I've never liked putting my people under someone else's command. You're senior Tactical Officer, but they're my team. I can't help but think that if I'd been there things might have turned out differently. I understand. When we first came aboard Enterprise, we definitely felt like outsiders. My point is, none of us feel that way anymore. We're all part of the same crew, no matter which uniform we wear. Don't worry about Ensign Sato. We'll bring her home. [Captain's Mess] (Porthos is watching his master hoping for scraps. Of course, he gets some.) Ensign. Ensign! Hayes to Enterprise. Enterprise, respond. We should get back to the beam-in point. (He hauls Hoshi over his shoulder easily.) [Trans-dimensional space] Take her. Lock on Kelly and Sato. (They get beamed out.) You two are next. (After Kemper, who has just been hit, and the other are safe.) I could use a change of scenery. I told him I was ready for duty. How's Ensign Sato? All in a days work. Use McKenzie. She knows the team. Rely on her.

Is that what this is all about? You think that I want to replace you?
