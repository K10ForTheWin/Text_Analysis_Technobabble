I am only picking up physical impulses from the three of them.  As far as instruments can make out, there is nothing else down there  that's alive.  They're gone, Mister DeSalle. The captain  and the others simply stopped registering.  I did, sir, as soon as it happened.  I can do it, sir. I'm not that green.  It's up sixty degrees in the past thirty seconds. We're burning  up, sir. [Drawing room] Temperature is almost back to normal,  dropping down fast.  It's some kind of a force field, sir, but  not like any other I've ever heard of before. It's not coming from  anywhere. It's simply all around us. [Drawing room] It will not analyse, sir.  It was that electrical field we set up, Mister DeSalle, that  dent you wanted. It's not much, but it is a start. 
Mister Scott. I'm picking up something on  the sensors, sir. Seems to be another ship.  It's just at the edge of our sensor range, sir. Hard to get an  exact reading.  The ship's disappeared, sir. Gone out of  range.  I have it on the sensors, sir. Tie into my channel, Lieutenant.    Negative, sir. No debris, no residual particles, no traces.  It should be on our screens by now.  Nothing, sir. If it were destroyed, I'd pick up debris readings  of some sort.  Nothing.  I know this saying. It was invented in Russia. (he smirks to  himself) [Cave] (Eleen knocks out the sleeping McCoy and leaves.) [Cave entrance] (Atop the rocks, Kirk and Spock are keeping lookout  for the Capellans when McCoy wakes.)  Mister Scott? Sensors picking up a vessel ahead, cutting across  our path.  It's an alien, sir. By configuration a Klingon warship. Taking  position directly in our path. 
Entering standard orbit around Pollux Four, sir.  Am I seeing things?  And I am the tsar of all the Russias.  I'm sorry, Captain. I never met a god before.  Whatever he is, he seems to control a remarkable technology.  Captain, the phasers. All the working parts are fused.  Aye, aye, sir.  (leaves)  There is a repeated occurrence of  registrations, a regular pulsating pattern of radiated energy.  Sir, some creatures can generate and control energy with no  harm to themselves. The electric eel on Earth, the giant dry worm of  Antos Four, the fluffy  The captain requires complete information.  That would seem most likely, sir.  Are you all right, Captain?  He disappeared again like the cat in that Russian story.  Cheshire? No, sir. Minsk perhaps, but  Sir, there is something I noticed. Apollo looked very strange  when he disappeared, tired or in pain. I don't know if it means  anything.  How?  And Apollo's gone, after attacking you and Mister Scott. You  think maybe he's off somewhere recharging his energy cells?  Perhaps if I assisted.  Twenty two, sir. 
(a bit of a Russian accent) We'll have to head directly there  at warp six, sir. Insufficient time to stop off at Vulcan.  I think I'm going to get space sick. [Kirk's quarters] Mister Sulu, you don't think  Bridge. Navigation. [Sickbay] Course already plotted. Laying it in, sir. [Sickbay]
It makes me homesick. Just like Russia.  Of course, Doctor. The Garden of Eden was just outside Moscow.  A very nice place. It must have made Adam and Eve very sad to leave.  What is it, Mister Spock?  If you insist on worrying, worry about me. I've been wanting to  get you in a place like this for a long time.  I was about to take some readings.  Mind your own business, sir! For your information, I have a  very high efficiency rating.  What do you want, violence?  (Kirk catches their observer, and hits him as he tries to run away. To  his astonishment, the white-haired male begins to cry.)  Now we're welcome. A while ago this whole planet was trying to  kill us. It doesn't make sense.  Any place we can be together is paradise.  I don't know.  Martha, I don't know. But if we do have to stay here, would it  be so very bad?  Get back in there.  Get back in there. Now! 
Co-ordinates seven one two stroke four, Mister Sulu.  Deck five, sir?  (As Kirk leaves the lift, someone punches him in the face and he is  grabbed.)  [Corridor] (holding a phaser on Kirk) So you die,  Captain, and we all move up in rank. No one will question the  assassination of a captain who has disobeyed prime orders of the  Empire.  Captain's log, supplemental. I command an  Enterprise where officers apparently employ private henchmen among the  crew, where assassination of superiors is a common means of advancing  in rank.  [Corridor] (Suddenly, one of Chekov's men turns against him,  taking his weapon and shooting another. Kirk throws his final assailant  and he gets zapped into molecules too. The turbolift opens and two  armed men come out.) 
Captain! Captain! Captain! Captain!  A man, sir. In there. A dead man. [Building] (Again, the lights only come on when the party  reaches the table in the middle of the room.)  Promises. [McCoy's office] Give us some more blood, Chekov. The needle  won't hurt, Chekov. Take off your shirt, Chekov. Roll over, Chekov.  Breathe deeply, Chekov. Blood sample, Chekov. Marrow sample, Chekov.  Skin sample, Chekov. If I live long enough, I'm going to run out of  samples.  Oh, yes. I'll live, but I won't enjoy it.  That's what you said the last time.  Yes.  Commodore Stocker, what are your orders? Commodore!  (But he is transfixed by the sight of another weapon blast heading for  them on the viewscreen.)  [Doctor's office] Sir, the Romulans do not take captives. 
You know this man, Captain?  I think we're in a lot of trouble.  Oh, yes, thank you. (they pour him a cup of wine) You're Alice  And you're Alice  Oh, well, it doesn't make much difference. You're both lovely.  What a shame you're not real.  Oh, I mean real girls.  You are?  Harry Mudd programmed you?  That unprincipled, evil-minded, lecherous kulak Harry Mudd  programmed you?  This place is even better than Leningrad.  [Laboratory] (A device has lights running up it.)  I don't know, sir, but it's a very nice gilded cage.  What's next, Captain?  Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, lovely lady. You dance  divinely.  Yes, Captain. (and goes into an energetic Cossack dance) 
One parsec, sir. Close enough to smell them.  I was making a little joke, sir.  The area was first mapped by the famous Russian astronomer Ivan  Borkoff almost two hundred  Burke, sir? I don't think so. I'm sure it was  Oh, Royal Academy. Well  Under terms of the Organian Peace Treaty, one side or the other  must prove it can develop the planet most efficiently.  I remember once Peter the Great had that problem like that. The    Code One emergency. That's a disaster call.  Main phasers armed and ready, sir.  (The space station is on the main viewer, looking intact.)  But there's nothing there. Just the station.  She wants to shop, and I thought I would help her.  Oh, quadrotriticale. I've read about this, but I've never seen  any before.  Not everyone, Captain. It's a Russian invention.  He won't bite, will he?  Hey! He's eating my grain.  A hundred kilometres off K7. It's just sitting there.  This is vodka.  Scotch?  It was invented by a little old lady from Leningrad.  (Korax goes over to the bar and shares his drink with Jones.)  That Cossack.  You heard what he called the captain.  Mister Scott!  No, sir, I didn't.  I don't know, sir. 
Computed and on the board, sir.  Only one sixteenth parsec away, Captain. We should be there in  seconds.  Coming up on the planet, captain.  (A planet with lots of water, some land masses and just s few wispy  white clouds.)  Definitely class M, somewhat similar to Earth.  That may take some time.  Aye, sir. <Back  to the episode listing Star Trek ® and related  marks are trademarks of CBS Studios Inc.  Copyright © 1966, Present.

A small ship, Captain. It's been there five minutes, remaining  outside phaser range at extreme limit of sensors.  Aye, sir.  [Sarek's quarters] Phasers armed and ready, sir.  (The bright dot on the viewscreen whizzes past them.)  Back on original heading, Captain. The intruder changed course  immediately after we did. It's paralleling us again.  It's the intruder ship, sir.  No change, sir. Maintaining its distance.  Captain, the alien vessel is moving closer.  Captain, the alien ship has changed course and speed. Moving  directly toward us at warp eight.  Aye, sir. Shields on. Phasers manned and ready, sir.  Aye, sir.  (The little light flashes past and the Enterprise rocks.)  Moving away. Turning now. He's coming around again.  A clean miss, sir.  Sensors record standard phasers, sir.  He's coming around again.  (Another hit and jolt.)  [Sickbay] Fire control locked into the computers, Captain.  Aye, sir.  Full spread missed, sir. They're moving too fast for us.  [Sickbay] Number four shield has buckled, sir.  Switching over. Shields firming up. Number four is still weak,  sir. If they hit us there again, it'll go altogether.  (Sickbay gets its power back.)  (Thelev is brought to the Bridge.)  Number two shield is gone.  We're starting to drift, sir. Shall I hold her on course?  Aye, sir. Phasers standing by. He's just hovering out there,  sir.  Here he comes. Range decreasing. Speed dropping close to  sublight.  Phasers locked on target. Range closing. Seventy five thousand  kilometres.  Got him! 
Captain, we're holding the planet between  us and the Klingons. I don't think they've spotted us.  I can try, Captain.  And, sir, the fact Earth took twelve centuries doesn't mean  they had to.  Or machine guns?  They haven't spotted us yet, sir. Looks like they're beaming  someone aboard. 
Standard orbit, Captain.  Captain. what happened?  That was a rough trip.  But Captain, if we're not on Gamma Two,  then where are we?  Mine, too.  Nobody's hurt, Captain. Yet.  Captain, the Enterprise. They will be  trying to find us, won't they?  You, you have been selected for me?  Chekov.  (nervous of her intentions) Oh, pleased, Pleased to know you,  miss.  That's very kind of you, miss, but  Cossacks.  (Galt gives them a reminder of what their collars do.)  This is going to kill our romance.  (They let Uhura out.)  (pointing to an exit) Captain. [Combat area] (Galt appears, and punishment is administered.) ONE 
Nothing, sir. Continuing to scan.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  We've run a full scanner probe twice.  I have a reading on the whatever it is, Captain. Leaving the  planet surface, heading into space.  Magnification twelve. There, sir. Got it.  Open hatch on impulse engine number two. Mister Scott was doing  an AID clean-up on it.  Aye, sir.  The creature is slowing. It's down to warp  two.  I don't understand. It was outrunning us.  Phasers show ready, sir. [Garrovick's quarters] (Garrovick takes the lid off his meal and throws it  across the room. It knocks the switch on his ventilation filter to  'bypass'.)  It's coming to a full halt, sir.  Magnification one.  Within phaser range, sir.  Locked on target.  Phasers ineffectual, sir.  Minimum pattern ready, sir.  Deflectors up, sir.  Five seconds to contact. All hatches and vents secure. All  lights on the board show green. Sir! The number two impulse vent! we  have a red light!  Results positive, Captain. The creature has left the ship at  high warp speed and is already nearly out of scanner range. The way  that thing can move, Captain, I wouldn't believe it.  Computed and on the board.  Ahead full, sir.  One point seven days, sir. 
Captain I have just completed a full long-range scan of Gamma  Seven-A system. It is dead.  It is dead.  [Sickbay] (Spock is on a biobed, being scanned.)  Perhaps an interstellar dust cloud.  Aye, sir. Probe ready. Switching data feed to library computer.    Probe launched, sir.  (A high pitched sound comes over the speakers.)  Penetration of the zone in one minute, seven seconds, sir.  Phasers standing by. Deflectors at full power, sir.  (That eardrum splitting sound comes again.)  Captain, the stars are gone!  (The viewscreen is completely blank.)  Aye, sir. Probe ready for launch, sir.  Probe launched, sir.  Yes, sir. Data being relayed to Mister Spock.  Magnification four, sir.  Sir, Mister Spock has reduced life-support  systems to bare minimum.  According to Spock's telemetry information, there are over  forty chromosomes in the nucleus that are ready to come together, ready  to reproduce.  We're through, sir.  Aye, sir.  Target co-ordinates programmed, sir. Probe ready for launch.  Programming complete. Ready for launch.  Probe launched, sir.  (There's a little jolt.)  Probe confirmed. It is lodged in the nucleus, near the  chromosome bodies.  Estimate we'll be out in six point thirty seven minutes.  Captain, metallic substance outside the ship.  Fifty seven seconds, sir.  The organism is destroyed, sir. The explosion must have  ruptured the membrane and thrown us clear. 
Approaching Sigma Iotia Two, Captain. 
Something penetrating from the planet.  It's dead, sir. All major power disabled.  We've jumped to warp eight.  We made it. 
Aye, sir.  Spacecraft approaching from inner planet.  Phasers ready.  Two thousand kilometres, closing fast.  Orbit computed and locked in, sir. 
Approaching Alpha Carinae Two. ETA five minutes.  Captain, the M-5 unit has already identified the vessels as  Federation starships Excalibur and Lexington.  Enemy vessel closing with us.  Changing course to two eight mark four two.  (Pavel feels as fed up and useless as Kirk as the machine does his job  for him.)  Turning to one one three mark five. Warp four speed.  Moving back to original course and speed.  Speed increasing to warp three, Captain.  Going to warp four, sir.  Returning to original course and speed.  I've been updating that course for hours.  (But they flip switches in vain.) [Corridor] Sir, G nine five system appears dead. [Corridor] Sir, deflector shield just came on. Speed increasing to warp  four.  Turning now, sir.  Closing on the Lexington again, sir. The Hood and Potemkin are  moving off.  Excalibur is maneuvering away, sir. We're increasing speed to  follow.  Coming to new course, sir. Bearing on the Potemkin.  Captain, the ships are coming within range again.  Sir, deflector shields have dropped. 
Sensor shows that the rocket has armed itself, Mister Scott.  We've still time to enter close orbit and destroy it with our  phaser, sir. 
Range, forty five thousand kilometres, Captain.  Range, forty three thousand kilometres and closing.  Thirty eight thousand and closing. Thirty five thousand and  closing.  Aye, aye, sir.  (The object swings back into the centre of the viewscreen.)  Aye, sir.  It was Russian, sir. Every word.  Aye, sir. Standard orbit in five minutes.  (The buoy does not obstruct them.)  Then what are we doing here?  Where are we now, Captain?  (The sheriff's office is just the front of the building, no sides, back  or roof.)  Who won?  And we are the Clantons?  Oh, you knew that?  And pass up an opportunity to see you? Don't be silly.  Get your hands off her.  What can I do, Captain? You know we're always supposed to  maintain good relations with the natives. (he kisses her)  I don't think that's such a bad thing, Captain.  With his outdated weapon? If he shoots at me, I will just step  out of the way.  A lot of people and things have tried to kill me. You'd be  surprised.  Yes, sir.  Where are we going, Captain?  Yes, but where is the Enterprise?  I'd be using the ship's sensors trying to locate us.  All those western Cossacks had were poisonous snakes and cactus  plants.  Sylvia! Hello.  That's very nice.  That's just what I was preparing to inquire. Have you been  shopping?  No, no, I haven't forgotten. I am looking forward to it most  eagerly.  Married? I'm afraid that wouldn't be possible.  But it is absolutely impossible. I am not someone you can  marry. If only I could make clear to you what I really am.  Mister Earp. Get your hands off her.  (Chekov walks towards Morgan, and gets shot. Kirk and Spock hear  Sylvia's scream and arrive on the scene the same time as McCoy,  followed by Scott. Wyatt and Holliday also turn up.)  Captain, I don't understand.  What happened? Where have I been?  But that girl. She was so beautiful. So real.  No.  It's, it's gone, sir.  Warp factor two, sir. 
Course computed, sir.  Photon torpedoes ready.  Aye, Captain.  (Scott and Spock enter)  Aye, sir.  (Six torpedoes go, but not all hit the Klingons)  He's badly damaged, Captain. Continuing away at reduced speed. 
Deflection point minus seven. [Engineering] Deflection point minus four.  Power dropping, sir.  (The lights dim.)  Zero. Deflection point now, sir.  Power dropping, sir.  That heading will put us directly in the asteroid's path, sir.  Tau eight point seven. Beta point zero four one.  Almost dead centre, sir. 
I have completed the assignment, Captain. A  theoretical incursion into  You're alive!  Captain, your ears. What happened?  Aye, sir.  Romulans and Vulcans appear to read almost exactly alike. There  is just a slight difference which. Got him, sir.  Sir, transporter room has the co-ordinates and is ready for  beaming.  Entering Neutral Zone, Captain. 
Yes, we will. All the time we're here.  I have been instructed to place you and Mister Spock under  arrest.  Starfleet Command, sir.  I'm sorry, but I must insist you and Mister Spock come with me  to the detention section.  (drawing his phaser) Do not force me to kill you, sir. I will  if I have to. Will you come peacefully, Captain?  I have never disobeyed an order, Captain. You know I have never    I will not disobey now! I cannot disobey! 
Range forty three thousand and closing.  Aye, sir. Thirty eight thousand and closing.  System Sigma Draconis.  Nothing, sir.  Aye, Captain.  Sun, spectral type, Gamma nine. Nine planets, three of them,  Class M possessing sapient life according to reports and long-range  scanning.  The one on the left, number three, rates letter B on the  industrial scale.  Yes, sir. Second planet Class M, number four, rates letter G.  Number six. No sign of industrial development. At last report,  in a Glacial Age. Sapient life plentiful, but on a most primitive  level.  Yes, sir.  No, sir.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  No sign of organised civilisation. Primitive humanoids picked  up at irregular intervals.  I can't explain it, sir.  Sigma Draconis Three. It's closest, heaviest population.  None of these planets could.  Several thousand years at least. Only the tropical zone is  ice-free.  What if you guess wrong, Captain?  No structures, Captain. No mechanised objects that I can read.  No surface consumption or generation of energy. Atmosphere is perfectly  all right, of course. Temperature, a high maximum of forty. Livable.  Captain, five hundred metres in that direction there's a  foundation under the surface. A huge one. Registrations all over the  place.  Yes, sir. Immensely old, completely buried. But they were here  once.  What could the Others do to cause such terror?  A peculiar mixture.  And the male humanoid who doesn't know the meaning of the word  female.  If it will trap the creatures for the Others, Captain, won't it  trap us, too?  Aye, sir.  (McCoy and Spock beam down. Spock is in a brown overall, and has a  device on his head. McCoy is holding a remote control unit with  coloured buttons. He presses one and Spock turns left to face us.)  It might be a long wait. We may as well be  comfortable.  (He uses his phaser to heat a rock, and they warm their hands in its  glow.)  [Cave]
And accelerating.  A madman got us into this, and it's beginning to look as if  only a madman can get us out.  Our position? Our position is so close to the point where we  entered the void, the difference isn't worth mentioning. Bull's-eye,  Mister Spock.  The new headings will be plotted in a minute, sir. 
Captain. Visual detection of an object dead ahead.  Has there ever been a mutiny on a starship before?  Captain.  Just like what I found in life support. All dead. [Defiant Bridge] It's gone. The Defiant just vanished.  (Scott and O'Neil start fiddling with the innards of the transporter  console.)  I don't understand what's so special about this region of  space.  And die like him?  (Chekov leaps up, pushes Spock away and, screaming, attacks Sulu. Scott  grabs him and McCoy arrives to help. Spock grabs his face.)  Thank you, Mister Spock.  Two minutes, sir.  Yes, sir. The ship can drive into interspace at any time.  Interphase in ten seconds. Nine, eight [Transporter room] (Chapel and McCoy enter.)  One.  There he is!  We're being pulled out of here.  Captain, we have destroyed the Tholians' web.  At once, sir.  The ship has been thrown exactly two point seven two parsecs  distant from our previous position.  Mister Spock, it's him! It's the Captain! 
Aye, Captain.  Aye, sir.  Aye, sir.  Course of asteroid, I mean spaceship two four one mark one  seven. 
Full scan. Results negative. Radiation level normal. Atmosphere  and terrain are undisturbed. No evidence of a colony nor any residual  aftereffect of a force that might have annihilated it.  Which we were unable to detect upon approach.  Cossacks! Filthy Klingon murderers! You killed my brother  Piotre. The Archanis Four research outpost. A hundred peaceful people  massacred! Just like you did here. My brother, you killed my brother.  Captain, you can't. Don't let these animals have the ship.  Captain, leave them where they are. Non-existence. That's so  many less Klingon monsters in the galaxy.  (Two more security guards arrive.)  We know what happened. That distress call.  Lies. They want to start a war by  pretending that we did.  Captain. (he has a sword too)  Captain! (gets up to go with Sulu)  Sir, let me go too. I've got a personal score to settle with  the Klingons.  Captain!  Don't try to stop me, Captain. I saw what they left of Piotre,  and I swore on his grave I would avenge his murder.  (Chekov dashes into the turbolift.)  You don't die yet. You're not human, but you're very beautiful.  Very beautiful.  (He rips her top, covers her mouth and I'll leave his intentions to  your imaginations. Kirk comes along in the nick of time.) 
At present speed, our eta is three hours, four minutes, sir.  I think that may be a Starfleet shuttlecraft.  I verify, sir, it's out there.  No malfunction, sir. The reading persists.  It's headed straight for us!  It shifts with us, sir. And we're pushing to the limit!  We're on collision course.  We're moving at warp eight.  four oh three mark seven. Straight for the Coal Sack if there  is no letup.  Four oh three mark seven.  After all, we are only human.  There was persecution on Earth once. I remember reading about  it in my history class.  Ready, sir.  Tanks positioned.  Ready, sir.  I don't rightly know, Mister Spock. I was trying to programme  for Starbase Four as ordered. I can't get a response.  We are not killers.  Locking onto co-ordinates. 
Co-ordinates confirmed.  We should never have agreed to such restrictions.  Are there any other possibilities? 
I didn't think Mister Scott would go for  the brainy type.  Captain. It was not hands that were paralysed. It was eyes. I  could not force my eyes to look down and set a new course.  I cannot, sir. It has the ability to change speed.  Completing approach to planetoid.  Making final approach.  Captain, we are within orbit range.  Aye, sir.  Present course is one two six mark twenty.  One four three mark three. 
Aye, aye, sir.  If it continues on course, it will enter Romulan space.  Not yet, sir.  Irina?  (The hippies are seated on the floor of the transporter room)  Captain.  Sir, I believe I know one of them. At least, I think I  recognise her voice. Her name is Irina Galliulin. We were in Starfleet  Academy together.  Yes, sir. She dropped out. She  Thank you, sir.  (Spock enters)  Excuse me. Is Irina Galliulin with you?  Irina.  You knew I was on the Enterprise?  Irina, why? Come. [Corridor] How could you do this to yourself? You were  a scientist. And now, look at you.  Why did you do it?  I am proud of what I am. I believe in what I do. Can you say  that?  Yes.  You even talk like them. Why did you go away?  I came back to look for you. I looked. Where did you go?  You never felt as I did. Never.  You don't have it in you to feel so much. Even when we were  close, you weren't with me. You were off thinking of something else.  Why did you stay away?  Go to your friends.  (Irina leaves, and there is a commotion in the corridor.)  [Corridor] Yes.  Auxiliary control.  Should the main control room breakdown or suffer damage, we can  navigate the ship from here. What do you want?  It does not matter.  Let us not discuss your beliefs.  Then why do you do such things?  I am assisting Mister Spock in locating your Eden.  I am not. These tapes contain star charts, and we project the  orbits of the various planets here. By mathematical process, we  determine whether or not they are affected by other bodies not yet  charted.  What I do not know I find out from the computer banks. If, if I  knew nothing at all, I could navigate the ship simply by studying what  is stored in there. They contain the sum of all human knowledge. They  solve our problems of navigation. Of control. Of life support.  No. We use our own judgment also.  You could never listen to anyone. You always had to be  different.  I am sorry, Mister Spock. I was momentarily delayed. [Guest quarters] Eden.  The flower, sir. I touched it. It's like fire.  (His palm is covered in blisters)  Captain, I wish first to apologise for my conduct during this  time. I did not maintain myself under proper discipline. I endangered  the ship and its personnel by my conduct. I respectfully submit myself  for disciplinary action.  Thank you, sir.  (Irina enters)  I was coming to say goodbye.  And you be correct. 
He called it to the second, sir. We'll be over it in exactly  twelve minutes now.  As life-forms. They are living beings.  The readings are those of humanoids.  The deterioration in the shielding has stopped and is reversing  itself. I have no explanation. 
One two seven mark eight.  Direct course to Benecia, three seven three mark eight.  Forty-eight hours, sir.  Seventy two hours, Captain.  Starfleet expressly forbids the death penalty.  General Order Four. It has not been violated by any officer on  the Enterprise.  Captain Kirk wouldn't order an execution even if he were going  mad. That cannot be the captain.  If security backs him up, how will we fight him?  Coming within scanning range. 
I am only picking up physical impulses from the three of them.  As far as instruments can make out, there is nothing else down there  that's alive.  They're gone, Mister DeSalle. The captain  and the others simply stopped registering.  I did, sir, as soon as it happened.  I can do it, sir. I'm not that green.  It's up sixty degrees in the past thirty seconds. We're burning  up, sir. [Drawing room] Temperature is almost back to normal,  dropping down fast.  It's some kind of a force field, sir, but  not like any other I've ever heard of before. It's not coming from  anywhere. It's simply all around us. [Drawing room] It will not analyse, sir.  It was that electrical field we set up, Mister DeSalle, that  dent you wanted. It's not much, but it is a start. 
Mister Scott. I'm picking up something on  the sensors, sir. Seems to be another ship.  It's just at the edge of our sensor range, sir. Hard to get an  exact reading.  The ship's disappeared, sir. Gone out of  range.  I have it on the sensors, sir. Tie into my channel, Lieutenant.    Negative, sir. No debris, no residual particles, no traces.  It should be on our screens by now.  Nothing, sir. If it were destroyed, I'd pick up debris readings  of some sort.  Nothing.  I know this saying. It was invented in Russia. (he smirks to  himself) [Cave] (Eleen knocks out the sleeping McCoy and leaves.) [Cave entrance] (Atop the rocks, Kirk and Spock are keeping lookout  for the Capellans when McCoy wakes.)  Mister Scott? Sensors picking up a vessel ahead, cutting across  our path.  It's an alien, sir. By configuration a Klingon warship. Taking  position directly in our path. 
Entering standard orbit around Pollux Four, sir.  Am I seeing things?  And I am the tsar of all the Russias.  I'm sorry, Captain. I never met a god before.  Whatever he is, he seems to control a remarkable technology.  Captain, the phasers. All the working parts are fused.  Aye, aye, sir.  (leaves)  There is a repeated occurrence of  registrations, a regular pulsating pattern of radiated energy.  Sir, some creatures can generate and control energy with no  harm to themselves. The electric eel on Earth, the giant dry worm of  Antos Four, the fluffy  The captain requires complete information.  That would seem most likely, sir.  Are you all right, Captain?  He disappeared again like the cat in that Russian story.  Cheshire? No, sir. Minsk perhaps, but  Sir, there is something I noticed. Apollo looked very strange  when he disappeared, tired or in pain. I don't know if it means  anything.  How?  And Apollo's gone, after attacking you and Mister Scott. You  think maybe he's off somewhere recharging his energy cells?  Perhaps if I assisted.  Twenty two, sir. 
(a bit of a Russian accent) We'll have to head directly there  at warp six, sir. Insufficient time to stop off at Vulcan.  Navigation. Chekov here.  I don't understand, Captain.  We're on course for Vulcan, Captain, as Mister  Spock ordered.  I think I'm going to get space sick. [Kirk's quarters] Mister Sulu, you don't think  Bridge. Navigation. [Sickbay] Course already plotted. Laying it in, sir. [Sickbay]
It makes me homesick. Just like Russia.  Of course, Doctor. The Garden of Eden was just outside Moscow.  A very nice place. It must have made Adam and Eve very sad to leave.  What is it, Mister Spock?  If you insist on worrying, worry about me. I've been wanting to  get you in a place like this for a long time.  I was about to take some readings.  Mind your own business, sir! For your information, I have a  very high efficiency rating.  What do you want, violence?  (Kirk catches their observer, and hits him as he tries to run away. To  his astonishment, the white-haired male begins to cry.)  Now we're welcome. A while ago this whole planet was trying to  kill us. It doesn't make sense.  Any place we can be together is paradise.  I don't know.  Martha, I don't know. But if we do have to stay here, would it  be so very bad?  Get back in there.  Get back in there. Now! 
Co-ordinates seven one two stroke four, Mister Sulu.  Deck five, sir?  (As Kirk leaves the lift, someone punches him in the face and he is  grabbed.)  [Corridor] (holding a phaser on Kirk) So you die,  Captain, and we all move up in rank. No one will question the  assassination of a captain who has disobeyed prime orders of the  Empire.  Captain's log, supplemental. I command an  Enterprise where officers apparently employ private henchmen among the  crew, where assassination of superiors is a common means of advancing  in rank.  [Corridor] (Suddenly, one of Chekov's men turns against him,  taking his weapon and shooting another. Kirk throws his final assailant  and he gets zapped into molecules too. The turbolift opens and two  armed men come out.) 
Captain! Captain! Captain! Captain!  A man, sir. In there. A dead man. [Building] (Again, the lights only come on when the party  reaches the table in the middle of the room.)  Promises. [McCoy's office] Give us some more blood, Chekov. The needle  won't hurt, Chekov. Take off your shirt, Chekov. Roll over, Chekov.  Breathe deeply, Chekov. Blood sample, Chekov. Marrow sample, Chekov.  Skin sample, Chekov. If I live long enough, I'm going to run out of  samples.  Oh, yes. I'll live, but I won't enjoy it.  That's what you said the last time.  Yes.  Commodore Stocker, what are your orders? Commodore!  (But he is transfixed by the sight of another weapon blast heading for  them on the viewscreen.)  [Doctor's office] Sir, the Romulans do not take captives. 
You know this man, Captain?  I think we're in a lot of trouble.  Oh, yes, thank you. (they pour him a cup of wine) You're Alice  And you're Alice  Oh, well, it doesn't make much difference. You're both lovely.  What a shame you're not real.  Oh, I mean real girls.  You are?  Harry Mudd programmed you?  That unprincipled, evil-minded, lecherous kulak Harry Mudd  programmed you?  This place is even better than Leningrad.  [Laboratory] (A device has lights running up it.)  I don't know, sir, but it's a very nice gilded cage.  What's next, Captain?  Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, lovely lady. You dance  divinely.  Yes, Captain. (and goes into an energetic Cossack dance) 
One parsec, sir. Close enough to smell them.  I was making a little joke, sir.  The area was first mapped by the famous Russian astronomer Ivan  Borkoff almost two hundred  Burke, sir? I don't think so. I'm sure it was  Oh, Royal Academy. Well  Under terms of the Organian Peace Treaty, one side or the other  must prove it can develop the planet most efficiently.  I remember once Peter the Great had that problem like that. The    Code One emergency. That's a disaster call.  Main phasers armed and ready, sir.  (The space station is on the main viewer, looking intact.)  But there's nothing there. Just the station.  She wants to shop, and I thought I would help her.  Oh, quadrotriticale. I've read about this, but I've never seen  any before.  Not everyone, Captain. It's a Russian invention.  He won't bite, will he?  Hey! He's eating my grain.  A hundred kilometres off K7. It's just sitting there.  This is vodka.  Scotch?  It was invented by a little old lady from Leningrad.  (Korax goes over to the bar and shares his drink with Jones.)  That Cossack.  You heard what he called the captain.  Mister Scott!  No, sir, I didn't.  I don't know, sir. 
Computed and on the board, sir.  Only one sixteenth parsec away, Captain. We should be there in  seconds.  Coming up on the planet, captain.  (A planet with lots of water, some land masses and just s few wispy  white clouds.)  Definitely class M, somewhat similar to Earth.  That may take some time.  Aye, sir. <Back  to the episode listing Star Trek ® and related  marks are trademarks of CBS Studios Inc.  Copyright © 1966, Present.

A small ship, Captain. It's been there five minutes, remaining  outside phaser range at extreme limit of sensors.  Aye, sir.  [Sarek's quarters] Phasers armed and ready, sir.  (The bright dot on the viewscreen whizzes past them.)  Back on original heading, Captain. The intruder changed course  immediately after we did. It's paralleling us again.  It's the intruder ship, sir.  No change, sir. Maintaining its distance.  Captain, the alien vessel is moving closer.  Captain, the alien ship has changed course and speed. Moving  directly toward us at warp eight.  Aye, sir. Shields on. Phasers manned and ready, sir.  Aye, sir.  (The little light flashes past and the Enterprise rocks.)  Moving away. Turning now. He's coming around again.  A clean miss, sir.  Sensors record standard phasers, sir.  He's coming around again.  (Another hit and jolt.)  [Sickbay] Fire control locked into the computers, Captain.  Aye, sir.  Full spread missed, sir. They're moving too fast for us.  [Sickbay] Number four shield has buckled, sir.  Switching over. Shields firming up. Number four is still weak,  sir. If they hit us there again, it'll go altogether.  (Sickbay gets its power back.)  (Thelev is brought to the Bridge.)  Number two shield is gone.  We're starting to drift, sir. Shall I hold her on course?  Aye, sir. Phasers standing by. He's just hovering out there,  sir.  Here he comes. Range decreasing. Speed dropping close to  sublight.  Phasers locked on target. Range closing. Seventy five thousand  kilometres.  Got him! 
Captain, we're holding the planet between  us and the Klingons. I don't think they've spotted us.  I can try, Captain.  And, sir, the fact Earth took twelve centuries doesn't mean  they had to.  Or machine guns?  They haven't spotted us yet, sir. Looks like they're beaming  someone aboard. 
Standard orbit, Captain.  Captain. what happened?  That was a rough trip.  But Captain, if we're not on Gamma Two,  then where are we?  Mine, too.  Nobody's hurt, Captain. Yet.  Captain, the Enterprise. They will be  trying to find us, won't they?  You, you have been selected for me?  Chekov.  (nervous of her intentions) Oh, pleased, Pleased to know you,  miss.  That's very kind of you, miss, but  Cossacks.  (Galt gives them a reminder of what their collars do.)  This is going to kill our romance.  (They let Uhura out.)  (pointing to an exit) Captain. [Combat area] (Galt appears, and punishment is administered.) ONE 
Nothing, sir. Continuing to scan.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  We've run a full scanner probe twice.  I have a reading on the whatever it is, Captain. Leaving the  planet surface, heading into space.  Magnification twelve. There, sir. Got it.  Open hatch on impulse engine number two. Mister Scott was doing  an AID clean-up on it.  Aye, sir.  The creature is slowing. It's down to warp  two.  I don't understand. It was outrunning us.  Phasers show ready, sir. [Garrovick's quarters] (Garrovick takes the lid off his meal and throws it  across the room. It knocks the switch on his ventilation filter to  'bypass'.)  It's coming to a full halt, sir.  Magnification one.  Within phaser range, sir.  Locked on target.  Phasers ineffectual, sir.  Minimum pattern ready, sir.  Deflectors up, sir.  Five seconds to contact. All hatches and vents secure. All  lights on the board show green. Sir! The number two impulse vent! we  have a red light!  Results positive, Captain. The creature has left the ship at  high warp speed and is already nearly out of scanner range. The way  that thing can move, Captain, I wouldn't believe it.  Computed and on the board.  Ahead full, sir.  One point seven days, sir. 
Captain I have just completed a full long-range scan of Gamma  Seven-A system. It is dead.  It is dead.  [Sickbay] (Spock is on a biobed, being scanned.)  Perhaps an interstellar dust cloud.  Aye, sir. Probe ready. Switching data feed to library computer.    Probe launched, sir.  (A high pitched sound comes over the speakers.)  Penetration of the zone in one minute, seven seconds, sir.  Phasers standing by. Deflectors at full power, sir.  (That eardrum splitting sound comes again.)  Captain, the stars are gone!  (The viewscreen is completely blank.)  Aye, sir. Probe ready for launch, sir.  Probe launched, sir.  Yes, sir. Data being relayed to Mister Spock.  Magnification four, sir.  Sir, Mister Spock has reduced life-support  systems to bare minimum.  According to Spock's telemetry information, there are over  forty chromosomes in the nucleus that are ready to come together, ready  to reproduce.  We're through, sir.  Aye, sir.  Target co-ordinates programmed, sir. Probe ready for launch.  Programming complete. Ready for launch.  Probe launched, sir.  (There's a little jolt.)  Probe confirmed. It is lodged in the nucleus, near the  chromosome bodies.  Estimate we'll be out in six point thirty seven minutes.  Captain, metallic substance outside the ship.  Fifty seven seconds, sir.  The organism is destroyed, sir. The explosion must have  ruptured the membrane and thrown us clear. 
Approaching Sigma Iotia Two, Captain. 
Something penetrating from the planet.  It's dead, sir. All major power disabled.  We've jumped to warp eight.  We made it. 
Aye, sir.  Spacecraft approaching from inner planet.  Phasers ready.  Two thousand kilometres, closing fast.  Orbit computed and locked in, sir. 
Approaching Alpha Carinae Two. ETA five minutes.  Captain, the M-5 unit has already identified the vessels as  Federation starships Excalibur and Lexington.  Enemy vessel closing with us.  Changing course to two eight mark four two.  (Pavel feels as fed up and useless as Kirk as the machine does his job  for him.)  Turning to one one three mark five. Warp four speed.  Moving back to original course and speed.  Speed increasing to warp three, Captain.  Going to warp four, sir.  Returning to original course and speed.  I've been updating that course for hours.  (But they flip switches in vain.) [Corridor] Sir, G nine five system appears dead. [Corridor] Sir, deflector shield just came on. Speed increasing to warp  four.  Turning now, sir.  Closing on the Lexington again, sir. The Hood and Potemkin are  moving off.  Excalibur is maneuvering away, sir. We're increasing speed to  follow.  Coming to new course, sir. Bearing on the Potemkin.  Captain, the ships are coming within range again.  Sir, deflector shields have dropped. 
We have analysed the direction of his beam, sir.  Our star maps show no habitable planets in that area of the galaxy.  Sensor shows that the rocket has armed itself, Mister Scott.  We've still time to enter close orbit and destroy it with our  phaser, sir. 
Range, forty five thousand kilometres, Captain.  Range, forty three thousand kilometres and closing.  Thirty eight thousand and closing. Thirty five thousand and  closing.  Aye, aye, sir.  (The object swings back into the centre of the viewscreen.)  Aye, sir.  It was Russian, sir. Every word.  Aye, sir. Standard orbit in five minutes.  (The buoy does not obstruct them.)  Then what are we doing here?  Where are we now, Captain?  (The sheriff's office is just the front of the building, no sides, back  or roof.)  Who won?  And we are the Clantons?  Oh, you knew that?  And pass up an opportunity to see you? Don't be silly.  Get your hands off her.  What can I do, Captain? You know we're always supposed to  maintain good relations with the natives. (he kisses her)  I don't think that's such a bad thing, Captain.  With his outdated weapon? If he shoots at me, I will just step  out of the way.  A lot of people and things have tried to kill me. You'd be  surprised.  Yes, sir.  Where are we going, Captain?  Yes, but where is the Enterprise?  I'd be using the ship's sensors trying to locate us.  All those western Cossacks had were poisonous snakes and cactus  plants.  Sylvia! Hello.  That's very nice.  That's just what I was preparing to inquire. Have you been  shopping?  No, no, I haven't forgotten. I am looking forward to it most  eagerly.  Married? I'm afraid that wouldn't be possible.  But it is absolutely impossible. I am not someone you can  marry. If only I could make clear to you what I really am.  Mister Earp. Get your hands off her.  (Chekov walks towards Morgan, and gets shot. Kirk and Spock hear  Sylvia's scream and arrive on the scene the same time as McCoy,  followed by Scott. Wyatt and Holliday also turn up.)  Captain, I don't understand.  What happened? Where have I been?  But that girl. She was so beautiful. So real.  No.  It's, it's gone, sir.  Warp factor two, sir. 
Course computed, sir.  Photon torpedoes ready.  Aye, Captain.  (Scott and Spock enter)  Aye, sir.  (Six torpedoes go, but not all hit the Klingons)  He's badly damaged, Captain. Continuing away at reduced speed. 
Deflection point minus seven. [Engineering] Deflection point minus four.  Power dropping, sir.  (The lights dim.)  Zero. Deflection point now, sir.  Power dropping, sir.  That heading will put us directly in the asteroid's path, sir.  Tau eight point seven. Beta point zero four one.  Almost dead centre, sir. 
I have completed the assignment, Captain. A  theoretical incursion into  You're alive!  Captain, your ears. What happened?  Aye, sir.  Romulans and Vulcans appear to read almost exactly alike. There  is just a slight difference which. Got him, sir.  Sir, transporter room has the co-ordinates and is ready for  beaming.  Entering Neutral Zone, Captain. 
Yes, we will. All the time we're here.  I have been instructed to place you and Mister Spock under  arrest.  Starfleet Command, sir.  I'm sorry, but I must insist you and Mister Spock come with me  to the detention section.  (drawing his phaser) Do not force me to kill you, sir. I will  if I have to. Will you come peacefully, Captain?  I have never disobeyed an order, Captain. You know I have never    I will not disobey now! I cannot disobey! 
Range forty three thousand and closing.  Aye, sir. Thirty eight thousand and closing.  System Sigma Draconis.  Nothing, sir.  Aye, Captain.  Sun, spectral type, Gamma nine. Nine planets, three of them,  Class M possessing sapient life according to reports and long-range  scanning.  The one on the left, number three, rates letter B on the  industrial scale.  Yes, sir. Second planet Class M, number four, rates letter G.  Number six. No sign of industrial development. At last report,  in a Glacial Age. Sapient life plentiful, but on a most primitive  level.  Yes, sir.  No, sir.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  No sign of organised civilisation. Primitive humanoids picked  up at irregular intervals.  I can't explain it, sir.  Sigma Draconis Three. It's closest, heaviest population.  None of these planets could.  Several thousand years at least. Only the tropical zone is  ice-free.  What if you guess wrong, Captain?  No structures, Captain. No mechanised objects that I can read.  No surface consumption or generation of energy. Atmosphere is perfectly  all right, of course. Temperature, a high maximum of forty. Livable.  Captain, five hundred metres in that direction there's a  foundation under the surface. A huge one. Registrations all over the  place.  Yes, sir. Immensely old, completely buried. But they were here  once.  What could the Others do to cause such terror?  A peculiar mixture.  And the male humanoid who doesn't know the meaning of the word  female.  If it will trap the creatures for the Others, Captain, won't it  trap us, too?  Aye, sir.  (McCoy and Spock beam down. Spock is in a brown overall, and has a  device on his head. McCoy is holding a remote control unit with  coloured buttons. He presses one and Spock turns left to face us.)  It might be a long wait. We may as well be  comfortable.  (He uses his phaser to heat a rock, and they warm their hands in its  glow.)  [Cave]
And accelerating.  A madman got us into this, and it's beginning to look as if  only a madman can get us out.  Our position? Our position is so close to the point where we  entered the void, the difference isn't worth mentioning. Bull's-eye,  Mister Spock.  The new headings will be plotted in a minute, sir. 
Captain. Visual detection of an object dead ahead.  Has there ever been a mutiny on a starship before?  Captain.  Just like what I found in life support. All dead. [Defiant Bridge] It's gone. The Defiant just vanished.  (Scott and O'Neil start fiddling with the innards of the transporter  console.)  I don't understand what's so special about this region of  space.  And die like him?  (Chekov leaps up, pushes Spock away and, screaming, attacks Sulu. Scott  grabs him and McCoy arrives to help. Spock grabs his face.)  Thank you, Mister Spock.  Two minutes, sir.  Yes, sir. The ship can drive into interspace at any time.  Interphase in ten seconds. Nine, eight [Transporter room] (Chapel and McCoy enter.)  One.  There he is!  We're being pulled out of here.  Captain, we have destroyed the Tholians' web.  At once, sir.  The ship has been thrown exactly two point seven two parsecs  distant from our previous position.  Mister Spock, it's him! It's the Captain! 
Aye, Captain.  Aye, sir.  Aye, sir.  Course of asteroid, I mean spaceship two four one mark one  seven. 
Full scan. Results negative. Radiation level normal. Atmosphere  and terrain are undisturbed. No evidence of a colony nor any residual  aftereffect of a force that might have annihilated it.  Which we were unable to detect upon approach.  Cossacks! Filthy Klingon murderers! You killed my brother  Piotre. The Archanis Four research outpost. A hundred peaceful people  massacred! Just like you did here. My brother, you killed my brother.  Captain, you can't. Don't let these animals have the ship.  Captain, leave them where they are. Non-existence. That's so  many less Klingon monsters in the galaxy.  (Two more security guards arrive.)  We know what happened. That distress call.  Lies. They want to start a war by  pretending that we did.  Captain. (he has a sword too)  Captain! (gets up to go with Sulu)  Sir, let me go too. I've got a personal score to settle with  the Klingons.  Captain!  Don't try to stop me, Captain. I saw what they left of Piotre,  and I swore on his grave I would avenge his murder.  (Chekov dashes into the turbolift.)  You don't die yet. You're not human, but you're very beautiful.  Very beautiful.  (He rips her top, covers her mouth and I'll leave his intentions to  your imaginations. Kirk comes along in the nick of time.) 
At present speed, our eta is three hours, four minutes, sir.  I think that may be a Starfleet shuttlecraft.  I verify, sir, it's out there.  No malfunction, sir. The reading persists.  It's headed straight for us!  It shifts with us, sir. And we're pushing to the limit!  We're on collision course.  We're moving at warp eight.  four oh three mark seven. Straight for the Coal Sack if there  is no letup.  Four oh three mark seven.  After all, we are only human.  There was persecution on Earth once. I remember reading about  it in my history class.  Ready, sir.  Tanks positioned.  Ready, sir.  I don't rightly know, Mister Spock. I was trying to programme  for Starbase Four as ordered. I can't get a response.  We are not killers.  Locking onto co-ordinates. 
Co-ordinates confirmed.  We should never have agreed to such restrictions.  Are there any other possibilities? 
I didn't think Mister Scott would go for  the brainy type.  Captain. It was not hands that were paralysed. It was eyes. I  could not force my eyes to look down and set a new course.  I cannot, sir. It has the ability to change speed.  Completing approach to planetoid.  Making final approach.  Captain, we are within orbit range.  Aye, sir.  Present course is one two six mark twenty.  One four three mark three. 
Aye, aye, sir.  If it continues on course, it will enter Romulan space.  Not yet, sir.  Irina?  (The hippies are seated on the floor of the transporter room)  Captain.  Sir, I believe I know one of them. At least, I think I  recognise her voice. Her name is Irina Galliulin. We were in Starfleet  Academy together.  Yes, sir. She dropped out. She  Thank you, sir.  (Spock enters)  Excuse me. Is Irina Galliulin with you?  Irina.  You knew I was on the Enterprise?  Irina, why? Come. [Corridor] How could you do this to yourself? You were  a scientist. And now, look at you.  Why did you do it?  I am proud of what I am. I believe in what I do. Can you say  that?  Yes.  You even talk like them. Why did you go away?  I came back to look for you. I looked. Where did you go?  You never felt as I did. Never.  You don't have it in you to feel so much. Even when we were  close, you weren't with me. You were off thinking of something else.  Why did you stay away?  Go to your friends.  (Irina leaves, and there is a commotion in the corridor.)  [Corridor] Yes.  Auxiliary control.  Should the main control room breakdown or suffer damage, we can  navigate the ship from here. What do you want?  It does not matter.  Let us not discuss your beliefs.  Then why do you do such things?  I am assisting Mister Spock in locating your Eden.  I am not. These tapes contain star charts, and we project the  orbits of the various planets here. By mathematical process, we  determine whether or not they are affected by other bodies not yet  charted.  What I do not know I find out from the computer banks. If, if I  knew nothing at all, I could navigate the ship simply by studying what  is stored in there. They contain the sum of all human knowledge. They  solve our problems of navigation. Of control. Of life support.  No. We use our own judgment also.  You could never listen to anyone. You always had to be  different.  I am sorry, Mister Spock. I was momentarily delayed. [Guest quarters] Eden.  The flower, sir. I touched it. It's like fire.  (His palm is covered in blisters)  Captain, I wish first to apologise for my conduct during this  time. I did not maintain myself under proper discipline. I endangered  the ship and its personnel by my conduct. I respectfully submit myself  for disciplinary action.  Thank you, sir.  (Irina enters)  I was coming to say goodbye.  And you be correct. 
He called it to the second, sir. We'll be over it in exactly  twelve minutes now.  As life-forms. They are living beings.  The readings are those of humanoids.  The deterioration in the shielding has stopped and is reversing  itself. I have no explanation. 
One two seven mark eight.  Direct course to Benecia, three seven three mark eight.  Forty-eight hours, sir.  Seventy two hours, Captain.  Starfleet expressly forbids the death penalty.  General Order Four. It has not been violated by any officer on  the Enterprise.  Captain Kirk wouldn't order an execution even if he were going  mad. That cannot be the captain.  If security backs him up, how will we fight him?  Coming within scanning range.
