You're in my way. He addressed me in a disrespectful tone. I expect you will. (The Jem'Hadar leaves.) There she is. Halt. Put down your weapons. What plan is that? There's nothing wrong with me. Leave me alone. (Odo enters) Something's wrong with me. I feel sick when I eat. I have pains in my head, in my chest. I don't want any more tests. You may run your tests. I don't have a name. If you wish. I want to fight. No. The others. I don't know. But that's what I want to do. Is that wrong? Good. Thank you. Wait. I want to go with you. I want to stay with you. So you can change into any of these objects? Like what? Why do you want to look like a humanoid? You're better than they are. You're a changeling. But I know in here that I am inferior to you. But that everyone else here is inferior to me. Then I must be at fault, because I know that you cannot be wrong. I, I want, I want to know more about my people. Who I am and where I come from. Did you ever find them? These are my people? How? [Holosuite] So this is not a real person? How strong is he? Can I? (Odo nods, and he attacks the figure. He easily wins bout one) Can I do it again? Can I have a stronger opponent? It's too easy. Make it more difficult. Computer, increase to level five. [Quark's cafe] Everyone keeps looking at me. They're afraid of me. They should be. I could kill any of them. I don't think so. Maybe there is for you, and maybe there is for all these other people here, but for me You're not sending me anywhere. A runabout. That's not your concern. I know what I'm doing. I'm leaving this place and you're going with me. You don't belong here any more than I do. If they do, I'll kill them. [Corridor] To the Gamma Quadrant. It's where my people are. It's where your people are. It's where we both belong. I won't allow them to put me in a laboratory. I won't go with them to Starfleet. You just don't understand, do you? I want to be with my people. I don't want to be anywhere else. I'm not like these other humanoids. I'm a Jem'Hadar and that's what I want to be. You're not like these humanoids either, but they've done something to you. They've filled your mind with ideas, with these beliefs. I don't know what the other Changelings are like, but I know they're not like you. He was afraid of me. I could see the fear in his eyes. He's not my friend. He's my enemy. And I now know that anyone who is not a Jem'Hadar is my enemy. Victory is life. (The Jem'Hadar march off.) Quick, down that way. Look down that hall. Over there. Victory is life. The Cardassian. Where is he? He is not outside. (The search begins) Move. (The Breen stands up.) He is to be put to death. [Barracks] If you wish to live, explain this. [Ops] I'll ask you for the last time. What is this? She is next. What do you see? We pledge our loyalty to the Founders from now until death. That's not true! The Founders are not to be disturbed. There are no exceptions. Step away from the door, Ferengi. Firing line, take aim. Yes, First. We have the boarding party. Yes, First. Yes, Major. [Runabout Rubicon] Come with me. You there. Stop. Let me see your work order. This has not been approved by the First. You will wait here until the First arrives. You will wait. It's him. Damar. Hold him here. Surrender yourself or die. Halt. Step forward. Slowly. Quiet! You are Legate Damar. He will be taken to Dominion Headquarters. You will die here. I do not understand you. (The Breen shoots both Jem'Hadar. It then removes it's faceplate to reveal Kira.) Understood. It will be done at once. On your feet. We prefer our prisoners to be standing when they die. Enough. Final words are not permitted. Ready weapons. On my mark.

Where is he? He is not outside. (The search begins) Move. (The Breen stands up.) He is to be put to death. [Barracks] If you wish to live, explain this. [Ops] I'll ask you for the last time. What is this? She is next. What do you see? We pledge our loyalty to the Founders from now until death. That's not true! The Founders are not to be disturbed. There are no exceptions. Step away from the door, Ferengi. Firing line, take aim. Yes, First. We have the boarding party. Yes, First. Yes, Major. [Runabout Rubicon] Come with me. You there. Stop. Let me see your work order. This has not been approved by the First. You will wait here until the First arrives. You will wait. It's him. Damar. Hold him here. Surrender yourself or die. Halt. Step forward. Slowly. Quiet! You are Legate Damar. He will be taken to Dominion Headquarters. You will die here. I do not understand you. (The Breen shoots both Jem'Hadar. It then removes it's faceplate to reveal Kira.) Understood. It will be done at once. On your feet. We prefer our prisoners to be standing when they die. Enough. Final words are not permitted. Ready weapons. On my mark. (The Cardassian soldiers shoot the Jem'Hadar.)
You're in my way. He addressed me in a disrespectful tone. I expect you will. (The Jem'Hadar leaves.) There she is. Halt. Put down your weapons. What plan is that? There's nothing wrong with me. Leave me alone. (Odo enters) Something's wrong with me. I feel sick when I eat. I have pains in my head, in my chest. I don't want any more tests. You may run your tests. I don't have a name. If you wish. I want to fight. No. The others. I don't know. But that's what I want to do. Is that wrong? Good. Thank you. Wait. I want to go with you. I want to stay with you. So you can change into any of these objects? Like what? Why do you want to look like a humanoid? You're better than they are. You're a changeling. But I know in here that I am inferior to you. But that everyone else here is inferior to me. Then I must be at fault, because I know that you cannot be wrong. I, I want, I want to know more about my people. Who I am and where I come from. Did you ever find them? These are my people? How? [Holosuite] So this is not a real person? How strong is he? Can I? (Odo nods, and he attacks the figure. He easily wins bout one) Can I do it again? Can I have a stronger opponent? It's too easy. Make it more difficult. Computer, increase to level five. [Quark's cafe] Everyone keeps looking at me. They're afraid of me. They should be. I could kill any of them. I don't think so. Maybe there is for you, and maybe there is for all these other people here, but for me You're not sending me anywhere. A runabout. That's not your concern. I know what I'm doing. I'm leaving this place and you're going with me. You don't belong here any more than I do. If they do, I'll kill them. [Corridor] To the Gamma Quadrant. It's where my people are. It's where your people are. It's where we both belong. I won't allow them to put me in a laboratory. I won't go with them to Starfleet. You just don't understand, do you? I want to be with my people. I don't want to be anywhere else. I'm not like these other humanoids. I'm a Jem'Hadar and that's what I want to be. You're not like these humanoids either, but they've done something to you. They've filled your mind with ideas, with these beliefs.

Did you ever find them? These are my people? How? [Holosuite] So this is not a real person? How strong is he? Can I? (Odo nods, and he attacks the figure. He easily wins bout one) Can I do it again? Can I have a stronger opponent? It's too easy. Make it more difficult. Computer, increase to level five. [Quark's cafe] Everyone keeps looking at me. They're afraid of me. They should be. I could kill any of them. I don't think so. Maybe there is for you, and maybe there is for all these other people here, but for me You're not sending me anywhere. A runabout. That's not your concern. I know what I'm doing. I'm leaving this place and you're going with me. You don't belong here any more than I do. If they do, I'll kill them. [Corridor] To the Gamma Quadrant. It's where my people are. It's where your people are. It's where we both belong. I won't allow them to put me in a laboratory. I won't go with them to Starfleet. You just don't understand, do you? I want to be with my people. I don't want to be anywhere else. I'm not like these other humanoids. I'm a Jem'Hadar and that's what I want to be. You're not like these humanoids either, but they've done something to you. They've filled your mind with ideas, with these beliefs. I don't know what the other Changelings are like, but I know they're not like you. He was afraid of me. I could see the fear in his eyes. He's not my friend. He's my enemy. And I now know that anyone who is not a Jem'Hadar is my enemy. Victory is life. (The Jem'Hadar march off.) Quick, down that way. Look down that hall. Over there. Victory is life. The Cardassian. Where is he? He is not outside. (The search begins) Move. (The Breen stands up.) He is to be put to death. [Barracks] If you wish to live, explain this. [Ops] I'll ask you for the last time. What is this? She is next. What do you see? We pledge our loyalty to the Founders from now until death. That's not true! The Founders are not to be disturbed. There are no exceptions. Step away from the door, Ferengi. Firing line, take aim. Yes, First. We have the boarding party. Yes, First. Yes, Major. [Runabout Rubicon] Come with me. You there. Stop. Let me see your work order. This has not been approved by the First. You will wait here until the First arrives. You will wait. It's him. Damar. Hold him here. Surrender yourself or die. Halt. Step forward. Slowly. Quiet! You are Legate Damar. He will be taken to Dominion Headquarters. You will die here. I do not understand you. (The Breen shoots both Jem'Hadar. It then removes it's faceplate to reveal Kira.) Understood. It will be done at once. On your feet. We prefer our prisoners to be standing when they die. Enough. Final words are not permitted. Ready weapons. On my mark. (The Cardassian soldiers shoot the Jem'Hadar.)
You're in my way. He addressed me in a disrespectful tone. I expect you will. (The Jem'Hadar leaves.) There she is. Halt. Put down your weapons. What plan is that? There's nothing wrong with me. Leave me alone. (Odo enters) Something's wrong with me. I feel sick when I eat. I have pains in my head, in my chest. I don't want any more tests. You may run your tests. I don't have a name. If you wish. I want to fight. No. The others. I don't know. But that's what I want to do. Is that wrong? Good. Thank you. Wait. I want to go with you. I want to stay with you. So you can change into any of these objects? Like what? Why do you want to look like a humanoid? You're better than they are. You're a changeling. But I know in here that I am inferior to you.

This has not been approved by the First. You will wait here until the First arrives. You will wait. It's him. Damar. Hold him here. Surrender yourself or die. Halt. Step forward. Slowly. Quiet! You are Legate Damar. He will be taken to Dominion Headquarters. You will die here. I do not understand you. (The Breen shoots both Jem'Hadar. It then removes it's faceplate to reveal Kira.) Understood. It will be done at once. On your feet. We prefer our prisoners to be standing when they die. Enough. Final words are not permitted. Ready weapons. On my mark. (The Cardassian soldiers shoot the Jem'Hadar.)
You're in my way. He addressed me in a disrespectful tone. I expect you will. (The Jem'Hadar leaves.) There she is. Halt. Put down your weapons. What plan is that? There's nothing wrong with me. Leave me alone. (Odo enters) Something's wrong with me. I feel sick when I eat. I have pains in my head, in my chest. I don't want any more tests. You may run your tests. I don't have a name. If you wish. I want to fight. No. The others. I don't know. But that's what I want to do. Is that wrong? Good. Thank you. Wait. I want to go with you. I want to stay with you. So you can change into any of these objects? Like what? Why do you want to look like a humanoid? You're better than they are. You're a changeling. But I know in here that I am inferior to you. But that everyone else here is inferior to me. Then I must be at fault, because I know that you cannot be wrong. I, I want, I want to know more about my people. Who I am and where I come from. Did you ever find them? These are my people? How? [Holosuite] So this is not a real person? How strong is he? Can I? (Odo nods, and he attacks the figure. He easily wins bout one) Can I do it again? Can I have a stronger opponent? It's too easy. Make it more difficult. Computer, increase to level five. [Quark's cafe] Everyone keeps looking at me. They're afraid of me. They should be. I could kill any of them. I don't think so. Maybe there is for you, and maybe there is for all these other people here, but for me You're not sending me anywhere. A runabout. That's not your concern. I know what I'm doing. I'm leaving this place and you're going with me. You don't belong here any more than I do. If they do, I'll kill them. [Corridor] To the Gamma Quadrant. It's where my people are. It's where your people are. It's where we both belong. I won't allow them to put me in a laboratory. I won't go with them to Starfleet. You just don't understand, do you? I want to be with my people. I don't want to be anywhere else. I'm not like these other humanoids. I'm a Jem'Hadar and that's what I want to be. You're not like these humanoids either, but they've done something to you. They've filled your mind with ideas, with these beliefs. I don't know what the other Changelings are like, but I know they're not like you. He was afraid of me. I could see the fear in his eyes. He's not my friend. He's my enemy. And I now know that anyone who is not a Jem'Hadar is my enemy. Victory is life. (The Jem'Hadar march off.) Quick, down that way. Look down that hall. Over there. Victory is life. The Cardassian. Where is he? He is not outside. (The search begins) Move. (The Breen stands up.) He is to be put to death. [Barracks] If you wish to live, explain this. [Ops] I'll ask you for the last time. What is this? She is next. What do you see? We pledge our loyalty to the Founders from now until death. That's not true! The Founders are not to be disturbed. There are no exceptions.

It's where my people are. It's where your people are. It's where we both belong. I won't allow them to put me in a laboratory. I won't go with them to Starfleet. You just don't understand, do you? I want to be with my people. I don't want to be anywhere else. I'm not like these other humanoids. I'm a Jem'Hadar and that's what I want to be. You're not like these humanoids either, but they've done something to you. They've filled your mind with ideas, with these beliefs. I don't know what the other Changelings are like, but I know they're not like you. He was afraid of me. I could see the fear in his eyes. He's not my friend. He's my enemy. And I now know that anyone who is not a Jem'Hadar is my enemy. Victory is life. (The Jem'Hadar march off.) Quick, down that way. Look down that hall. Over there. Victory is life. The Cardassian. Where is he? He is not outside. (The search begins) Move. (The Breen stands up.) He is to be put to death. [Barracks] If you wish to live, explain this. [Ops] I'll ask you for the last time. What is this? She is next. What do you see? We pledge our loyalty to the Founders from now until death. That's not true! The Founders are not to be disturbed. There are no exceptions. Step away from the door, Ferengi. Firing line, take aim. Yes, First. We have the boarding party. Yes, First. Yes, Major. [Runabout Rubicon] Come with me. You there. Stop. Let me see your work order. This has not been approved by the First. You will wait here until the First arrives. You will wait. It's him. Damar. Hold him here. Surrender yourself or die. Halt. Step forward. Slowly. Quiet! You are Legate Damar. He will be taken to Dominion Headquarters. You will die here. I do not understand you. (The Breen shoots both Jem'Hadar. It then removes it's faceplate to reveal Kira.) Understood. It will be done at once. On your feet. We prefer our prisoners to be standing when they die. Enough. Final words are not permitted. Ready weapons. On my mark. (The Cardassian soldiers shoot the Jem'Hadar.)
You're in my way. He addressed me in a disrespectful tone. I expect you will. (The Jem'Hadar leaves.) There she is. Halt. Put down your weapons. What plan is that? There's nothing wrong with me. Leave me alone. (Odo enters) Something's wrong with me. I feel sick when I eat. I have pains in my head, in my chest. I don't want any more tests. You may run your tests. I don't have a name. If you wish. I want to fight. No. The others. I don't know. But that's what I want to do. Is that wrong? Good. Thank you. Wait. I want to go with you. I want to stay with you. So you can change into any of these objects? Like what? Why do you want to look like a humanoid? You're better than they are. You're a changeling. But I know in here that I am inferior to you. But that everyone else here is inferior to me. Then I must be at fault, because I know that you cannot be wrong. I, I want, I want to know more about my people. Who I am and where I come from. Did you ever find them? These are my people? How? [Holosuite] So this is not a real person? How strong is he? Can I? (Odo nods, and he attacks the figure. He easily wins bout one) Can I do it again? Can I have a stronger opponent? It's too easy. Make it more difficult. Computer, increase to level five. [Quark's cafe] Everyone keeps looking at me. They're afraid of me. They should be. I could kill any of them. I don't think so. Maybe there is for you, and maybe there is for all these other people here, but for me You're not sending me anywhere. A runabout. That's not your concern. I know what I'm doing. I'm leaving this place and you're going with me. You don't belong here any more than I do. If they do, I'll kill them. [Corridor] To the Gamma Quadrant.

Leave me alone. (Odo enters) Something's wrong with me. I feel sick when I eat. I have pains in my head, in my chest. I don't want any more tests. You may run your tests. I don't have a name. If you wish. I want to fight. No. The others. I don't know. But that's what I want to do. Is that wrong? Good. Thank you. Wait. I want to go with you. I want to stay with you. So you can change into any of these objects? Like what? Why do you want to look like a humanoid? You're better than they are. You're a changeling. But I know in here that I am inferior to you. But that everyone else here is inferior to me. Then I must be at fault, because I know that you cannot be wrong. I, I want, I want to know more about my people. Who I am and where I come from. Did you ever find them? These are my people? How? [Holosuite] So this is not a real person? How strong is he? Can I? (Odo nods, and he attacks the figure. He easily wins bout one) Can I do it again? Can I have a stronger opponent? It's too easy. Make it more difficult. Computer, increase to level five. [Quark's cafe] Everyone keeps looking at me. They're afraid of me. They should be. I could kill any of them. I don't think so. Maybe there is for you, and maybe there is for all these other people here, but for me You're not sending me anywhere. A runabout. That's not your concern. I know what I'm doing. I'm leaving this place and you're going with me. You don't belong here any more than I do. If they do, I'll kill them. [Corridor] To the Gamma Quadrant. It's where my people are. It's where your people are. It's where we both belong. I won't allow them to put me in a laboratory. I won't go with them to Starfleet. You just don't understand, do you? I want to be with my people. I don't want to be anywhere else. I'm not like these other humanoids. I'm a Jem'Hadar and that's what I want to be. You're not like these humanoids either, but they've done something to you. They've filled your mind with ideas, with these beliefs. I don't know what the other Changelings are like, but I know they're not like you. He was afraid of me. I could see the fear in his eyes. He's not my friend. He's my enemy. And I now know that anyone who is not a Jem'Hadar is my enemy. Victory is life. (The Jem'Hadar march off.) Quick, down that way. Look down that hall. Over there. Victory is life. The Cardassian. Where is he? He is not outside. (The search begins) Move. (The Breen stands up.) He is to be put to death. [Barracks] If you wish to live, explain this. [Ops] I'll ask you for the last time. What is this? She is next. What do you see? We pledge our loyalty to the Founders from now until death. That's not true! The Founders are not to be disturbed. There are no exceptions. Step away from the door, Ferengi. Firing line, take aim. Yes, First. We have the boarding party. Yes, First. Yes, Major. [Runabout Rubicon] Come with me. You there. Stop. Let me see your work order. This has not been approved by the First. You will wait here until the First arrives. You will wait. It's him. Damar. Hold him here. Surrender yourself or die. Halt. Step forward. Slowly. Quiet! You are Legate Damar. He will be taken to Dominion Headquarters. You will die here. I do not understand you. (The Breen shoots both Jem'Hadar. It then removes it's faceplate to reveal Kira.) Understood. It will be done at once. On your feet. We prefer our prisoners to be standing when they die. Enough. Final words are not permitted. Ready weapons. On my mark.

And I now know that anyone who is not a Jem'Hadar is my enemy. Victory is life. (The Jem'Hadar march off.) Quick, down that way. Look down that hall. Over there. Victory is life. The Cardassian. Where is he? He is not outside. (The search begins) Move. (The Breen stands up.) He is to be put to death. [Barracks] If you wish to live, explain this. [Ops] I'll ask you for the last time. What is this? She is next. What do you see? We pledge our loyalty to the Founders from now until death. That's not true! The Founders are not to be disturbed. There are no exceptions. Step away from the door, Ferengi. Firing line, take aim. Yes, First. We have the boarding party. Yes, First. Yes, Major. [Runabout Rubicon] Come with me. You there. Stop. Let me see your work order. This has not been approved by the First. You will wait here until the First arrives. You will wait. It's him. Damar. Hold him here. Surrender yourself or die. Halt. Step forward. Slowly. Quiet! You are Legate Damar. He will be taken to Dominion Headquarters. You will die here. I do not understand you. (The Breen shoots both Jem'Hadar. It then removes it's faceplate to reveal Kira.) Understood. It will be done at once. On your feet. We prefer our prisoners to be standing when they die. Enough. Final words are not permitted. Ready weapons. On my mark. (The Cardassian soldiers shoot the Jem'Hadar.)
You're in my way. He addressed me in a disrespectful tone. I expect you will. (The Jem'Hadar leaves.) There she is. Halt. Put down your weapons. What plan is that? There's nothing wrong with me. Leave me alone. (Odo enters) Something's wrong with me. I feel sick when I eat. I have pains in my head, in my chest. I don't want any more tests. You may run your tests. I don't have a name. If you wish. I want to fight. No. The others. I don't know. But that's what I want to do. Is that wrong? Good. Thank you. Wait. I want to go with you. I want to stay with you. So you can change into any of these objects? Like what? Why do you want to look like a humanoid? You're better than they are. You're a changeling. But I know in here that I am inferior to you. But that everyone else here is inferior to me. Then I must be at fault, because I know that you cannot be wrong. I, I want, I want to know more about my people. Who I am and where I come from. Did you ever find them? These are my people? How? [Holosuite] So this is not a real person? How strong is he? Can I? (Odo nods, and he attacks the figure. He easily wins bout one) Can I do it again? Can I have a stronger opponent? It's too easy. Make it more difficult. Computer, increase to level five. [Quark's cafe] Everyone keeps looking at me. They're afraid of me. They should be. I could kill any of them. I don't think so. Maybe there is for you, and maybe there is for all these other people here, but for me You're not sending me anywhere. A runabout. That's not your concern. I know what I'm doing. I'm leaving this place and you're going with me. You don't belong here any more than I do. If they do, I'll kill them. [Corridor] To the Gamma Quadrant. It's where my people are. It's where your people are. It's where we both belong. I won't allow them to put me in a laboratory. I won't go with them to Starfleet. You just don't understand, do you?

Did you ever find them? These are my people? How? [Holosuite] So this is not a real person? How strong is he? Can I? (Odo nods, and he attacks the figure. He easily wins bout one) Can I do it again? Can I have a stronger opponent? It's too easy. Make it more difficult. Computer, increase to level five. [Quark's cafe] Everyone keeps looking at me. They're afraid of me. They should be. I could kill any of them. I don't think so. Maybe there is for you, and maybe there is for all these other people here, but for me You're not sending me anywhere. A runabout. That's not your concern. I know what I'm doing. I'm leaving this place and you're going with me. You don't belong here any more than I do. If they do, I'll kill them. [Corridor] To the Gamma Quadrant. It's where my people are. It's where your people are. It's where we both belong. I won't allow them to put me in a laboratory. I won't go with them to Starfleet. You just don't understand, do you? I want to be with my people. I don't want to be anywhere else. I'm not like these other humanoids. I'm a Jem'Hadar and that's what I want to be. You're not like these humanoids either, but they've done something to you. They've filled your mind with ideas, with these beliefs. I don't know what the other Changelings are like, but I know they're not like you. He was afraid of me. I could see the fear in his eyes. He's not my friend. He's my enemy. And I now know that anyone who is not a Jem'Hadar is my enemy. Victory is life. (The Jem'Hadar march off.) Quick, down that way. Look down that hall. Over there. Victory is life. The Cardassian. Where is he? He is not outside. (The search begins) Move. (The Breen stands up.) He is to be put to death. [Barracks] If you wish to live, explain this. [Ops] I'll ask you for the last time. What is this? She is next. What do you see? We pledge our loyalty to the Founders from now until death. That's not true! The Founders are not to be disturbed. There are no exceptions. Step away from the door, Ferengi. Firing line, take aim. Yes, First. We have the boarding party. Yes, First. Yes, Major. [Runabout Rubicon] Come with me. You there. Stop. Let me see your work order. This has not been approved by the First. You will wait here until the First arrives. You will wait. It's him. Damar. Hold him here. Surrender yourself or die. Halt. Step forward. Slowly. Quiet! You are Legate Damar. He will be taken to Dominion Headquarters. You will die here. I do not understand you. (The Breen shoots both Jem'Hadar. It then removes it's faceplate to reveal Kira.) Understood. It will be done at once. On your feet. We prefer our prisoners to be standing when they die. Enough. Final words are not permitted. Ready weapons. On my mark. (The Cardassian soldiers shoot the Jem'Hadar.)
You're in my way. He addressed me in a disrespectful tone. I expect you will. (The Jem'Hadar leaves.) There she is. Halt. Put down your weapons. What plan is that? There's nothing wrong with me. Leave me alone. (Odo enters) Something's wrong with me. I feel sick when I eat. I have pains in my head, in my chest. I don't want any more tests. You may run your tests. I don't have a name. If you wish. I want to fight. No. The others. I don't know. But that's what I want to do. Is that wrong? Good. Thank you. Wait. I want to go with you. I want to stay with you. So you can change into any of these objects? Like what? Why do you want to look like a humanoid? You're better than they are. You're a changeling. But I know in here that I am inferior to you.
